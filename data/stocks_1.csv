The stock perked my nips some time ago so i threw some money at it last week during one of the dips. I bought with the intention of holding and this past friday it shot up 30 min before market close. This supplier seems to be doing well even though the people it supplies to (pot growers) dont know how to run their shit. Might be a stock worth having since the graphs show its been slowly climbing on revenue and stock price. 


""Grow Generation primarily offers specialty hydroponic supplies to the cannabis market. At the time of this writing the company had 25 store locations in eight states. In December the company uplisted to the Nasdaq.

In the third quarter it generated revenue of $21.8 million, up 159 percent year-over-year, and up 12 percent sequentially. Operating profits came in at $1.1 million. It has had three quarters in a row of positive EBITDA. The company has guided for 2019 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.14-$0.18.

A huge positive for Grow Generation is its hefty 48 percent of organic growth. That points to the markets it competes in having significant demand. It has also benefited from acquisitions and new stores, especially in the Oklahoma market.

The company obviously won't be able to continue 48 percent organic growth in its stores that have been operational for some time, but it still has a lot of organic growth left in it from new stores.

What's important for Grow Generation Corp. is it doesn't matter who wins the battle for market share for those companies touching the cannabis plant; they'll need what the company supplies no matter who it is.

The major question for Grow Generation over the long term is how it'll do as competition in its segment heats up. In the near term the company should continue to do very well as market conditions improve and demand for cannabis continues to soar.

The company's major risk appears to be the availability of capital for its customers. If they struggle to obtain funding, they'll have less to spend on supplies they need. This could temporarily slow down growth for Grow Generation. Ladenburg analyst Glenn Mattson recently noted, ""As GRWG gains in size it is builidng the infrastruture to support it. GRWG is in the process of implementing an ERP system, which appears to be going well, as gains from efficiencies were listed as a factor in the strong gross margins in the quarter. The company also hired a new COO, Tony Sullivan, who has experience with large retail chains having been Senior VP at Dollar Express (a Family Dollar carve out with 330 stores), as well as 20+ years at Foot Locker serving as Senior VP of store operations in charge of over 2100 stores. This is in addition to bringing in Bob Nardelli, former CEO of Home Depot, to serve as a strategic advisor last quarter. With seasoned leadership our confidence is growing that the company can manage through this rapid growth period.""

According to Mattson, GRWG is worth over 70% than it’s currently selling for, and should hit $7 within the next 12 months.""  TIPRANKS.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,495183,public,self,GRWG-GrowGeneration,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f5avn4/grwggrowgeneration/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

A disclaimer to start off, I'm from Bangladesh so it's not the US stock market but the local one.

I'm not really sure how to go about from here, as my initial plan was to just put $400 into these 5 companies every month. However, that seems to be a waste as I'm not learning and earning.

I am a graduate student in Psychology at California State University,  Northridge. My current research involves a new method of predicting  future events and the role of expertise in the accuracy of these  predictions. Specifically, we are looking at people’s ability to predict  stock prices and how it relates to their stock knowledge. Participation is free, and we are offering a $100 Amazon gift card for the person  with the most accurate predictions, as well as a $100 Amazon gift card  for the person with the most accurate predictions of others’  predictions.

The only requirement for participation is completion of an initial  survey to evaluate your knowledge about finance – you need not be an “expert” to participate, though. You will also be required to enter an  email address to receive the main survey. The knowledge survey will  remain open until 2/19 at 12 AM EST. On 2/20 at 4:30 EST, you will be  emailed the main survey to complete your predictions. The survey will  consist of you predicting whether the price of a series of stocks in the S&amp;P will be higher or lower one month from the closing bell on 2/20, your confidence in each of those predictions, and your estimate of  how many other participants will make the same prediction.

I’ll be posting this in several sub-reddits, so if you see this  posted elsewhere, please do not take it more than once. We thank you for  your participation. Here is the link to the initial expertise  questionnaire:

The fact that Canadian banks need to change negative loan loss provisions to positive loan loss provisions. Also the fact that a majority of banks in Canada are holding the mortgage debt, and that Canada does not have a big securitization market like the USA.

Lets say Trump wins in 2020, that means he has maxed out his terms, and in 2024 if the economy is still chugging along, and people want more of Trump, they will vote for his successor, Pence.

Therefore I think Pence is probably considering a future run (which is why is so obedient to Trump and backs everything he does) and he could very well win in 2024 since he will position himself as someone to carry on Trump's legacy and continue to do what Trump did (all pending on the economy not crashing in the next 4 years).",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,493968,public,self,Why Pence will run for president in the future and might actually win,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f4j9mb/why_pence_will_run_for_president_in_the_future/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I’ve been eyeing SPCE since its IPO, and I was really hoping to get in especially during its initial dip, but it just seems so volatile because you’re investing in an idea more than a product. Don’t get me wrong though, the concept of space travel is certainly so incredible.

I was hoping to invest in Space X if it ever goes public, which was my justification for not investing in SPCE. Now, I’m starting to think that Space X might not have the biggest chance of going public, especially now.

Anyway, do any of you have any insight on SPCE and any advice whether to invest in some shared Tuesday morning? Any advice would be incredible!

Also, since Reddit was the first place I heard about SPCE and many other stocks that have gone to the moon, do any of you have any advice on what to get next week?

Currently, my portfolio is more focused on biotech, but I also love solar and MSFT of course, but I’m willing to look at anything!

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020.

# **Stocks expected to rise even as virus creates volatility: ‘The market thinks the worst is over’  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/stocks-expected-to-rise-even-as-virus-creates-volatility-the-market-thinks-the-worst-is-over.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to remain hostage to developments involving the coronavirus in the week ahead, and even so, the market could continue to hit new highs.
*****
&gt; Economists have been reducing China’s growth outlook for the quarter, with some seeing little or no growth and then a bounce back in the high single digits next quarter. The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.
*****
&gt; “It does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there’s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can’t believe what’s coming out of China.”
*****
&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. “The market didn’t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There’s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,” he said.
*****
&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday’s Empire State and Thursday’s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.
*****
&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.
*****
&gt; # Profit warnings
&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.
*****
&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.
*****
&gt; “This is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains” and exporters, said Keon. “It will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn’t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.”
*****
&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.
*****
&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.
*****
&gt; “There will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,” Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.
*****
&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.
*****
&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. “Could we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,” he said.
*****
&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. “It trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,” he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.
*****
&gt; # Resilient market
&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there’s more clarity on the virus.
*****
&gt; “I had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we’re there,” said Sluymer. “I don’t have a year-end target but I think it’s higher. I think we’re in a sloppy range. I think it’s range bound.”
*****
&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. “Stocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,” he said.
*****
&gt; Keon said he’s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. “I think it’s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year. But that’s the way we have our portfolios positioned — the market will work its way higher this year,” he said.

# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 12 of Last 14

&gt; February’s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 26 years with an average loss of 0.20% for S&amp;P 500. Despite a bumpy finish, expiration week as a whole has fared better, but nets an average gain of just 0.47% on the S&amp;P 500 since 1994 with 17 of 26 winning weeks. More recently, S&amp;P 500 has advanced in twelve of the last fourteen options expiration weeks. The week after, has been down 13 of the last 26 years. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar patterns over the same timeframe.

# Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Still Weak

&gt; Yesterday’s post, showed improvement the two days before Presidents’ Day Weekend the past 10 years. But the two days after still display a lot of red. Since 1990 Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 12 losses for median gain of 0.14% and an average loss of –0.22%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is net loser down 18 of 30 years with and average loss of –0.50% and a median loss of –0.21%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has greater magnitude of decline. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 30 with an average loss of –0.08% and a median decline of –0.16%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 30, average –0.04%, median –0.11% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 30, average –0.04%, median –0.14%.

# Closer Look At February

&gt; A late month selloff in January saw the S&amp;P 500 Index close marginally lower for the month. But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.

&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn’t be a total surprise? “Yes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Yet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.” In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October’s gain of 2.29%.

# A Record Pace of Records

&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.

# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap

&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.

&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**

&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**

&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.

# Things Are Looking Up

&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.

&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER
&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren’t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.

&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS
&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don’t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.

&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS
&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.

# Another ""Delay"" in the Value Trade

&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of ""The time for value stocks to outperform is now."" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**

&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.

&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.

&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.

I wanted to share a situation that happened this week that made me a bit frustrated. I wanted to know if anyone has experienced this and what they have done to improve. 

Background: This is my second year investing in the market.  I mainly do swing trades, 2-3 each week. Recently, I have become consistently profitable using a system that I developed over the past year. I  like to add that I have lost my fair share of money in the markets. The vicious cycle of blowing an account and humbling yourself back to trading ETF's. I have been there and don't ever want to go back so I do what I can to learn as much as possible from my mistakes and always try to have an open mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a fan a diversification. I believe every stock has a characteristic and the more you study them the more likely you are to place successful trades. That being said, I invest only in one stock and give it my entire attention.  I like plan my trades the day before I make them. Here is my weekly plan 

Monday: Watch chart all day 

Tuesday: Enter position

Wednesday: Exit Position, Enter 2nd Position

Thursday:Exit 2nd Position, Enter 3rd Position

Friday: Exit 3rd Position, Depending on circumstances, I'll enter 4th position and exit Monday

&amp;#x200B;

Now keep in mind that it doesn't always work out like this, sometimes I'll watch the chart for 2-3 days before entering a position. Sometimes I won't enter at all. However, I do make sure I watch the charts at least one day before I enter. I also make sure there is high volume and ride with the momentum. I want to say that this is specifically based around the characteristics of this particular stock I Invest in. 

This week I exceeded my weekly 2% goal by 1% but I still feel the same way after a loss. The week started off perfect, the exact way as my weekly plan. All trades had profit and everything was going well. On Wednesday, the charts opened strong and continued on till half of the day  then it started to decline. Now, I have noticed  the times with the most volume are at the open, middle, and close. Below is somewhat of a checklist i have

Opens strong: Sell within the the first 1-2 hours   
Opens with sell off: Sell during Middle or close

Opens with low volume: This is the tricky part because I don't have that many trading experience during low volume so I don't really know what to do. 

That day I missed the first 3 hours and when I checked the charts I saw the charts had already peaked and showed a clear decline. Knowing this, I exited. I exited because I was in profit and was unsure of the direction. I was okay with this. My plan for that day was the same, buy the dip and sell the next day .I knew that my mistake had nothing to do with my plan. It was just me being negligent. 

Hour goes by: Shows gradual decline with pullbacks (Interesting but doesn't qualify for the ""dip"")

Another hour goes by: The charts are soaring 2x the peak breaking resistance.

I immediately feel stupid because that would have been a 3% trade (6% excluding margin). I remind myself that opportunities come and go and let it go (or so I thought). 

The next day I watch the charts to find new support and resistance. I find a potential dip, it  meets all my requirements. However, I start to second guess myself because of previous sloppy trade. So I sit out waiting for a bigger decline to reduce the risk. The day goes by and I end of sitting out because I am unsure if My plan is right. 

Today rolls by and it opens strong again and gains another percent past yesterdays high. Had I trusted my gut and placed the trade I would have landed an extra 2% ( 4% excluding margin).

I know at the end of the day these trades don't matter, what matters is the capital I ended  with and my plan for my next entry.

I apologize for the long post but I wanted to share as much information as possible.

My Questions are:

How do I find out if I am second guessing myself?

How do I let go of a sloppy trade?

What are some authors I can look into when it comes to Trading Psychology?

What is a book that you believe has helped you with being aware of your emotions when trading?

What is the one thing that has separated you from being a hobby trader to a dedicated trader?

&amp;#x200B;

SPCE is, at this point, purely for space tourism and some scientific contracts for sub-orbital flight work.

Being T1 diabetic, it's a ballache. Constant finger pricks and blood testing every day. Along comes Dexcom with a handy device called a CGM(Constant glucose monitor) that sticks onto your arm. No more finger pricking and no more blood on my keyboard after testing. I can see my blood sugar levels in real-time on my phone or watch. A life changer for every other diabetic I know using one.

I decided to invest in Dexcom as it was something I really believed in changing the way millions of people manage their diabetes. In the UK they are the only CGM supplier on the NHS and with only Abbot offering a similar inferior product. 

With two new products being released later this year by them, one affordable for the NHS and one 'all bells and whistles', I'm confident they can keep this strong growth and position.

Hi everyone, hope you’re all doing well. I am a college senior, and have been dabbling in the trading-business for a couple years now. I started out with no real knowledge, but after taking a couple courses and learning from the internet I am able to pinpoint trends and make decent bets; although, because I play the risk game I’ve seen bad days in which I’ve lost upwards of 10-20% of my portfolio..

My current strategy is keeping a close eye on the news; any big changes in industry, a firm, economy etc. that could be seen to turn a profit somehow. I haven’t played with options too much, but when I have I’ve made huge returns or losses. 

My goal is to be able to invest early on in my life that I’m able to create a comfortable living for myself and my future family (and maybe even retire early?); don’t want my family to live through struggle like I did. 

I would appreciate any piece of advice from those who’ve seen success or have been in the game longer than I have.

Maby its kinda greedy i don't know.
How do you guys determine when it is time to sell your stock and secure your profits?

Currently im in the spot that my depot is closing in at a 300% upside.
Right now, i think those stocks have still some more potential but they won't rise forever and i don't want to sell them at 200% and think back that i could have sold them for much more.
Is the problem my mindset? Should i just be okay and gratefull if i sell them for 200%?

I don't need the money and right now i wouldn't know where to invest the profits, so the cash would be lying around. So this alone is a good reason not to sell. But at some point i think i have to do it anyways.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I have big gains on SPCE with an average share price of $12.98 and DEAC with an average share price of  $12.08. With how volatile these stocks are I want to lock in gains before things might go south. I watch these every day and try to stay current with news, but i'm thinking of putting a trailing stop loss at 15%? My understanding is since SPCE is at $23.66, a 15% would start the trailing stop order at $20.12 and move up as it gains?

Space...the final frontier, and Richard Branson seems set on capitalizing it.  Virgin Galactic (SPCE) offers a revolutionary, one of a kind experience, where customers can fly into and experience space in a commercial spacecraft flight.  Yes, this may seem like an absurd business to some, with a questionable consumer base; however, let's examine this business.  
    Branson has established a public business with no current rival or any foreseeable one given the infrastructure necessary to achieve these space flights.  In this sense SPCE has already cornered the commercial space flight market or at the very least has a large head start versus any future competitors. One may ask, who would the consumers be in this market? Given the likely high cost of such flights, it does not seem like this would appeal to the average citizen.  That said, how would you like to tell someone you’ve been to space? Adventurists and thrill seekers alike will seek this experience. At first maybe only the affluent will hop on board this opportunity. I see a high likelihood of celebrities and other popular public figures being some of the first to seek the SPCE experience.  This is essentially free PR for SPCE, with celebrities sharing their stories of their journey into space, which will highly appeal to the average consumer. As investment into SPCE grows, which it seems like Branson is set on, infrastructure will grow and flights will become cheaper. Eventually, one of these flights may only cost what an upper level commercial flight costs (a few thousand dollars).  At this price point I expect the average consumers interest to be piqued, as an option for a family vacation even. This may seem crazy to you, especially as an idea for a family vacation, but let me reiterate... this is a ONCE in a lifetime experience, where you can tell people you have been off Earth and share the story. As the price comes down and stories of this experience spread, I expect even more interest to arise, furthering SPCE profits and driving down price for space flights even further.  
Long term, I could see this as a breakthrough to a new method of travel, much like the emergence of commercial air flight after the invention of the airplane.  Branson has commented about the prospects of space travel to other planets, which seems like a given when looking towards the distant future. He has also brought up the possibility of asteroid mining to harvest natural resources, which could yield unheard of profits from rare and precious metals with an almost limitless supply available.  While these prospects are only speculative and may seem farfetched, we must look towards the future. The expansion into space seems a certainty to continue our civilization and will be the next major source of real estate given our ever increasing domestic population. While this expansion isn’t imminent, I believe by 2050 this will be a viable goal for people and governments around the world.  The investments made into space exploration by governments already seem to support this argument. That said, I see SPCE as a long term investment with a large head start in the space sector. This could be a quickly emerging, trillion dollar business by 2050.  
While this all may seem highly speculative, let’s look at the founder of Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson.  Richard Branson is an eccentric billionaire with visions of the future many see as lofty and unrealistic. He seems highly invested in the future of technology and mankind.  Does this story seem familar? It should. His story seems to parallel that of business magnate Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Inc. People were speculative of Musk’s vision in Tesla as well, stating they didn’t see how Tesla could ever achieve profit.  Yet, just recently Tesla was declared as the most valuable automotive company of all time. Like Tesla, I expect SPCE to report negative revenue for some time before becoming profitable, maybe even taking longer than Tesla. However, once SPCE does see a profit, like Tesla, I expect this business to take off rapidly.
The previous stated, I expect SPCE to see slow to moderate growth for some time; however, I believe now is an opportunity to buy into the ground floor of a future powerhouse industry, that has the ability to revolutionize the market.  Others seem to recognize the potential of the business as well with gains in shares up over 100% since its IPO late last year. I believe an investment in Virgin Galactic is an investment into the future, which could see a massive market capitalization as soon as 5 years from now, and be a market mainstay by as soon as 2030.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,492416,public,self,The Case for SPCE,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f3ko3q/the_case_for_spce/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

VIRGIN GALACTIC WELCOMES SPACESHIPTWO UNITY TO SPACEPORT AMERICA, NEW MEXICO


FEBRUARY, 13, 2020
Virgin Galactic Captive Carry Test Flight Marks Relocation of Spaceflight Operations to Spaceport America

TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE) (“Virgin Galactic” or “the Company”), a vertically integrated aerospace company, has successfully completed another vital step on its path to commercial service, relocating SpaceShipTwo,VSS Unity, to its commercial headquarters at Spaceport America’s Gateway to Space building.

VSS Unity, attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve, made the journey from Mojave, California, where the Company’s manufacturing facilities are based. The vehicle landed at 15:49 MT, where it was greeted by an enthusiastic group of teammates who will operate the spaceship in New Mexico.

This captive carry flight provided an opportunity for engineers to evaluate VSSUnity for over three hours at high altitude and cold temperatures, a longer period of time than is experienced during missions to space. These environmental evaluations of system performance are difficult to replicate at ground level, making captive carry missions a vital component of VSS Unity’s flight test plan.

The flight also provided a valuable opportunity to conduct pilot training and familiarization, with veteran Italian Air Force Test Pilot Nicola ‘Stick’ Pecile joining Chief Pilot Dave ‘Mac’ Mackay in the cockpit of the spaceship for the first time. Nicola is the fifth pilot to complete a flight in VSS Unity. VMS Eve was piloted by Mike ‘Sooch’ Masucci and Frederick ‘CJ’ Sturckow.

The move of the spaceship to Spaceport America marks a key step in the relocation of Virgin Galactic’s to the state of New Mexico. In May 2019, Virgin Galactic announced that as part of this move, approximately 100 teammates would move to New Mexico from Mojave, California, Spaceport America would become operational and the vehicles would be transferred to the Gateway to Space. Today, nearly all of those team members have relocated, the spaceport is operationally ready, and both VMS Eve and VSS Unity have now arrived. Of Virgin Galactic’s total current New Mexico work force, more than 70 team members have been hired locally, the result of a conscious effort to attract New Mexico-based talent.

“New Mexico is going to be the world’s launchpad for commercial spaceflight,” New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said. “Today marks another step closer: We will have a genuine Space Valley in Southern New Mexico, a hotbed of innovation and achievement and space tourism development. I congratulate Virgin Galactic’s workers, George Whitesides and Sir Richard Branson on today’s successful flight – and once again I say to them: Welcome to New Mexico, we’re very glad to have you!”

“When Virgin Galactic started moving to New Mexico last year, everyone felt the sheer magnitude of the task ahead, but we were encouraged and excited by the team’s confidence and strong vision for the future,” said George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic. “Today we realized the next step in that dream by bringing our beautiful spaceship to New Mexico. We still have significant work ahead, but we are grateful to all our teammates who have made this day a reality.”

The relocation of VSS Unity to Spaceport America enables the Company to engage in the final stages of its flight test program. This will begin with a number of initial captive carry and glide flights from the new operating base in New Mexico, allowing the spaceflight operations team to familiarize themselves with the airspace and ground control. Once these tests are complete, the team will carry out a number of rocket-powered test flights from Spaceport America to continue the evaluation of VSS Unity’s performance. During this phase, the final spaceship cabin and customer experience evaluations will also be concluded in preparation for the start of commercial spaceflight operations.

The Spaceship Company, Virgin Galactic’s design, testing and manufacturing arm, remains firmly rooted in Mojave, California. While VMS Eve and VSS Unity are now based in New Mexico, they will make periodic journeys back to Mojave to support ground and flight tests of new spaceships, as well as for vehicle maintenance and upgrade activities. There is significant progress being made on the next two spaceships, including achieving the Weight on Wheels milestone for the second spaceship and completing over 50% of the structural and system part fabrication for the third spaceship, which were announced in January.

Dan Hicks, Spaceport America’s Executive Director, congratulated the Virgin Galactic team, saying, “This truly is the dawn of a new era for the commercial space sector. We are tremendously proud of our foundational partner Virgin Galactic - as we see and support their historic progress in making human space flight a reality for our beautiful world. The New Mexico and Spaceport America leadership will continue our strong support for our visionary Virgin Galactic teammates; and we are looking forward to an exciting 2020!”",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,492374,public,self,SPCE Press Release 02/13/2020,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f3jntp/spce_press_release_02132020/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Asking for some advice no what do you think I should do to mitigate my losses, and maybe even turn a profit for this particular Out-of-the-Money position that I have entered, that has swung the other way.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently hold 80 call contracts for MARCH-20 stock at a strike of 50 for underlying CHGG(Chegg Inc.)  with a cost-per-share of $0.5004 and a total cost of $4,003.29 (including commission)

On February 10th, I placed 15. Later that night, they released the earnings report, which was really positive, and I was sure i was going to make some money the next day. However, the underlying plummeted over 8%, I kept adding more contracts to bring the cost basis down, which I have brought it down to $0.5004 per share for a total of 80 contracts.

As of right now (FEB-13-2020 1:56PM eastern), the stock has not gone back up, and its sitting right under \~$40 for the underlying. Im currently $10 Out-of-the-money and the delta for my contract is at 0.0719 and the theta is at -0.0108.

Without doing anything on my end, I need this stock to jump up a little over \~4 points relatively quick in order to break even, before THETA starts to effect it more.  

I really do believe this stock will recover, but I think im so out of the money, that I need to take some sort of action in order to break even, or record a profit.

If I rolldown the position down to a strike of 40, it will cost me around $12,746(including comissiom). But at that point I will need only a point or two rise, in order to break even due to the delta.

Besides the good Earnings Report earlier this week, there are many analysts that have upped the price target with a median price target of $45+. None of the analysts have the stock as a sell, two have it as a HOLD, and the other 15+ have it as a buy.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on YOUR experience;

1) would you take any action yet, or would you wait a few more days?

2) What action would you take and why?

3) any other input would be greatly appreciated.

This AM on Squawk Andrew made his belief that Alibaba is nothing like Amazon in that they are less capital expensive. Not sure I am agreeing with his take here, warehouse on the business insider show (robot warehouse) sure looked like Amazon warehouses. Bottom line though is that these are Cloud businesses (that is how they make their profits), and Alibaba owns most of Cloud market in China, and has agreements with upcoming Olympics (Tokyo, Paris, LA) and likely Beijing World Cup 2030-34 to supply cloud infrastructure for Broadcasting etc. These are huge events and I think speak to their Cloud business.

I was looking for a similar list online, but I haven't found a comprehensive one, so I thought of putting one together.  

&amp;#x200B;

|Ticker|YTD Return|

|RCL|\-12.90%|
|BWA|\-20.03%|
|LEA|\-7.79%|

|CCL|\-13.32%|
|NCLH|\-7.19%|
|MMM|\-7.15%|
|YUMC|\-5.39%|

Keep in mind this is a very simplified list and it might not take into account a few factors that are important to make educated investing decisions.

And it is probably too early to buy the dip.

* Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, after he barely received support in either the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary.

(HOLI)** 

HOLI is a leading provider of automation and systems solutions in China, with overseas operations in eight other countries throughout Asia. The majority of its business is done in the industrial automation (IA) and rail transportation sectors, though it has low-margin operations in mechanical &amp; electrical (M&amp;E) and medical solutions as well. A miniscule debt-to-equity ratio, healthy historical cash flows, promising growth based on planned expansion in relevant sectors, and the Great Wall of China doubling as an economic moat all suggest taking a long position while the stock price hovers near its 52-week low. 

***Business Profile***

Founded in 1993 and listed on NASDAQ since 2008, HOLI has grown from research team specializing in automation control in the power industry to a multinational company with customers in sectors including power, petrochemical, high-speed rail, and urban rail. In IA, HOLI provides automation hardware, software, and services spanning field devices, control systems, enterprise manufacturing management and cloud-based applications. In rail transportation, it provides advanced signaling control and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for high-speed rail and urban rail. 

HOLI designs and manufactures all its products in-house at its facilities in Beijing and Hangzhou. Its core hardware is a printed circuit board, manufactured and assembled at the two Chinese facilities. Raw materials include bare printed circuit boards and various electronic components needed for assembly. 

Approximately 82% of the company’s total consolidated revenues are derived from integrated solutions contracts won through the bid process. The remainder of revenue is generated through sales of spare parts, maintenance, and training services after the warranty period from the contracts has ended. 

Ok, I kind of get it. So why should I be interested?

1. **An Impeccable Balance Sheet:** After paying off its 20M convertible bond in Q1 of FY20, the company has total debt of only 2.5M. That’s good for a D/E ratio of 0.003, quite a bit lower than the 0.557 average of its competitors. It’s average OCF margin over the last three years is 19%, well above industry averages, and its average CFO/NI ratio over the same period is 0.99.
2. **Urbanization:** Rapid industrialization and warped demographics has manifested in dramatic urbanization and economic integration, which in turn creates a critical need for infrastructure. Grand infrastructure goals are what a planned economy like China does best. While the world awaits the details of the PRC’s 14th Five Year Plan, you can bet HOLI will be busy servicing Chinese needs for high-speed rail and subway transit.
3. **Limited Domestic Competition:** While large multinationals account for the majority of global automation market share, to the extent this is true in China does not extend to the verticals in which Hollysys makes most of its profits. Specifically, the high barriers to entry for servicing nuclear power plants and high-speed rail gives the company an enviable moat around a significant portion of its revenue share. 

***Valuation***

Currently, HOLI’s sustainable competitive advantage comes from its specialized offerings of high-speed rail signaling systems to ensure the safety of passenger train movement. The China Train Control System (CTCS) is a country specific high-speed rail standard and therefore is different from international standards propounded by European organizations or Japan. This barrier to entry makes HOLI the largest provider in a growing market. In fact, their 39% market share from 2015-2018 for total automatic train protection (ATP) sets sold made them the largest Chinese company in the domestic automation market. Rail is also the division in which the company has its highest profit margins.

HOLI’s revenue comes from three main offerings: IA, Rail, and M&amp;E. Historically, the revenue share between the three divisions has been very stable: 40%, 36%, and 23%, respectively. In 2019 and 2018, the company had a GP% of 37% and 38%. Over those two years, IA posted a GP% of 41% and 40% while Rail posted a GP% of 48% and 52%. M&amp;E were by far its lowest margin operations with a GP% of 13% both years. The company does not provide revenue figures by geographical area for each division, but it does break out total revenues by geographical area. We can infer from this breakout and from other financial and marketing materials that almost all IA and Rail revenue is derived from business in the PRC while M&amp;E revenue is generated from its foreign subsidiaries in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Middle East. 

China’s high-speed railway operating mileage, currently the largest in the world, has grown from 19,000km in 2016 to 32,000km at the end of 2019, covering 80% of China’s major cities and surpassing the 30,000km goal by 2020 laid out under the 13th Five Year Plan. Though the details of infrastructure goals won’t be released until the next five year plan in 2021, high-speed rail is expected to be at least a $4.4 billion industry by 2023, with maintenance and replacement accounting for a rapidly growing share of expenditures. Higher growth is expected in the urban rail transit sector, which is expected to grow from 5,500km to 9,276km by 2023. In general, infrastructure needs are driven by the rapid urbanization and regional economic integration and is supported by ambitious policies such as the five year plans, Eight Horizontal and Eight Vertical High-speed Railway Corridors project, and the Belt and Road Initiatives. With its leading market share in these industries, HOLI is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. ­

China’s industrial automation market is similarly poised for accelerated growth. Total contract amount from industrial automation in China grew at a 4.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2014 to 2018 and reached a total value of $30.1 billion. The market is estimated to accelerate that growth to 11.1% CAGR from 2018 to 2023 and reach $50.6 billion. Over that same time, petrochemicals and power are expected to grow at CAGRs of 14.5% and 5.8%, respectively. While competition in the industrial automation market is stiffer, HOLI’s roots in automation for power and petrochemicals, growing name brand recognition in China, advanced technology, and cash-rich position give it a good position to increase its market share. Importantly, HOLI has a unique advantage when it comes to nuclear power. 

The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster threw a major wrench into China’s plans for nuclear power. To reassure the population that the country was not a risk of a similar catastrophe, the PRC placed a moratorium on the construction of new power plants. After lifting that ban in 2019, the country has 47 nuclear reactors in commercial operation, with twelve more under constructions and more on the way. The impetus for nuclear power in China has increased due to air pollution from coal-fired plants and as a result the country has subsidized nuclear power with an aim to match and surpass the world average of 15% for total electricity generated by nuclear power (currently at 4.75%). HOLI is the only qualified local automation and control product provider to the non-safety control for nuclear power stations. In the nuclear automation segment, HOLI competes with multi-national corporations such as Siemens, Areva, and Invensys, but with the abnormal glut in demand created by the Fukushima disaster HOLI has a prime opportunity to increase its market share.

The M&amp;E division offers solutions through Concord and Bond Groups, two subsidiaries acquired by HOLI in 2011 and 2013, respectively, in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Hong Kong. While this division has the lowest revenue and profit margins in relation to the company’s other operations, it also offers its greatest opportunity for business expansion and diversification. A 2019 partnering with the London engineering consulting firm Arup signals a willingness to expand the M&amp;E offerings, potentially through more acquisitions. While profitable, the revenues generated by this division do not significantly affect our valuation of the company. Barring any interesting acquisitions, the only growth we forecast for M&amp;E is over the long-term.

An important measure in our valuation comes from HOLI’s dedication to research and development. Historically, the company spends 6-7% of revenue on R&amp;D, and 40%, or 1,500 employees, of the 3,200 person company work in R&amp;D. Their proprietary technology is at the center of their rail and power offerings – as of June 30, 2019, HOLI held 221 software copyrights, 126 authorized patents, 64 pending patent applications, and 44 registered trademarks. The Chairman and CEO, Shao Baiqing, has been with the company for more than 25 years starting as one of the founding engineers, and “is widely regarded as an industry leader with significant influence in China.” 

Despite the fact that EBITDA has grown over 60% since FY17, HOLI has an EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 3.  Not only is this well below the historical multiple for the company, it is also low enough to be a solid multiple for a coal company. Taking into account the growing industrial automation and high-speed transit sectors in China, while accounting for some slowdown in infrastructure spending in the current year as the window of the 12th Five Year Plan is closing having already surpassed expected rail mileage, we use a conservative estimate of 5% revenue growth rate YoY. We see no reason for net income growth to lag behind this rate. Using consistent conservative estimates to project unlevered free cash flow, and re-levering the beta to reflect average competitor beta, we arrive at a fair value of $25 per share, close to a 60% discount rate.

***Risks***

* Corona virus may mutate and spread, further depressing Chinese stock values for an unknown amount of time.
* Escalations by either the U.S. or China in their trade war could negatively affect trade relations or may cause further slowdowns in Chinese economic growth and depreciation of the RMB. This has the potential to adversely impact HOLI’s supply chain for its products and stifle the demand for capital projects and domestic investment in China.
* The Beijing and Hangzhou subsidiaries of Hollysys are recognized as high and new technology enterprises, or HNTEs, by the PRC government, which entitle each of them to a reduced income tax rate of 15% (compared to the statutory income tax rate of 25%). Additionally, HOLI received VAT refunds and government subsidies of $33 million in FY2019. If the HNTE status is not renewed for those subsidiaries, or the PRC stops recognizing HOLI as a qualified research and development enterprise deserving of VAT refunds, the result could have a material adverse effect on future operations.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,491813,public,self,Long on HOLI,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f390p3/long_on_holi/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

In the beginning of 2020 i sold 60% of all my holdings because i believe we will either have a correction or recession occur in the upcoming 2 years due to the economy, politics and various reasons and the more i read about the market i get a feeling we are in a major bubble that's about to pop any time soon.. I'm not confident enough to sell 100%, i could be wrong and that's why i keep 40% invested.

However i'm sitting here thinking why the market is continuing to climb meanwhile hundreds of companies are loosing money due to the Corona Virus, I myself work for a car company that has factories in China which are currently on a production pause, this will obviously effect the amount of cars we produce and will result in a money loss. Almost every business in China is on pause and this will effect hundreds of big companies around the world because many big companies have productions in China due to cheap labor.

This also effect the surroundings because when China stands still we can't ship our car parts to China, therefore we get limited space because of overflow and it's basically a small crisis.

I believe when companies releases their first Q1 reports the stock market will plunge and the cause will be because of the Corona Virus but people may question why hundreds of companies has had a bad Q1 report, what do they have in common, maybe they'll think people have stopped consuming as much or who knows. I don't think people realize what an impact this virus will have but i'm excited to see what happens after all the Q1 reports.

Now, with production of the **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA))  Model 3 in full swing, including at its new China plant, and with the  company's Model Y and Cybertruck truck in development stages, Musk has  defied skeptics once again.  
  Tesla stock has surged to record highs over the past nine weeks,  reaching a market valuation above $100 billion for the first time, on  Jan. 22. Tesla is up more than 208% since Oct. 23, the day before it  jumped more than 17% on an [earnings-fueled gap up](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-earnings-jump-third-quarter-profit/).

 Among recent catalysts for Tesla stock: Billionaire investor Ron Baron said he believes the company has the potential to hit [$1 trillion in revenue in 10 years](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-continues-climb-on-positive-comments/). In addition, [Baillie Gifford &amp; Co](https://fintel.io/soh/us/tsla/baillie-gifford-), Tesla's top shareholder outside of CEO Musk, disclosed that it's raised its stake to 7.67% from 7.46%.

But it's behind Japan's **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), which has a market cap of about $198 billion.

Most know that BIIB saw a nice win and large uptick last week. Also that they have some major down and up swings when they pulled their Alzheimer drug trials and then decided to try and resubmit. Stating the obvious if they submit and get approval it will skyrocket and will plummet if it is rejected again. 

My question is based on the news and stock with the potential announcement they have resubmitted for approval. Do you think this is baked into the announcement they were going to submit, or will it see a slight uptick when/if they announce since some are still questioning if they will resubmit?

I have a call option for Sept that has some nice profits. Was going to sell however wasnt sure if there will be another uptick when/if they announce resubmission. I wish I sold at the massive drive up the day of but I was in meetings all day when the news broke and it settled way down by time I saw EOD.

Pharmacyte Biotech.  I have been invested and monitoring them for about 9 years now.  It’s a penny stock but they’ve done everything right to finally be able to present an IND package (Investigational New Drug) to the US FDA.

The stock price is only .05 as it is (IMO) heavily manipulated.

For a nickel you can get a share of a company with a brilliant technology platform (Cell-In-A-Box) that’s a few months away from the clinic.

I’m not advertising or advising anyone to buy, but 15 minutes of due diligence on this small company and you’re likely to conclude the same thing I did years ago:  their patented technology (CIAB) has tremendous potential to improve the way cancer is treated.

* After a decline that took the major averages well off their Tuesday session highs, U.S. stock futures point to a strong Wednesday open as investors become slightly less concerned about the coronavirus. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq did manage to eke out record closes Tuesday despite the fall from their highs, and both are up in six of the past seven sessions. (CNBC)
* On today’s economic calendar, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be back on Capitol Hill today, this time before the Senate Banking Committee in the second day of his semi-annual testimony on monetary policy. The Mortgage Bankers Association is out with its weekly report on mortgage applications at 10 a.m. ET, while the Energy Department releases its usual Wednesday look at oil inventories at 10:30 a.m. ET. (CNBC)
* Bitcoin hits highest price this year, above $10,000 as Powell discusses cryptocurrencies (CNBC)
* Powell says Fed ‘closely monitoring’ coronavirus for hit to China and the world (CNBC)
* Earnings reports out before the opening bell include CVS Health (CVS), Molson Coors (TAP), Moody’s (MCO), and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). After-the-bell reports will come today from Altice US (ATUS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Equifax (EFX), International Flavors (IFF), Marathon Oil (MRO), MGM Resorts (MGM), Redfin (RDFN), and TripAdvisor (TRIP).
* Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) were losing about a quarter of their value in the premarket after the home goods retailer said same-store sales were down a greater-than-expected 5.4% in December and January. The company blamed increased promotional pricing, lower store traffic and issues with inventory management. (Reuters)
* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) were down over 4% in the premarket despite a strong fourth-quarter report. The company’s earnings beat estimates on revenue and active riders and a lower-than-expected loss per share. However, Lyft did not give an update on its profitability timeline as its competitor Uber (UBER) did during its earnings report last week. (CNBC)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders will win New Hampshire’s Democratic primary, NBC News projected, setting him up near the top of a fractured presidential field. The Vermont senator will edge out former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will come in third. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former VP Joe Biden were vying for fourth place as results came in. (CNBC)
* Joe Biden’s donors are divided on his 2020 prospects after New Hampshire, Iowa flops (CNBC)
* Amy Klobuchar’s campaign gets a boost as Biden and Warren fizzle in New Hampshire (CNBC)
* Presidential candidate Andrew Yang dropped out of the 2020 Democratic race after finishing well behind top-tier candidates in the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Sen. Michael Bennet also dropped out of the race as results started rolling in. (CNBC)
* The flu-like coronavirus that has sickened more than 44,500 people in over two dozen countries now has a name: COVID-19. The new virus that emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, likely originated in bats and then jumped to an “intermediate host” before infecting humans, World Health Organization officials said. (CNBC)
* The coronavirus appears to be sparing one group of people: Kids (CNBC)
* CDC says ‘mix-up’ led to early release of coronavirus patient in California (CNBC)
* Nissan filed a civil lawsuit against former Chairman Carlos Ghosn today, seeking an initial amount of $90 million. The claimed damages are linked to Ghosn’s “breach of fiduciary duty as a company director and his misappropriation of Nissan’s resources and assets,” the Japanese automaker said in a statement. (CNBC)
Airbnb reportedly lost money last year as costs outpaced revenue, casting doubt on the company’s private valuation and the timing of its planned public debut this year. The home-sharing start-up reportedly lost $322 million over the first nine months of last year.
* Google (GOOGL) today will seek to overturn the first of three hefty EU antitrust fines at Europe’s second-highest court in a landmark case that could determine how EU enforcers take on U.S. tech giants for abuse of market power. In the U.S., the FTC said it will examine prior acquisitions by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. (Reuters &amp; CNBC)

New York(CNN Business) Fixing the 737 Max and getting it back in the air is crucial for Boeing. But it's not the only major challenge facing the embattled aircraft maker. Boeing also needs to focus on its next generation of passenger planes.

The aircraft maker has made its focus clear as it works on getting the 737 Max approved to fly again, which is expected to happen by the middle of this year. The plane has been grounded since March, following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. The nearly year-long crisis has put orders and deliveries of many of the company's jets on hold.

Tuesday, Boeing reported that it didn't receive any new orders for commercial jets in January, compared to 45 orders a year ago.

First time poster here; I'll get straight to the point.

I played a bounce in BBBY yesterday with an average price of $14.25 and a stop loss at $14.15. During market hours, it ended up bouncing and closed up around 4%. Good. I was happy, and I thought it could rise more tomorrow before I eventually close the position for a quick swing.

However, after-hours, their CEO decided to drop a bombshell. Doesn't matter the news; something about a earnings warning of sales down 5%. The stock immediately dropped 16%. I was deterred, kicked myself, and vowed to not enter long positions in shitty companies in the future (not sure if profanity is allowed on this sub. Hope I didn't break the rules). Even though I knew my stop loss wouldn't trigger AH, I wasn't panicking. The plan was to just manually exit the position AH and move on. 

When I tried to sell AH at a loss, it said I couldn't do so because I have an open order on the position. Duh, the stop loss! So I went and tried to cancel the stop loss order, but instead of cancelling the order, it told me the order cancellation was pending. What?? When does a freaking order cancellation pend? So I sit there refreshing for 5 minutes; 10 minutes; 15 minutes; all the while watching the stock price go further and further down and unable to do anything about it. I called their support team, and they told me the team responsible for cancelling those order went home at 4 pm. So they have people manually cancel stop loss orders??? This can't be a best practice.

As a result, when I wanted to exit at around $12.25 a share at 4:30 pm EST, I now have to wait until tomorrow morning. As of 5:30 pm EST, the price per share is now $11.25. I lost another 10% or so because of what I view as inadequacy from the broker.

So now, my question is, is this all legal?? Can they hold my position for ransom like that?? If I'm SOL, then let me at least share the broker with you: Ally Invest. Don't work with them. They're trash.

PS, I know they're not a good broker to use in the first place. When I first started trading, I used Tradeking, and I just never bothered to take my money out.

I trade (CFD only!) indices (futures) and sometimes US big ticket stocks. I cannot for the life of me find a decent Apple Watch app which shows me reliable prices for the aforementioned instruments.

I can use the in-built ‘Stocks’ app for my US company ventures; but when it comes to futures prices I am floundering.

I think SPCE is cool af and in the future IF they manage to actually make commercial space flights they'll become rich af along with long time shareholders.

Once they start making flights they'll make more spaceships, the more spaceships they build the more revenue and more stonks.
Also improving their technology could make it that they can fly more people in one spaceship thus lowering the ticket price and opening to a broader market.

The bet is in if their scientific part of being able to fly in space goes well  and also in all the burocracy that is needed to get approved.

I think that this stock is to be held long term and will take some years to blossom(like 5 years for space flights to become a ""common thing"").

This stock is either going literally to the moon or underground but that shit is cool af so I'm willing to bet on it.

I am currently investing small amounts every month into Stocks. I do that next to my ETF careplan for retirement.
There are some companies that could go up, due to good news. I try to spread my invest in cheap Stocks, but IMO promissing. 
21P had some bad news, cuz boss retired. But someone else has come aboard and I bet there could be potential. Maybe not tomorrow, but in maybe 1-3 years. I am optimistic, that all other states and maybe more european nations might legalize medical weed. I know there are some other players in that market, but some of them are over Budget. 
NEL sounds promissing too for me. Gov in EU and US invests billions of $ into hydrogen fueled solutions. Recently Nikola Motors started a Partnership with IVECO. A Truck manufacturer. I wait until September until Nikola Motors presents the Badger. Hopefully they will talk about refueling.

Like the market price is $15:30, then suddenly it spikes down to $15 then back to like maybe $15:27 or $15:33 
or $15:30 anyway you get the idea

So I placed a buy limit order order at maybe like 15.06 at like maybe 7am then it spiked down to $15:00 at 8am, my order wasn’t filled even thought the price already surpassed that point($15:06)

Note; numbers are made up, I was in a similar situation tho

Both price and time priorities has been reached I would say.

So I think it’s not typical sell order or something like that brings the prices plummeting for a minute in the extended hours.

DEAC currently trades at ~$17 a share with 40M shares outstanding for a market cap of ~$680M (confirmed by online listing under the ticker, not just my calculations).


There are articles stating the new merged company will be valued at around $3.3B (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-draftkings-diamond-eagle-idUSKBN1YR19F).


And since the stock is not undergoing a new IPO, I'm assuming the number of shares is unchanged (maybe this assumption is my mistake?).


Because with that logic, the new share price would be around $3.3B market cap divided by 40M shares outstanding, which equals ~$82.50


Obviously that's not what will happen, otherwise the DEAC price would already have moved up significantly. So, what does happen to stock price when a company merges and remains under the same traded stock? Does the fact that the merged company will reincorporate in Nevada have anything to do with that?",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,489916,public,self,Post-Merger Valuation,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f2aqgx/postmerger_valuation/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'n7O4oQx9m4dEUpw7Q0MtSJd1jnBVrXopqAX-Jc4ykCs', 'resolutions': [{'height': 71, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2Ucd1IxnV_qGIsmP4KL1SsJaM17sP4lZlxQja-3RAN8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b82b4f8196cb6fec195dfb1ef135e890f5d55f', 'width': 108}, {'height': 143, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2Ucd1IxnV_qGIsmP4KL1SsJaM17sP4lZlxQja-3RAN8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ae303e55f1b6a7a2a8d0d261821256a269f4990', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2Ucd1IxnV_qGIsmP4KL1SsJaM17sP4lZlxQja-3RAN8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba4bdb8cae99db191b75670cfcb54927e9cbba4', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2Ucd1IxnV_qGIsmP4KL1SsJaM17sP4lZlxQja-3RAN8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=958956ef616dc9e737861949d790e28c91847068', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 533, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2Ucd1IxnV_qGIsmP4KL1SsJaM17sP4lZlxQja-3RAN8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4a0818c68ce629185035c2574325adc445acaf0f', 'width': 800}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,

As I’m living in japan investing in US stocks, I don’t have access to apps that breakdown your portfolio and I thought it would be a good idea to tally up all my positions into percentages. Let me know what you think.

ABBV 5%
CSCO 20%
UBER 35%
VIG 12%
CCL 15%
MO 11%
The rest is cash and some in NIO 

Overall I’m going for a dividend growth portfolio mainly, with a few growth plays. I’m not happy with some of the above percentages - eg UBER is too big of a position so I’m stopping there and looking for others to add to the portfolio. Ideally I’d like no position to be more than 10%.

That’s probably too much back story to the actual question, but if you were to start a portfolio from scratch now what stocks would you be most interested in in the initial building of the portfolio?

I do feel I need to now get into some FANG stocks as I think I’m missing out there. Aside from that I’m not sure, so many to choose from, but in what order and what looks the most attractive, that’s a difficult question!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

A little bit about myself is that I am a finance student and an active investor in the stock market; with finance also comes some **knowledge of understanding accounting.** I got bored today and have been reading a lot of posts on reddit and found that there is not many in-depth attempts on fundamental analysis other than vague discussion on certain sectors and their potential for the future.

But maybe that's because people don't know enough regarding fundamental analysis itself and/or don't have enough time to learn it?

Fundamental analysis is not only observations on the sector and what the company has done/wants to do, but its also **how well-equipped is the company able to achieve not only its own expectations, but Wall Street's expectations? How has the company performed in the past quarters and how will they LIKELY perform in the following quarter(s)?**

Large dips in the stock price from prior months obviously signify a lacking investor sentiment, but practicing actually going over what made the stock drop will make you a better investor. Don't just read the articles! Go to the earnings report and/or the conference call, did they report less revenue than expected? Did they not beat EPS? Did they cut their outlook?

There is a lot of information that many people do not know in terms of reading financial statements and one glance at it can often turn people away since they can be somewhat difficult to read.

**So I thought that I would make a short, little mini-guide and provide some general tips and info on how to read them and what to look for!**

* **Pick a company and follow along with the post!(If you're a business mjr student, you probably already know all this)**

First, Look At The Balance Sheet.

This is usually the deal-breakers for many potential investors.Covering all of the balances will take too long, so I'll go over some basic and important ones

**ASSETS:**

* Consider how much on-hand cash do they have (Cash and cash equivalents)
* Accounts receivables? (Money that they are expecting to come in sometime soon)
* Inventories (value of their merchandise)
* Goodwill (this arises when companies acquire another company and its the value of their **intangible** assets, think of patents, the value of the brand name, etc)
* Intangible assets (patents, trademarks, etc, they are all essentially non-physical assets to the company)

I don't generally consider/look at (gross property, plant) but these include land, buildings and equipment etc; they decrease in value per year but again I would not really stress these over too much.

**LIABILITIES:**

LIABILITIES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANTAgain, I'll cover some basic important balances:

* Accounts payable (short term dues that need to be paid off to vendors/creditors)
* Accrued liabilities (similar to accounts payable, these are expenses that need to be paid off but have not been officially logged)
* Long Term debt (debts that are not owed within the next 12 months, can include long-term loans, bonds, notes, etc.)
* Deferred revenue (this is revenue that the company receives in advance from customers or other companies, but the service itself has not yet been provided)

**COMPARE HOW MUCH LIABILITIES THEY HAVE COMPARED TO THE ASSETS**In many articles, the amount of liabilities and debt that they have are often discussed, this was and is ESPECIALLY important with the emergence of Canadian marijuana companies last year; look at ACB (they're drowning in debt with not much cash).

**Check if they are paying off their debt or are incurring more.**

If you are looking at banks and credit card companies (AXP, Visa, etc.) looking at **doubtful accounts** or **bad debts expense** is especially helpful, but you can check it for any company; these essentially show the amount the company lost to customers unable to pay their dues; these can be potentially dangerous if their customers have a worrying history of being unable to pay.

Income Statement.

This covers the revenues and expenses of the company and their net income! A lot of the general ones are self-explanatory so I'll cover the main ones

* Total Revenue (Revenue without the costs)
* Cost of Revenue (can also be referred to as ""cost of goods sold,"" how much money it took to generate said profit. Example: The box sold for $5 but it costed $3 to acquire/produce)
* Gross Profit (Total revenue-Cost of Revenue. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM NET INCOME!)
* Operating Income (This is income after operational expenses)
* Net income (the difference between this and operating income is that it weighs in factors such as interest expense, income taxes, etc. THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE PROFIT AFTER EVERYTHANG)

Of course there are many balances of expenses but they are self-explanatory as you look at them.

Observe the net income, is it positive or negative? Is it rising or falling?If the company is not yet profitable, potentially **how close** is it to profitability?

Unprofitable companies should not necessarily be written off just for the sake of being unprofitable, just look at what happened with Tesla; you can also say the same with Uber and how they now forecast profitability by the end of this year- there is lots of renewed interest in the company despite being unprofitable.

Risk Factors

These are located in the 10k financials and also quarterly earnings financials (I am unsure if the 10k has more cited risk factors). **Not only do they show the risk and potential problems the company may face but reading them can also give you some insight on how the industry works and whether or not it is seasonal.**

Example: Risk factor for Yeti- They have mainly two manufacturers. These two manufacturers produce over 80% of all their products.

We can conclude that if one of these manufacturers were to run into some problems then the supply chain would be drastically affected.

Management

Lastly, we have management whom of which is crucial for steering the direction the companies are moving in. For this, you have some options, you can either look up the upper management's backgrounds online or you could go to the **proxy statemen**t.

The proxy statement shows the amount of stock the CEO and the other senior officers have as well as their backgrounds/experience; a CEO that is strapped to their company through equity/stocks/options is good in that they have plenty to lose if the company doesn't do well, this will give them more incentive to perform well.

**FIN**

That is pretty much all I have, I was considering whether to cover calculations for EPS, PE ratio, stock dividends, market cap, ROA (return on asset/investment) etc. but I feel that this post is already dense and I dunno if people will actually find it helpful so I'll end it there. Obviously, there is waaaaaaaay more to cover but if this helps at least one person, then coolio!

To keep this post a reasonable length I will link to a pdf hosted on Adobe's document cloud. [Link to full valuation in pdf format here!](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Ae4edb1a1-16a2-4e6a-a52b-b4a105a981c7) (If you want to skip the explanation of the inputs the story behind the numbers is located on pages 8-9 and the DCF model is located on page 10).

For the past year Apple has been on a massive run with seemingly no sign of stopping. Analysts have been upping their price targets and managers who have missed out on the run are piling in. With Apple recently reporting earnings, there has been renewed debate about what price investors should be paying for stock in Apple. Many say that the company is expensive and point to relative valuation measures such as P/E that are above their long term averages. Others say the company is inexpensive and point to growing revenue segments such as wearables and services.

My preferred method of valuing companies is intrinsic valuation, and what I present here is an intrinsic valuation assessing the value of equity in Apple using a DCF model. I am hoping to start a discussion about what others believe that Apple stock is worth, as well as what assumptions I have made that others agree or disagree with.

I present a base case, bull case, and bear case for Apple and what each of those scenarios would potentially look like. If I was an analyst I would give the stock a buy rating and place the fair value range of Apple stock between $350 and $400. This is NOT a price target and is based on the assumptions which are outlined in the paper.

Please leave any questions, comments, feedback, and discussion down below. I thoroughly enjoy talking about companies, the stock market, economics, etc.

So, I want to give an example. This isn't the exact numbers, it's just to show the idea;

According to Apple's latest annual report, as of September 28 2019, the company had approx. 137,000 full-time employees.  
And Apple, as of September 28 2019, had a market cap of about 1 trillion(not really, but let's just suppose it was)   
1,000,000,000,000/137,000 = This would make Apple's *value per employee* about 7,3 million.  
For Microsoft it would be around 1,100,000,000,000/148,000 = 7,46 million.

Prices have jumped so high recently that it has rattled a lot of the market’s most seasoned analysts and even regular traders and investors.

First Glance

At first glance, this looks like a classic case ofm [spring loading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spring_loading.asp) earnings.Their CFO, General Counsel, and Chief Human Resource Officer, all received stock grants on [February 2nd](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=0001517175&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) this year instead of March (or May as is the case of last year), when they typically receive their grants.

\*Can’t post images, so linking to tables. See grant dates table [here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1044/1*TzceYWWv3NaDgKVfWKM8Tw.png). See article with images [here](https://medium.com/spring-loading/is-the-chefs-warehouse-chef-spring-loading-q1-earnings-f298643879bf).

You will also notice that their grants always came *after* their Q4 earnings calls for those years (as it should). Then, all of a sudden, they granted the stock before earnings this year.

[Table image](https://miro.medium.com/max/866/1*luvgT6_47GKXfcLXd6_cUQ.png)

There is also some other interesting news that has happened over the last 6 months (thanks to [landhag69](https://www.reddit.com/user/landhag69) — nice name lol — on Reddit for pointing me towards some of this info).

* In November, they [raised $145 million](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/22/1951614/0/en/The-Chefs-Warehouse-Announces-Closing-of-1-875-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering.html). That money was used to buy [Sid Wainer and Son](http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-acquires-sid-wainer-son) (a curator and distributor of specialty food) on January 27th and [Cambridge Packing Company](http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-acquires-cambridge-packing-company) on February 3rd (the same day they reported their executive stock grants — though I don’t believe they were spring loading this announcement because that is just too close together). \* The stock is up 6.5% since February 3rd
* In November, Blackrock [announced](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2821864&amp;headline=CHEF-BlackRock-reports--passive-stake-in-Chefs-Warehouse) a 12.4% passive stake in $CHEF (which they just released an [update](https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form++SC+13GA+++Chefs%26apos%3B+Warehouse%2C+Inc.+++++++++++++++Filed+by%3A+BlackRock+Inc./16412042.html) two days ago stating that this was actually a 12.9% stake)
* On January 15th, Conestoga Capital [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163744/000108514620000197/chef_11520.htm) a 7.1% stake in $CHEF.
* They also released FY2020 guidance (\*remove SeekingAlpha link) on January 14th which the market seemed to like (+1%).

The acquisitions of the two companies as well as the large investments by Conestoga and Blackrock suggest that there may be optimism surrounding the company. However, since this is already public news, it could already be baked into the stock price (and the 6.5% gain we have seen over the last week). 

So apparently, the reason these grants were awarded is that they completed “ we find that this may all be easily explained.

Deeper Look

As we dive into the [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517175/000094787120000088/xslF345X03/ownership.xml), we see that the grants awarded were a result of “*shares delivered in connection with the vesting of performance-based restricted common stock award granted in 2017 pursuant to The Chefs’ Warehouse 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan based upon achievement of certain performance targets that were certified on February 3, 2020*"". The gist of the plan seems to be that they set aside 1.5 million shares (which at some point was increased to [1.75 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517175/000151717519000003/chef-12282018x10k.htm) shares) to grant to executives and employees based on their performance. ***\*If anyone has more info on the plan. Please share!***

So apparently, the reason these grants were awarded is because they completed “*certain*” performance goals for a chunk of stock that was awarded in 2017. However, looking through the awards given out in 2017, I cannot find what this performance achievement was to make any decisions on whether or not this bodes well for upcoming earnings. If anyone finds anything, leave a comment!

**Conclusion**

What starts out as a classic case of spring loading seems to transition into an easily explained case of employees hitting their performance goals. The only problem left is that we can’t figure out what goal they hit. If anyone finds the answer, please leave a comment with it! With that being said, the employees hitting their performance goal could be a good sign, but since we don’t know what that goal is, that is an incredibly murky position to take.

There are also quite a few more reasons why this isn’t a super strong case for spring loading:

* They had a decent 2019 (+13%) and just received some large investments, so they don’t seem like an obvious acquisition target
* There have been no big stock purchases made on the open market recently by any of the executives
* Only 3 of the 6 executives received a stock grant. Two of the executives that didn’t receive a grant are Chris and John Pappas, the co-founders of Chefs’ Warehouse. The other was the Chief Accounting Officer. The easy explanation here seems to be that neither Chris nor John received grants in 2017 (which is what just vested) and the Accounting Officer was not yet an executive in 2017!

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, February 10th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/futures-steady-trump-new-budget-and-coronavirus-deaths-exceed-sars.html)

* With coronavirus concerns still very much in the mix, U.S. stock futures point to more losses for Wall Street following a Friday sell-off. The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq’s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February’s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high. (CNBC)
* The Trump administration will release its fiscal 2021 budget today, which will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years. It’s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump’s promised “Tax Cuts 2.0.” (CNBC)
* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump’s 2021 budget (CNBC)
* No economic releases are on today’s calendar. Two Fed officials have public speaking engagements today, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman making a morning appearance in Florida and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker speaking this afternoon in Delaware. (CNBC)
* Allergan (AGN), Edgewell Personal Care (EPC), and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) are among the companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning. Callaway Golf (ELY) and XPO Logistics (XPO) issue numbers after the closing bell.
* Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 9% in the premarket this morning after a tumultuous week, which saw the stock move more than $100 per share in either direction in three of five sessions. Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)
* China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country. The U.K. has confirmed four further cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight. (CNBC)
* Factories in China remain shuttered as some regions extend shutdowns (CNBC)
* As virus deaths top SARS, survivor tells of treatment (WSJ)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders remains at the top of the Democratic field in a new NBC News/Marist poll of tomorrow’s New Hampshire primary. Sanders gets 25% of likely Democratic primary voters in the poll, while former Mayor Pete Buttigieg receives support from 21%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, comes in at 13%. (CNBC)
* Biden predicts he will ‘take a hit’ in New Hampshire primary after ‘gut punch’ in Iowa (CNBC)
* Mike Bloomberg is the only Democrat to top Trump in Gallup poll of small business owners (CNBC)
* The Iowa Democratic Party allocated delegates based on the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses, giving Buttigieg the largest delegate count, followed closely by Sanders, though many news outlets remained unable to declare a winner. Sanders’ campaign plans to ask for a “partial recanvass” of the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses. (NBC News &amp; AP)
* Sen. Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr’s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)
* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)
* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria’s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It’s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he’s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. (CNBC)
* The federally appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico’s ongoing record debt restructuring saga announced they have come to terms with bondholders of around $35 billion, which accounts for nearly 50% of the bankrupt island’s total debt load. The deal will cut the Commonwealth’s outstanding bond debt from $35 billion to approximately $11 billion. (CNBC)

&gt; **Restaurant Brands (QSR)** – The restaurant operator reported quarterly profit of 75 cents per share, 2 cents a share above estimates. Revenue also came in above forecasts. Comparable sales were shy of expectations at Tim Hortons and Burger King, but well above forecasts at Popeyes. The company said systemwide sales at the Popeyes chain jumped 42%, thanks in large part to its popular spicy chicken sandwich.

Market: Targeting people that have never worked out but want to start which is a growing market as ppl become more health conscious. Leadership says they want to go after the 80% of Americans that don’t have a gym membership.

Value Prop: Insanely cheap memberships at $10-$20/month with free training and other amenities. I believe most PF’s are also 24 hours. I don’t think you can find provide better value to this market.

Financials: Revenue/earnings growth has been strong, and they’re doing right things with their cash.. investing in new locations, paying down debt and buying back shares. CEO has said they are getting great deals on new retail locations because of the dying big box stores.

To me PF is riding waves that are going to continue to grow 🌊 🌊

Founded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988.

With an average net return of 39.1% after fees.

The Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.

Since, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.

Now, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).

Medallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.

Notice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.

In 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%

**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.

That certainly beats inflation...

So, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?

**PART 1: The Early Stages**

Early on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.

Remember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!

“I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,” Simons said. “A pure system without humans interfering.”

Simons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information

Straus’ was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.

He became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.

Over time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.

In fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!

At the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.

The return in 2008 is a prime example of that.

Commodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.

The fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.

**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**

Now in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the ""best math department in the world"".

Therefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.

We are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.

RenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.

The strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).

Simons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.

In 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&amp;P 500 at an unusually low level.

This test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.

It had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.

Magerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.

Finally, the simulator’s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.

The resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman’s calculations.

Only then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....

**PART 3: Infrastructure**

Now I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.

Big data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.

The problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:

Building a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.

To then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.

RenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.

They have completely automated the process of signal discovery:

They don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.

RenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.

The data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.

The mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.

**CONCLUSION:**

**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**

**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,488569,public,self,The GOAT Hedge Fund: Renaissance Technologies,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f1o73u/the_goat_hedge_fund_renaissance_technologies/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I am comparing the mobile phone industry with battery powered autonomous cars and they seem similar. 

After the Iphone came out, all other phone developers scrambled to release their versions. With in a few years of Iphone being the big thing, they held  about 45% of the mobile phone industry, while android only made up 3%. The remaining bit was still controlled by various flip-phones and etc. (Numbers from 2009)  
Fast forward to present day 2020, IOS makes up only 25% and android holds 75% of the market which produced by many phone makers. 

Imagine that Tesla is the Iphone and all other automakers are android. Tesla has created a new idea of what a car should be like. It should run on battery and be self driving. They have a huge market share in this particular section of the auto industry, as well as the hype, and a lead on technology vs other makers. The exact same as apple when they made the iphone. 

In short, I believe: Tesla is Apple, other makers electric cars are Android, and the gas cars represent all the flip phones that will eventually be phased out.

Many other companies are already investing in making their own battery powered cars and automation systems. It will most likely take them years to catch up to Tesla, but I believe it will happen. Meanwhile, tesla will continue to grow. Countries have started passing legislation to restrict the sell of gas powered cars after certain dates which should increase the move to battery powered car production. 

As far as car automation it seems like a lot of companies are making their own. Teslas AutoPilot is opensource and I know OpenPilot is opensource as well, but commaai could put their finished product up for licensing to automakers. Sot it is possible in the near future cars will have very similar operating systems, similar to android OS being used on different makers phones. 

I've seen several articles mentioning how ford and gm and others are risky bets, and others saying to grab them up while its down. I just wanted to share some similarities and say not to rule out some stocks just yet; its just a game of catch up.

So by definition this means that the stock is  overbought. But with a RS of 3.50 doesn't that mean it still has  potential to still be in a bull momentum. RS would mean that it is  currently in a bull momentum with an average gain of $3.50 or is that  wrong? I might not be understanding the fundamentals of it but would  love some pointers.

I was also  wondering how many of these charts you make for your portfolio. Do you  just make them for 5 stocks that you are interested in or currently  trading or do you do it for lets say a 100 stocks you are watching.  Would it be a good idea to do these charts for a company that is what  most people consider a penny stock, ACB?

Mylan in an inter partes review (IPR) was challenging Biogen’s ‘514 patent, which covers the treatment of multiple sclerosis with 480mg dose of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the active ingredient of Tecfidera. The patent provides market exclusivity in the United States until 2028.

Per the statement from the PTAB, generic drugmaker Mylan failed to demonstrate that some claims were not patentable.

Though Mylan announced its intention to appeal against this decision, the favorable ruling raises hopes for Biogen’s chances of maintaining Tecfidera’s exclusivity until 2028. Tecfidera constituted 39% of the company’s total product revenues in 2019.

The news removes a short-term overhang from the company. Biogen also faces a generic litigation in a court case related to the same patent. The favorable ruling increases the chances of winning the court case.

Shares of Biogen have increased 7.8% in the past year versus the industry’s decrease of 0.1%.

Notably, in 2017, Biogen strengthened its patent position for Tecfidera through a settlement and licensing agreement with Danish biotech Forward Pharma A/S regarding the same patent. Per the settlement, Biogen agreed to pay $1.25 billion for buying the license to Forward Pharma’s intellectual property covering DMF.

Meanwhile, last week, Biogen delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2019 results. The company beat on both earnings and sales in the reported quarter.

Revenue growth in the quarter was principally driven by higher sales of its key MS drugs, continued global growth of its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Spinraza and expansion of its biosimilar business.

Notably, Tecfidera has been one of the top revenue drivers for Biogen over the years. The drug generated sales worth $4.4 billion in 2019, reflecting an increase of 4% year over year.

Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider

Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector include Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. XENE and Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. KALA, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Xenon Pharmaceuticals’ loss per share estimates have narrowed 12.04% for 2020 over the past 60 days. The stock has soared 85.7 % in the past year.

Kala Pharmaceuticals’ loss per share estimates have narrowed 0.9% for 2020 over the past 60 days.

My name is Robin, I’m the Director of Trading of an investment network group that specialize directly in crypto private sales such as ICO’s/IEO’s/STO’s and also some stocks!

Some background information for those interested:

Initially, the group started out as a few business associates lightly investing and trading into altcoins back in 2017. It didn’t take long for us to appreciate the potential of ICO’s at the time, more so with the group’s accredited investor status and large capital liquid. Subsequently, our focal point went from trading to investing into ICO private sales (fulfilling discrete ETH allocation amounts set for us). The pre-sale of ICX was our first investment which yielded over a 10X+ and ever since we’ve dedicated ourselves full-time. Along the way we’ve built a strong base with connections amid big names in the crypto space, opening up many doors for us.

We’re currently seeking like-minded individuals that we deem recruitment worthy. In return, we can negotiate investment on behalf of our deals and bonuses. Timezone is absolutely not an issue.

From my understanding:

*CALL DEBIT SPREADS*: are like being bullish on a stock and buying calls on it but also writing higher strike calls to get a discount, and in case you get assigned you just gain the difference between the two strikes thus capping your gains, if the stock doesn't hit ur long call strike you lose the call's money-short calls premium. Max gain is if the price goes higher than the short call, max loss if it stays under the long call strike.

*CALL CREDIT SPREADS*: you are bearish on a stock so you write calls on it but to cap the loss you buy higher strike calls, you earn the short call premium-the long call premium u paid. Max loss is if the price stays in between the two strikes because if it goes higher than the long call strike you offsett a part of the loss with the long call gains, max gain if it stays below the short call strike.

*PUT DEBIT SPREAD*: you are bearish on a stock and buy puts but also write puts on a lower strike to get a discount. 
Max loss is if the stock stays over the long put strike, max gain if the stock goes under the short put strike.

*PUT CREDIT SPREAD*: you are bullish on a stock so you write puts on it, but to cap the potential loss you also buy puts on a lower strike.
Max gain is if the stock stays higher than the short put strike, max loss is if it stays in between the two strikes for the same reason as above.

#------------------------------------------#
But also credit put spreads are more dangerous than credit call spreads because if you get assigned you are holding stock(that may go up offsetting a part of the loss but also go down more) while with call spreads you just realize a loss and that's it.



Are there any tips one should know about trading options?
Like when to close positions or unexpected events that may occur?

Sorry, I just posted a rather dumb question about dividends. My question was answered, so I'm posting a follow-up. 

Can someone explain to me how companies calculate their dividends? Specifically, I'm working with an ETF that pays a monthly dividend. I have money invested in JPMORGAN ULTRA SHORT INCOME ETF (JPST). Every month I receive about $0.1 per share. But I see that it can fluctuate. For example, this month was 0.08496 per share, but last month was 0.10995, and a few months ago, it went as high as 0.12043 per share.

[Graph: Tesla Stock and Sanders' Election Odds](http://www.quiverquant.com/static/images/SandersTSLA.png)

\&gt;Given that this is an election year, one metric which we are tracking is how correlated every stock's performance is with the election probability of each of the presidential candidates. The proxy we used for a candidate's chance at being elected president in 2020 is [PredictIt's prediction market](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election), which allows users to buy or sell contracts on a certain candidate winning the election. From those transactions, we can find a market-determined probability of any candidate winning the election. We can then calculate the correlation between the daily change in each candidate's probability of being the next president of the United States and a stock's daily price change.

\&gt;On daily data from June 2019 to December 2019, Tesla's stock price had a correlation coefficient of .557 with the probability of Bernie Sanders becoming president in 2021. This makes sense intuitively, given Sander's proposals to create a [nationwide electric-vehicle-charging infrastructure](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-electric-congress/u-s-house-democrats-want-to-create-nationwide-ev-charging-network-idUSKBN2001Z1) and [establish a grant program for the exchange of combustion vehicles for new electric cars](https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/green-new-deal/). The past two months of data have supported this trend, as Tesla stock's surge has been mimicked by Sanders' surge in polling.

\&gt;In fact, Tesla's drop on February 5th was almost perfectly pre-empted by the release of Iowa Caucus results on the evening of the 4th (after market hours) that showed Pete Buttigieg holding a lead over Sanders.

I realized, however, AAPL is 53% of my equity, so as a small term investor it may be better if I buy a bunch of smaller blue chip stocks as opposed to buying 1 large one. I'm thinking of selling AAPL tomorrow and use the money to instead buy Coke (KO), Visa (V) and AMD stock. I'm also thinking of selling my Planet Fitness and TERP stocks.

Problem is I feel like MSFT won't be performing this well over the next 30 years and I just wanna hear your thoughts. :),True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,487189,public,self,Is MSFT Better Than Most if not All Index Funds?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f0whc3/is_msft_better_than_most_if_not_all_index_funds/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

So I am a UK resident and want to get into stock trading. However I am finding it confusing trying to find a platform to trade on. 

When I look online, places like TD Ameritrade and Fidelity look like great options. However I don't know if it will be an issue as a UK trader using these American brokers. A lot of the UK platforms have high fees (I can't understand why thats the case, if US ones have low/fair fees). 

I am aware that I can open an account on TD Ameritrade and use it, and as a non us resident will be subject to various tax rates, and will have to fill out forms every 3 years for my tax status (I think).

What I want to know is, is it worth me opening an account with TD Ameritrade and go through the extra work with the forms, or is there a better option as a UK resident that could match the resources and trading fees that US Stockbrokers offer? (No I dont want to use Etoro, their fees seem unreasonable to me).

Any and all relative advice and guidance will be hugely appreciated

Webull honestly is just a middle ground IMO between the simplicity or Robinhood and the less simplistic Schwab. Don’t really like Webull and just wanted the free signup stocks and don’t really use it a lot. 

And of course Robinhood everyone on here knows about so I won’t get into that. But yeah just some stocks that are a little bit higher risks at lower volume on the simpler interface.

# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**
*****
&gt; The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed’s neutral stand on interest rates.
*****
&gt; Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus’ progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created — 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.
*****
&gt; “The data has been very positive, but it’s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn’t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week — Tesla.
*****
&gt; The electric car maker’s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.
*****
&gt; “I do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,” said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. “I really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it’s not as crazy as it was in 1999.”
*****
&gt; Maley said now that the stock has “washed out” on the upside, there’s likely more downside ahead.
*****
&gt; “Some of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that’s usually a sign of a top as well,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Brakes on growth
&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China’s economy.
*****
&gt; “Next week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,” he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.
*****
&gt; Thursday’s consumer price index and Friday’s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.
*****
&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing’s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.
*****
&gt; “I think there’s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,” said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. “Most of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.”
*****
&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.
*****
&gt; “With the strong jobs, I think it’s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,” said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. “They mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they’re thinking about that. That’s the main thing we’re looking for.”
*****
&gt; China’s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.
*****
&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; “If we’re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,” the economists wrote in a note. “We assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings Bonanza
&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market’s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.
*****
&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.
*****
&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.
*****
&gt; # Playing Politics
&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa’s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire’s primary Tuesday will also be important.
*****
&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,” said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. ”[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he’s more that could be a market negative development.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.

# Week Before Presidents’ Day Bullish since 1990

&gt; Page 100 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents’ Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.

# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020

&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.

&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg’s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December’s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December’s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market’s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.

&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. “Today’s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “But the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.”

&gt; The one slight blip in today’s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.

# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls

&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market’s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**

&gt; In the above charts, the market’s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market’s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.

&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January’s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.

# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally

&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February’s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.

# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?

&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?

&gt; There’s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; It isn’t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. “Yes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.”

# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus

&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.

&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.

&gt; This year’s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.

Has anyone thought about this or tried to quantify/project out the increase in users this year? 

The SP seems reasonable at $37. Perhaps a bit high. Market cap is at $33B. Reasonable P/E at 19. I think it has room to grow and maybe give a nice pop if numbers surprise in the following quarters.

After doing some research on the best options for holding and investing this money, I've gone ahead and opened an Roth IRA through my brokerage. It's worth mentioning that my financial goals are completely rooted in the long-term, as in I have no plans to tinker with these initial investments for AT LEAST 5-10 years. 

Thus far, my plan is to invest 80% of this money into ETF's and individual stocks such as: Microsoft (obvious reasons), Synopsys (will likely hold a monopoly on the data-chip industry as AI takes off), Visa (societal transition away from cash spending &amp; increasing online shopping transactions), Paypal (similar reasons for Visa + acquisition of direct payment services like Venmo), Disney (not as bullish, but I believe it has potential to grow substantially as the company continues to branch out internationally), and lastly, I'm interested in looking at investing in at least one marijuana stock (maybe CGC since it's tanking currently) because I believe the industry will explode in the next decade when it'll inevitably be legalized federally. 

In addition to these individual stocks, I'm interested in putting 30-40% of this 80% allocation into a couple ETF's, such as: VTI (20-30 year hold), VT (security against potential US market crashes), QTEC (although Tech sector could be volatile short-term, I believe tech companies will only continue to grow and dominate the market throughout my lifetime), VOO (may wait until the bubble pops before buying in), and QQQ.

In terms of the final 20%, I'm either going to put it into Bond ETF's or High Dividend ETF's. Although, I'm open to advice/suggestions on how to allocate that 20%.

Lastly, I just want to add some background info, because majority of these investment posts for people in their 20s always emphasize having some liquid cash sitting around so you can buy stocks when they're ""on sale"". Aside from the \~$4,500 I plan to invest now, I have another $3,000 set aside in my Roth for future purchases. Also, I want to make it clear that this money is only accessible to me if I invest it. That being said, while I want to make safe investments, I'm also open to some higher-risk options. 

Since I don't have any relationship with my parents, I've had to teach myself how the stock market works, financial responsibility, how to perform quality DD, etc. with very minimal guidance.

Currently trying to pick between these 2 and having done my own research wanted to throw it out to this sub to see what I’ve missed.

Coming at this pretty much purely from a cloud gaming view which will dominate gaming in the future.

AMD: Also in the CPU market and are making major in roads here, and will likely grow market share in years to come. Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu’s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so.

NVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably. Not sure what NVDA would then do in this space, especially since cloud gaming may dislodge their GPU sales in consumer devices.
