Most of my money are in mutual funds. 

I have 4 stocks that i bought a few months ago: GOOG, FB, AMZN and TSLA (call me a basic bitch if you want). Currently i have a decent profit on GOOG (+9.7%) and TSLA (7.8%), small profit on FB (2.4%) and a small loss on AMZN (1.8%).  Around 4% (so quite a lot) of the gain on most of those stocks are due to my country’s currency falling compared to the dollar. In local currency i’m actually down at FB for example. 

Right now the dollar is higher than ever. My country’s economy isn’t doing bad apparently and it is quite stable, but from what i’ve read the currency is getting lower because of «nervous investors who’s afraid of the Trump-China relations». I don’t know anything about currencies really but i don’t think it’s ever been a higher ratio compared to the Euro and the Dollar, so i don’t think the ratio will increase much more. 

I’m considering selling some of my stocks because i’m a bit afraid of a recession, and i’m wondering if i should sell now because the currency rate is so high. Could that be a valid reason to sell? I’ve watched quite a few stock lessons and videos to learn about the basics but i’ve never heard anyone talk about selling stocks because of currency rates really, so that’s why i’m wondering. 

On TipRanks, AMZN, FB and GOOG are still all strong buys though, and most sites still seem to have upside ratings, so that’s mostly what’s keeping me from selling at the moment, considering i don’t have enough knowledge to read balance sheets and stuff well yet. 

And which of the stocks are most recession proof? I’m thinking FB and GOOG, while TSLA is more of a spec stock and AMZN has a high PE so it’s probably not as safe as the two first.

Technical analysis &amp; commentary:

The S&amp;P 500 is setting up perfectly for a crash on Oct 31 when the U.K. hard Brexits. The chart shows a clean technical trend towards an inflection point on that day—a strange coincidence. Here is some (hopefully) simple (enough) analysis to help you understand the risk of this particular scenario.

Looking at the chart with a daily timeframe (Chart #1), the medium term trend for the market is making a megaphone pattern (dark green lines). It looks like this &lt; on the chart but is pointing to 10 p.m. on the chart instead of 9 p.m. This is a bearish trend that shows limited upside (top dark green line is flattish) with increasing volatility (cone of the megaphone is expanding) to the downside (bottom dark green line is steeper than top line).

The short term trend is making a flag pattern (light green lines). It looks like this &gt; on the chart but is pointing to 2 p.m. on the chart instead of 3 p.m. This is a bullish trend showing a series of higher highs and lower lows. The price has traded very neatly within these trends in the last few weeks.

The trends collide on Oct 4, at which point the price will break-out of one trend and confirm the other. As we count down to Brexit, I think the market will trade throughout Oct between 3000-3150, above the dark green top line and into the end of the light green flag pattern. But it will be a bull-trap. The reality of hard Brexit may be the catalyst that confirms the megaphone pattern.

This prediction is supported by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator (Chart #1; second graph with intertwined blue and orange lines). MACD on the daily timeframe is beneath zero, indicating downward momentum, but that momentum is becoming less negative (shown by the cyclical uptick towards zero).

The Relative Strength Index (third graph with purple line) is currently at 68 on the daily timeframe, short of the 80 mark which usually triggers selling. Both of these indicators suggest the market has one last little heave to give towards the 3150 level before it stalls and crashes.

Looking at the chart with the monthly timeframe (Chart #2), we see the correlation between the unemployment rate (orange line) and recessions. Weakening employment conditions are the final indicator before a crash as it shows recessionary effects have passed from manufacturing through the whole economy to workers and consumers. Historically, a 0.3%+ increase in the three month moving average (MA) of the unemployment rate (not shown in charts) has signalled a recession is imminent. The jobs number is reported the first Friday of every month. The unemployment 3m MA has ticked up in the last couple months and will likely reach 3.9%, the critical level (3.6% low plus 0.3%)...in Oct. The RSI and MACD on the monthly chart also look prime to turn negative. So the stars are aligning for Oct 31.

If the market crashes, there are no established technical price levels where we can expect support (shown by horizontal red lines on Chart #1; support is when there is more buying than selling, which drives the price up) until 2350, a level last reached in the Dec 2018 tremor that shook global markets. Interestingly, the megaphone pattern indicates the next low will be 2100 on Feb 14 2020; 2100 is the next technical price level with support. Below 2100 the next major support is 1800, which would represent a 40% decline from 3250, but losses could run deeper.

If this set up comes about, it represents a huge trading opportunity. I'd recommend at the money puts on the SPXL (3x leveraged S&amp;P) with 20-40 day expiry. If this all comes to pass, a safe entry price will be when the price crosses the 200 day moving average (blue line on Chart #1, first graph). By safe I mean relatively safe; trading options on a leveraged index is for professionals and requires proper due diligence.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,402508,public,self,[TA] S&amp;P 500 is showing a technically clean set-up for a major shorting opportunity at 3150 around Oct 31 hard Brexit,0,1567450745,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cydzhe/ta_sp_500_is_showing_a_technically_clean_setup/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'WHNFUWmWLQobVMhQ5-guwq0K684dIUHNmbx8iveXQ0g', 'resolutions': [{'height': 50, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hxjHLZ44kmHry8Ohmt0fMpFSGxO9SnKZTL0U1YOx6pc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b34939f1fb0472f85590322fd65cf5586d18fd7e', 'width': 108}, {'height': 100, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hxjHLZ44kmHry8Ohmt0fMpFSGxO9SnKZTL0U1YOx6pc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ae5f028a506ec0274114834fe7d89fb2c616f77', 'width': 216}, {'height': 149, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hxjHLZ44kmHry8Ohmt0fMpFSGxO9SnKZTL0U1YOx6pc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=445c7650c406541f6de222b6687c303d527fb8e1', 'width': 320}, {'height': 298, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hxjHLZ44kmHry8Ohmt0fMpFSGxO9SnKZTL0U1YOx6pc.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af149800211c3cfac578b5371fbf62d4ad7b7e4', 'width': 640}, {'height': 447, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hxjHLZ44kmHry8Ohmt0fMpFSGxO9SnKZTL0U1YOx6pc.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0998ed368b0f0ccd637ccaf113e10d534aa1f0e3', 'width': 960}, {'height': 503, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hxjHLZ44kmHry8Ohmt0fMpFSGxO9SnKZTL0U1YOx6pc.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b416854142201798bbfbc3390ceee14eaccd30aa', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1698, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hxjHLZ44kmHry8Ohmt0fMpFSGxO9SnKZTL0U1YOx6pc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a738f823979d7146de4019a2d53b54134f26f775', 'width': 3644}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

How often does Trade Ideas update their database regarding ticker information? Since I've realized the difference, about 50% of the ticker's float from TI differ when compared to Yahoo / Finviz.

# **Investors say goodbye to choppy August markets but September may be no better  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/investors-through-choppy-august-markets-but-september-may-be-no-better.html)**
*****
&gt; Stock market investors may be glad to see August go, but September might not be any better, unless there are some positive developments in the trade war.
*****
&gt; Markets enter September, anticipating a Federal Reserve rate cut mid-month and worrying the chilling in the global economy will reach the U.S. There appears to be no progress in the trade war between the U.S. and China, and investors are watching to see if it will begin to hit key data.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell about 2% for the month, its worst performance since May. August was a month of rising recession worries and trade headlines moved the market in both directions, starting with the Aug. 1 declaration by President Donald Trump that he would put tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods.
*****
&gt; “If history repeats itself we could see a selloff in September and then we have some sort of capitulation,” said Samuel Stovall, chief market strategist CFRA. “We’re in the midst of what I call a pullback. The line in the sand is really 2,800. If we break meaningfully through that we could end up having a sharp and swift decline.”
*****
&gt; The first week of September includes some important reports, including the August employment report on Friday and the ISM manufacturing survey on Tuesday. The auto industry releases monthly vehicle sales Wednesday. Investors will also be looking for news on whether face-to-face negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials can take place in September, as expected after the last round of talks.
*****
&gt; For the stock market, September is historically a worse month than August, in terms of losses. “If you thought August was bad, history says September can be worse because not only is it the month with the largest average decline, but is the only month to fall more frequently than it rises,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Since World War II, the average move for the S&amp;P for all months is a gain of 0.69%, but the average September move is negative 0.54%. The market has been down 55% of the time in September, making it the worst month of the year, but October, which is up 61% of the time, is a more volatile month with historically steeper losses.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will also be watching interest rates, which have been in a steep decline in August. In one month, the 30-year bond has lost 60 basis points, to a level under 2%. The widely watched yield curve, between the 2-year Treasury yield and the 10-year yield inverted. That is a recession warning and means the 10-year yield has gotten lower than the 2-year yield, or investors are demanding more yield for shorter term investments.
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching to see how the incoming data affects the bond market and most importantly, the Fed. The Fed meets Sept. 17 and 18, and it is expected to cut rates by a quarter point though some bond strategists say it could cut by a half percentage point if the economy softens or markets are highly volatile.
*****
&gt; Next week could provide some clues on future monetary policy with Chairman Jerome Powell set to speak next Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman is also set to speak Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. ET.
*****
&gt; “Without offering judgment on Powell’s performance heretofore, investors will be seeking clarity on if 2019 will mirror the 1990s (75 bp of aggregate rate cuts) or if the fallout from the trade war has done more damage to the global economy and therefore warrants even greater accommodation,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.
*****
&gt; Economists expect 155,000 jobs were added in August, down from 164,000 in July, according to Refinitiv. They expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7% and average hourly earnings to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said he is watching the ADP private sector payroll report Thursday, ahead of the government’s report Friday, since it includes details on small business hiring. The sector has shown weakness in the ADP data.
*****
&gt; “May and June showed declines. That was the only time since 2010 that ADP showed declines for small employers over the course of the recovery. July was really weak too,” he said. Tilley said it’s unclear why that sector of the job market is showing softening, but since it is the first time since the recovery, it bears watching.
*****
&gt; Tilley said job growth appears to be at its weakest of the cycle. The government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics recently revised its job data to show 501,000 fewer jobs from March 2018 to March 2019. Tilley said he looked at the adjustment by spreading the reductions over the period, and it shows job growth was reduced by 41,750 in each of those months.
*****
&gt; “It means job growth was never as strong in 2018 as we thought, and the slowness is of concern,” he said. “On the other hand, if total wages and total GDP are unchanged, then the slower job growth came with higher average wages and higher productivity than previously thought.”
*****
&gt; The strength of the labor market is key, since it’s been helping fuel the consumer, responsible for about two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “If you’re looking for the recovery to keep going, and if you’re looking at this to be pushing it and consumer spending, this would be a red flag,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he is also watching the ISM manufacturing survey, particularly after Markit PMI data, another series of manufacturing data, showed a contraction. ISM is expected at 51.4, up slightly from 51.2 last month. A reading above 50 shows expansion.

# Day after Labor Day Bullish for Small Caps

&gt; In the last 21 years, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have all registered average gains of exceeding 0.2% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last seven years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all declined on the day in 2017 and 2018. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.12%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 38.1% of the time with an average loss of 0.005%.

# Typical September Trading: Choppy Early Gains Fade Late

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d316c9fcecc63780352f570022c024/502fb4ed37d42dd3-a1/s500x750/c3d1c6969f2f4deb7ac0e36e54cd6643dc73f2ec.jpg))**

&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small-caps, measured by the Russell 1000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However, after mid-month gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

# Down Friday/Down Monday Levels Not Reclaimed Yet

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e4c044d3d67395aa8ed45109ab5394f/dacebc880c3c9347-ff/s500x750/d19682be7ae94930d29057dffb20f87f0af34de7.jpg))**

&gt; Technically speaking, the market has settled into a range between 2815 and 2945 on the S&amp;P 500. S&amp;P 2815 is a support level we have been tracking for some time now that sits at the intraday high back on November 7, 2018 where the market failed last fall before the 20% correction ran its course to the Christmas Eve low. The good news is the 2815 has held here this time unlike the ~2700 level last fall. 

&gt; The bad news or at least the technical case for no new highs is that the S&amp;P has yet to clear the 2945 level, which was the intraday high on Friday August 2 that was the beginning of two back-to-back Down Friday/Down Mondays, which has a negative indication if not quickly reclaimed.

&gt; Fund Flows Still Feeble

&gt; Below is an update of fund flows data from the Investment Company Institute including mutual funds and ETFs. In the tables below, we show dollar fund flows for total mutual funds plus ETFs along with ETFs alone. Obviously, mutual fund flows have been persistently negative for a long time now, but ETF flows are making up for that in many ways. The combined data only goes back to 2013, but over that period total ETF flows are in the 99th percentile for all ETFs...and that includes a string of drawdowns in domestic equity ETF flows over the last few weeks. Combined, ETF plus mutual fund flows are a better measure of total sentiment than mutual funds alone. While ETF fund inflows are only just off record highs, combined mutual fund and ETF fund flows are down across the past week, month, three months, and year for all equity funds, domestic only equity funds, and global equity funds. On the other hand, bond funds have seen the same torrid inflows that have been picked up in mutual fund flows for a long time now: since 2013, total bond inflows to ETFs are near the 97th percentile for all periods. For ETFs plus mutual funds, recent inflows are less dramatic but still very, very large; that’s especially true for the municipal bond space. We also note commodity funds have seen a pickup in net flows of late.

&gt; To provide further context, below we show rolling 13 week fund flows for the total equity space as well as domestic funds only. While ETFs have seen material inflows, combined mutual and ETF flows are still materially negative, with total equity mutual fund plus ETF flows at a record size.

&gt; B.I.G. Tips - Years Like 2019: August Edition

&gt; We’ve highlighted the chart below comparing 2019 to 1998 a number of times over the last several weeks, and the similarities between the performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year has continued right up through the end of August. While the pullback from the highs this Summer hasn’t been as severe as it was in 1998, the timing of both and the subsequent periods of backing and filling has been striking. A continuation of the similar patters certainly wouldn’t be a positive in the short term, but the silver lining is that Q4 1998 was exceptionally strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chartwebsite1998.png))**

&gt; As we do throughout the year, in our most recent B.I.G. Tips report we compared the S&amp;P 500's trading pattern this year to all other years in order to see which ones were the most similar. With those similar years, we then analyzed how the S&amp;P 500 performed for the remainder of the year in order to help come up with a framework for what to expect for the rest of this year. It shouldn't surprise anyone that 1998 made the list, but a number of other notable years also had strong similarities to the pattern of 1998 with very different outcomes as well.

&gt; Russell 2000 (IWM) Testing Support

&gt; Unlike large-cap major indices like the Dow or S&amp;P 500 which managed to reach record highs earlier this year, so far in 2019, the small-cap focused Russell 2000 never managed to so much as retest the highs from around this time last year. In fact, in the past year, other than the final leg down to December lows and the subsequent rally back up to previous levels in early 2019, the Russell has been in a range between support and resistance from last fall. This support and resistance can actually be traced back even further to the highs and lows of late 2017 and early 2018. This year has seen more tests of these support levels after May declines and once again this month.

&gt; At the beginning of August, the Russell collapsed through flat 50 and 200-DMAs finding relief at the bottom of this range. Since then, the index has been bouncing between this support and the 200-day with the most recent failed test of its 200-DMA coming just last week. Over the past few sessions, while it has not closed significantly below, intraday the index has breached these critical support levels. Fortunately, today the index is seeing some mean reversion from its extreme oversold levels as it is up rather than breaking out of the range to the downside.

# What's Driven the S&amp;P 500?

&gt; In last night's Closer, we showed the biggest contributors to the S&amp;P 500's gain so far in 2019 as well as the stocks that have weighed on the index the most. Given the S&amp;P's 14% YTD gain, it's probably not surprising to hear that only one stock in the entire S&amp;P 500 has weighed on the total index performance by at least 20 bps: Pfizer (PFE). On the other hand, 11 different stocks have added at least 20 bps to total index performance in 2019. We show the 10 best and worst-performing stocks this year by the overall contribution to the S&amp;P 500's performance in the table below. As shown, mega-cap Tech like Microsoft (MSFT) and four of the five FAANG names have been the biggest contributors. When you add them all up, they've accounted for roughly 26% of the S&amp;P's gain this year. Two credit card companies -- Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), and two retailers -- Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) -- have also been big contributors to gains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive1.png))**

&gt; At the industry group level, health care stocks related to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, and Life Sciences are one of only two industry groups to weigh on S&amp;P 500 performance this year. Energy is the other standout with a 4% decline. Software &amp; Services is the best performer, driving 3.3 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 14% gain this year. Media &amp; Entertainment, Retail which includes Amazon (AMZN), and tech Hardware are the only other groups that have added at least 1% to the total 14.46% gain for the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive2.png))**

&gt; While YTD numbers look really great, things are not so hot versus this time last year; the S&amp;P 500 is actually slightly lower year-over-year. As a result, the gap between the contribution of gainers and those of decliners is much narrower. Only four stocks drove a gain of at least 20 bps for the headline index over the past year: Microsoft (MSFT), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V).

&gt; We note that the top ten gainers are almost exclusively very blue-chip stocks: large tech companies, credit card networks, and some consumer names. Only the cell phone tower REIT American Tower (AMT) is unusual in this list of big-cap, well-known stocks. Losers are concentrated in Health Care, Banks, and Tech.

&gt; While Alphabet (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) aren't down drastically versus last summer, their market caps are big enough to have cost a lot of performance for the S&amp;P 500's overall performance. Smaller cap stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA), DuPont (DD), AbbVie (ABBV), and Schlumberger (SLB) are a verry different story.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive3.png))**

&gt; At the industry group level, there have been more decliners than gainers, though only Energy and Banks have cost the index more than 80 bps; on the flip side only Software has been a greater than 80 bps gainer. Defensive industry groups like Utilities, Household &amp; Personal Products, and Real Estate have all driven the S&amp;P 500 higher while cyclical industry groups like Capital Goods and Tech Hardware have weighed.

# This Isn't Normal

&gt; Being long bonds these days probably feels like being long tech stocks in the late 1990s. Every day you look at your portfolio, you expect it to be higher than the last time. This month through yesterday, the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index is up over 10% and that doesn't even include the rally we are seeing today. If the gains we have seen so far hold up into month-end, it will go down as just the 5th month since 1978 that long-term treasuries gained more than 10% in a single month. The last time we saw this large of a move in the long-term Treasury market was more than 10 years ago in November 2008, and before that you have to go all the way back to February 1986. In other words, this kind of move isn't normal.

&gt; Besides the fact that long-term Treasuries are up over 10% this month, August marks the fourth straight month of gains for the asset class, and while that may not sound like much, the last time we saw a streak of four or more months of gains was in January 2015. With all these gains, the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year Treasury Index is up over 22% YTD. 22%!

# Consumer Confidence Defies Pessimism

&gt; U.S. consumers are feeling especially empowered these days, despite growing pessimism about the economic outlook.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Consumer Confidence Pushes Through Trade Uncertainty, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell to 135.1 in August. Still, that’s the fifth-highest reading of the economic cycle, an impressive feat given trade tensions and other global headwinds.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zAlOT8M.jpg))**

&gt; August’s strong consumer confidence reading was driven by a 19-year high in consumers’ views of present economic conditions. That’s no surprise to us, as steady gains in wages and jobs typically support consumer spending. Fiscal stimulus implemented in 2018 provided an extra boost of income through lower tax rates and added tax credits, and lower oil prices have allowed consumers to allot more income to discretionary spending.

&gt; “Consumer spending has been one of the most encouraging trends in the economy lately, thanks to a solid U.S. labor market,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “It’s difficult to see a near-term economic downturn with such a strong undercurrent from the U.S. consumer.”

&gt; A U.S. economy carried by the consumer isn’t a bad situation to be in. After all, consumer spending accounts for about 70% of gross domestic product, so healthy consumer activity could carry the expansion on its own.

&gt; However, U.S. businesses need to transition into leadership at this point in the cycle. As we mentioned in Tuesday’s blog, capital expenditures (capex) need to rebound as the cycle matures to help sustain the expansion. Unfortunately, trade uncertainty has increasingly weighed on corporate sentiment, so a resurgence in capex may not be possible without a U.S.-China trade resolution.

Quote from an interview:

Q: What’s in your portfolio now?

A: One good stroke of good fortune was meeting Warren Buffett in 1968. It led me to realize that I needed to invest in Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.A), although I didn’t do it until 1982. It’s my single investment in the stock market. It’s like a broad value-stocks equity index. I hold it in lieu of VTSAX [the Vanguard Total Stock Market fund]. It does about as well with no current taxes to pay. VTSAX has dividends that are taxed annually. I also have some hedge funds, but I consider them not as good as Berkshire, so I use them to spend and finance other things I do.

If price was not random, it would be easy to build a trading strategy. Our struggle to tame arbitrariness is the source of all the abstract constructs we put around price.

Fundamental, technical, quantitative, factor analyses are endeavors to tame arbitrariness. 

Fundamental analysis is an endeavor at soothsaying tomorrow’s price by reading into today’s entrails.
Value is the construal we ascribe to valuation.

Technical analysis, categorically the predictive kind such as de Mark, Fibonacci, is an endeavor at bringing divine order to chaos.

Quantitative analysis is the predictably skeptical science of skepticality.

Factor analysis is an endeavor at reverse engineering yesterday’s soup into tomorrow’s menu.

None of those obediences preach acceptance of what is: the arbitrariness of price. They all believe that ineluctably they will be able to tame it, and in doing so, they are the architects of their own frangibility. Keep Christmas trees for December, chaos theory for weather forecast and fundamental bedtime stories for your children.

Underperformers have an external locus of control:

If price was not random, it would be easy to build a trading strategy. Our struggle to tame arbitrariness is the source of all the abstract constructs we put around price.

Fundamental, technical, quantitative, factor analyses are endeavors to tame arbitrariness. 

Fundamental analysis is an endeavor at soothsaying tomorrow’s price by reading into today’s entrails.
Value is the construal we ascribe to valuation.

Technical analysis, categorically the predictive kind such as de Mark, Fibonacci, is an endeavor at bringing divine order to chaos.

Quantitative analysis is the predictably skeptical science of skepticality.

Factor analysis is an endeavor at reverse engineering yesterday’s soup into tomorrow’s menu.

Most were projecting subjective illusions of a fantasy derived from acquisitiveness. My hypothesis was they'd be out on any pop, then claim how great their profits were.

Any allusion of impotency on the bid led the stock tumbling back down. Once the buyers feared the top was in, they became sellers. Actively look out to FALSIFY a hypothesis, rather than look out to corroborate it. The trade hypothesis's were scarcely falsified, leading to precise positions.

Hey all - here's a little something I wrote up to practice identifying potentially deceptive/manipulative accounting tactics. Hopefully it helps someone and hopefully you all have some thoughts on this as well since I'm certain there are things I'm not considering when writing this. I definitely don't know everything about Tesla or the subject matter in general, but I thought it was a good example of the practice:

## Identifying Earnings Management by Monitoring Revenue Recognition Policies

In the investing world, there's a concept known as [cookie jar accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cookiejaraccounting.asp). This is for all intents and purposes a friendly way of saying legal financial manipulation. Cookie jar accounting is not illegal, but it can be a troubling indicator if it's done chronically, and even in a singular instance it can indicate a potentially significant detriment to future cash flows and earnings. To that end, the intention of this post is not to take a positive or negative position on companies that employ cookie jar accounting or other earnings management tactics, but instead to educate and inform on how the process works and how it can be identified, potentially saving investors from unfavorable earnings surprises and allowing analysts to predict earnings more accurately.

In Q1 of 2018, our friends at Tesla, Inc ([TSLA](https://www.lazyfa.com/TSLA/dashboard/overview/)) updated a key revenue recognition policy:

&gt; We plan to adopt the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. This will impact the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners, **which now will qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return**. In addition, for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018, we will cease recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach. (page 41)

&gt; Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, **if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows**. (page 41)

&gt; The adoption of the ASUs **will accelerate the revenue recognition of certain vehicle sales** to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, which will therefore qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return as opposed to the current accounting as operating leases or collateralized lease borrowings. (page 80)

Source: [2017 TSLA 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459018002956/tsla-10k_20171231.htm)

This essentially indicated that Tesla planned to begin immediately recognizing revenue which would previously have been recognized over time, and trust that their leasing partners wouldn't exercise their right of return and dump the product back on Tesla, sticking them with a used asset that wasn't worth the revenue they recognized when they sold it and forcing them to adjust their earnings to account for the difference. Of course, because the customers in this case are leasing partners, the policy change was not as blatantly manipulative as something like [channel stuffing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/channelstuffing.asp), but it was certainly a gamble by Tesla management at the very least. Nevertheless, in Q3 2018 Tesla unsurprisingly announced a ""[truly historic quarter](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/725970e6-eda5-47ab-96e1-422d4045f799)"" with year over year GAAP revenue growth of nearly 130% to $6.82 billion and a ""surprise"" GAAP profit of $1.82/share. This in turn created a buying frenzy sending TSLA stock from just above $250 to nearly $400/share between October and December of 2018. Over the next six months though, Tesla stock bled away these gains in spectacular fashion, hitting lows below $180/share before finally beginning a small recovery. How could investors have seen this coming? How might you have saved yourself from buying Tesla at $375/share only to see it immediately shed more than 50% and decimate your portfolio?

## Enter the [Manipulation Monitor](https://www.lazyfa.com/TSLA/manipulation/overview/):

The first sign that something was amiss actually showed up *before* Tesla's ""historic quarter."" Almost immediately after the 2017 annual report, LazyFA's Manipulation Monitor identified large declines in both [unearned revenue as a percentage of sales](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_ur_pct_sales_decline.original.png) and [days unearned revenue](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_dur_halved.original.png). Obviously, this would lead to a decline in the actual [unearned revenue itself](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_new_revenue_recognition.original.png). This is Tesla with their ""[hands in the cookie jar](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_unearned_revenue_tapping.original.png)"", accelerating revenue recognition in accordance with the new revenue standard. And of course, depleting that unearned revenue would lead to the simultaneous ""increase"" in recognized revenue. This (partially, in fairness) explains the [huge year over year increase in sales in Q3 and Q4 of 2018](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_rev_growth.original.png).

As Tesla tapped their unearned revenue over the course of 2018, assets and liabilities related to the adoption of the new revenue standard were shifted around, resulting in a wonderful finish to the year showing operating cash flow of $2.10 billion, a staggering $2.16 billion increase from the previous year's cash outflow of $60 million. This type of [statistical outlier](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_ocf_outlier.original.png) is a clear red flag, and as such was easily identified by LazyFA's [Red Flag Analysis Engine](https://www.lazyfa.com/TSLA/redflags/overview/). Make no mistake though. Tesla was very clear about the source of these changes. All investors needed to do was read the 10-K:

&gt; This favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $1.60 billion and the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $554.6 million. The decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as a result of increased expenditures to support our ramp of Model 3 deliveries and a net decrease in operating lease vehicles and resale value guarantee liability primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue standard (page 65)

Source: [2018 TSLA 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459019003165/tsla-10k_20181231.htm)

Is it any surprise then, really, that the ""historic"" Q3 2018 and its Q4 successor were not sustainable? While there was certainly some healthy growth in production numbers and legitimate vehicle sales, these increases in revenue, operating cash flow, and earnings per share were largely driven by an accounting change that allowed Tesla to recognize revenue earlier than it normally would have been able to. Subsequently, soon after the announcement of Q3 2018 earnings, Tesla announced that they expected earnings to be much worse in the first half of 2019, which they were. Just look at the [complete 180 from the second half of 2018 to the first half of 2019](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_gp_ebit_ni_eps.original.png). 

The first half of 2019 was not unexpected for Tesla. It was a reversion to the mean ... a return to normalcy. Management almost certainly knew that this massive positive flip in earnings and cash flow wasn't sustainable, but tapping the cookie jar allowed them to provide the market with a little hope for the future. Being able to identify this type of accounting tactic ahead of time could have saved investors who bought into the hype following Q3 earnings from losing 50% of their investment. Tesla isn't alone in their quest to please Wall Street. Many companies employ these kinds of accounting tricks under pressure to meet analyst expectations and please the market at large. It's up to us as investors to read between the lines.

What do you think? What am I missing that would change my opinion? Obviously not the *entire* flip from negative to positive earnings for a couple quarters was due to accounting tricks. What's your take?

Many people know [r/weedstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/), but I was hoping to get a more unbiased opinion here. Stock like GTII (GTBIF:OTC) just reported earnings, and they were arguably very strong. They have a \~$1.7 billion US market cap, and just reported $44.7 million US revenue on their latest Q, an increase of 228% YoY and 60% QoQ. Gross margins improved to 52% from 46%, good balance sheet, and there was nothing said on the Conference call that would be interpreted as negative. (Earnings Report [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/28/1908014/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Triples-Revenue-to-44-7-Million-and-Reports-5-0-Million-in-Adjusted-Operating-EBITDA-in-Second-Quarter-2019.html) if you'd like to see the numbers).

Despite the good earnings, and their strong growth potential as more US states open up to Recreational use, the stock went down the day of earnings, and continues to fall today. Down about 65% from their all time high despite consistent QoQ growth and execution from strong management. The US market is expected to be $50+ billion by 2025, so there's definitely growth potential.

On [r/weedstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/) people say that the stocks are heavily manipulated on these exchanges like the CSE and OTC, and that's why even when they report good earnings, they go down. Now, you could argue they are all massively overvalued, but compared to the Canadian LP's, the US MSO's (Multi State Operators) are much better value, especially if you believe the US will eventually legalize on a federal level.

So my question is, are these stocks actually manipulated by aggressive short selling, or is it truly a question of valuation, and both US/Canadian MJ stocks are over valued?

That is to say, if a company has 1000 shares, is each one worth 0.1% of the companies assets in the case of liquidation?  

I understand there are many factors that make the market value of a share different. I am aware of two independent strata shares are classified by:

* Voting rights - variable control of decisions per share
* Preferred vs common- preferred gets priority payout &amp; fixed payouts (all I know right now)

In the case of a distribution, if the fixed payouts exceed the ""percent ownership"" of the preferred stock, they still get their money, common stock gets shafted on their percent ownership.  As far as I know this is the only thing that makes one share worth potentially more ""percent"" in some cases.  Correct me, but it does not seem voting rights have any relation to ""financial entitlement"", unless by choice of the issuer through coinciding higher voting rights on preferred stock

In a Perfect World™ Example:  there are 1000 shares issued.  The company has absolutely no debt to pay.

* Tom has 990 common non-voting shares
* Jerry has 10 ""preferred super voting luxury supreme class AAA"" shares

In the case of liquidation, is Tom entitled to 99% of the liquidated assets value if all fixed payout requirements entitled to Jerry are less than 1% of the total liquidation value?  If so, is this something ""fundamental"", or does it vary country to country, company to company, etc?  Additionally, I assume that in example Jerry had full control of the company while it was running.

""Tiziana ([TLSA](https://stock-watch.market/TLSA)) could have the first true platform to directly take on a drug that is doing over $20 billion is sales. Abbvie’s Humira is incredibly diverse and has become one of the biggest autoimmune blockbusters in recent biotechnology history. But one huge flaw has left the door wide open for Tiziana’s ([TLSA](https://stock-watch.market/TLSA)) lead therapies to capitalize.

In an autoimmune disease, the body’s immune system falsely detects and attacks a threat within the body that does not really exist. This can lead to a number of problems and conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease, and psoriasis.

Just like Tiziana’s Foralumab, Humira is a monoclonal antibody that targets symptoms related to autoimmune disorders. But here’s where the opportunity is: The only way to use Humira is intravenously via an injectable syringe or pen. Foralumab can be administered nasally or orally and this simple change in delivery method could set a stage for a strong argument supporting the potential of Tiziana’s (TLSA) platform.""

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

FB and GOOG had this playground all to themselves, now the field is widened to more entrants. Companies like The Tradedesk I suppose also operate on this space.

Tell me if I am right or wrong please. Let's say you have $10,000 you invest. You invest $6000 in stock A and $4000 in stock B. 

Throughout the year:

Stock A rises 20% making its total worth $7200. Gain of $1200.

Stock B falls 20% making it worth $3200. Loss of $800.

Within the same year you sell both stocks within days of each other. My question now is what would you have to pay taxes on. It would make sense that you would only have to pay taxes on $1200-$800= $400 because this is what you actually profited, but is this actually how it is, or do you have to pay tax on each realized gain and count each realized loss against your total income that you pay taxes on? Basically would you have to pay taxes on the $1200 that you gained and then get to deduct the loss of $800 from your taxable income?

But looking at the 5 year track for many stocks it seems difficult for me to get into it now.  For example Nvidia was $20 per share 5 years ago. And its $170 now.  Amazon was a $300/ share and now its $1700/ share.  It's obvious the market has grown exponentially well in the last 5 to 10 years.  Even though I only gave 2 examples a lot of the market seems to be at a premium right now.  

So should I buy into stocks like apple, google, amazon, microsoft, now while they are at an all time high and expect them to continue growing. Or should I look for stocks that are coming up now and will be higher in the next 5 years.  A lot of people made wealth by buying into these companies but 5 years ago I could have purchased almost 6 shares of amazon for the price of one today.

The merge will create a new global pharmaceutical company.

The new company will be domiciled in the US, and incorporated in Delaware and will operate Global Centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Shanghai, China, and Hyderabad, India. The new business is expected to have pro forma 2020 revenues ranging US$19 to $20 billion.

Mylan brings a diverse portfolio across many geographies and key therapeutic areas, such as central nervous system and anaesthesia, infectious disease and cardiovascular, as well as a robust pipeline, high-quality manufacturing and supply chain excellence.

Upjohn brings trusted, iconic brands, such as Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), Celebrex (celecoxib) and Viagra (sildenafil), and proven commercialisation capabilities, including leadership positions in China and other emerging markets.

Robert J. Coury, Mylan Chairman, commented: ""The new company, which combines the unique assets of Mylan with the iconic brands of Pfizer’s Upjohn business, will not only accelerate our mission to serve the world’s changing health needs, but also further unlock the true value of our platform while delivering attractive returns to shareholders for many years to come.""

Coury said the combined organisation will have a presence across nearly every continent and major market, establishing a new leadership position in Asia, and offering products capable of treating all major therapeutic areas. ""This combination also further accelerates Mylan’s longstanding strategy to create the operational scale and commercial capabilities necessary to provide the world’s more than seven billion people with access to medicine.""

We are creating a new champion for global health—one poised to bring world-class medicines to patients across a wide range of therapeutic areas

The transaction will allow the new company to meaningfully expand the geographic reach of Mylan’s existing broad product portfolio and future pipeline—including significant investments that have been made across complex generics and biosimilars—into new growth markets where Upjohn has existing sales infrastructure and local market expertise.

Dr Albert Bourla, Pfizer CEO, commented: “We are creating a new champion for global health—one poised to bring world-class medicines to patients across a wide range of therapeutic areas.""

For Bourla, by bringing Mylan’s growth assets to Upjohn’s growth markets, the companies will create a financially strong business with true global reach.

""I’m also excited about the management team, which combines strong executive talent from both companies, whose commitment to improving global health for patients and to delivering returns to shareholders are great assets for the new company,"" Bourla said.

Under the terms of the agreement, which is structured as an all-stock Reverse Morris Trust transaction, each Mylan share would be converted into one share of the new company

President Trump just hiked tariffs from 10% to 25% on about $200 billion in Chinese imports. In other words, he just raised taxes by … $30 billion a year. Oh, no! The total amount we all paid in taxes last year — federal, state and local — was $5.51 trillion. This tax increase that has everyone’s panties in a twist is a rounding error. Meanwhile, the total value wiped off U.S. stocks during Monday’s panic was about $700 billion. More than 20 years’ worth of the new tariffs.”

So I'm looking for some advice here. 

I have decided to set aside $3000 to invest in the Australian stock market. The goal of doing so is to learn how to develop my own investment strategies and identify investment opportunities. Ultimately I would like to learn to think like a trader because I aspire to be one.

Now I understand  that trading and investing are different, but with only $3k I can only make a very few number of trades   due to transaction costs. 

So my question is, can I learn to trade by learning to invest? or do trading and investing require fundamentally different skillsets? 

Also, I would like to know what investment horizon would be best for my situation and what investment strategies should I then consider?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I made a trading strategy back tester in python and wanted to share.

Running the \`backtest.py\` file will start a run. Strategies can be written as scripts and added to the \`add\_strategies\` function. If anyone has any requests, I'd be happy to add strategies for anyone who just wants to run the program.

Will my stock be tied up until the investigation is finished?

It could be that I've invested in both of these companies in the last 2 weeks and lost almost 18% so far but I'm started to believe these two innovative companies will be nonexistent in 10 years time. They are still great short term investments as they aren't completely useless (valued about $100 billion combined for a reason).

Why? They are not making little to no money right now and just gaining brand popularity and are betting on making money once they can roll out self-driving cars. Uber more than Lyft which is why Uber is losing a lot more money on research than Lyft. Once self-driving cars do roll out, I think a lot more people would use Waymo by Google and its all because of Google Maps. Everyone uses Google Maps, there is no good alternative. Even Uber uses Google Maps. When people search where they want to go, Google can easily advertise their Waymo self-driving cars that can make them tons of money. Noone is competing with Uber or Lyft right now because it's not worth it. These companies are not making much money. Self-driving cars are what Uber and Lyft are both relying on. Uber is making their own self-driving technology but Lyft will probably license something from Tesla or Google. Google, however, have a huge advantage with Google Maps and having Android cover 85% of smartphone users. They can have Waymo pre-installed in the app and integrated with Google Maps.

Same goes with food (like UBER-EATS) and groceries. My bet is Google will dominate these two industries with their Android-users and Google Search. The only other competitors I can see is Amazon (using its Amazon-prime members) and Apple (using its iOS-users).

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 26th, 2019.

# **Week ahead: Stocks could be rocky on trade, economy fears, as August breaks low volatility streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/week-ahead-stocks-could-be-rocky-on-trade-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; The final week of August — the bittersweet end of summer for many— could be highly volatile, as markets fret over the economy and the latest developments in trade wars.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump joins the G-7 leaders in France over the weekend, and markets will be watching to see if the meeting exposes new fault lines in the shaky relations among a once fairly congenial leadership group that fought the Great Recession together. Trump is expected to discuss the U.S. economy and highlight the U.S. pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda, under his leadership.
*****
&gt; The U.S. trade war with China escalated sharply in the past week, with a new round of tariffs from China on U.S. goods announced Friday and new threats from Trump, who “ordered” American companies to find alternatives to China. That immediately triggered speculation that the trade war will be extended and more contentious, and the U.S. economy risks falling into recession.
*****
&gt; After the close Friday, Trump retaliated against China’s tariffs by raising existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30% from 25%, as of Oct. 1. In a tweet, he also said he was raising new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods that have not yet gone into effect to 15% from 10%.
*****
&gt; Friday’s trading was volatile, and stocks fell by about 2.5%, erasing what would have been a second positive week for the market. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to go lower amid worries about the economy and fears the Fed will not act aggressively enough to head off a recession.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 is down about 4.5% in the month of August.
*****
&gt; Michael Arone, State Street Advisors chief investment strategist said the first seven months of the year were more certain for investors in terms of their expectations for Fed rate cuts and a possible trade deal. But the trade tensions have worsened, and the trade war could escalate even further.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole Friday morning, but while he left the door open for rate cuts, he did not explicitly promise rate cuts.
*****
&gt; “The Fed has become a lot less certain. Until we get more clarity, you’re likely to see this volatility, and stocks will trade sideways,” Arone said. Even though corporate earnings weakened, “investors took a big leap of faith in the first seven months of the year, expecting both a trade deal and monetary policy easing.”
*****
&gt; The escalation of the trade war makes a deal unlikely anytime soon. This, however, did drive market expectations for rate cuts higher Friday afternoon, and the market was expecting three more cuts this year.
*****
&gt; Trump tied his feuds with China and the Fed together Friday, when he tweeted that the Fed is not helping with easier rate policy, along with a question about “who is the bigger enemy” — China President Xi Jinping or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed is in uncharted territory, and I continue to have empathy for Chairman Powell. I think markets want faster and more aggressive policy. He’s dealing with challenges the Fed has never had,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; ”[Powell] is literally walking a tight rope. He has the president who is daily bashing him,” he said. “Bond markets are demanding a much greater number of rate cuts, and he’s got geopolitical challenges, whether it’s Brexit or trade. He’s also got dissension among Fed voting members. That’s a lot to balance.”
*****
&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including durable goods Monday and personal spending and consumption data Friday, which also includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator.
*****
&gt; “The data will give us some indications on business spending. Durable goods has capital expenditure orders. It looks look consumer confidence will come out [Tuesday] as well,” Arone said. Business spending has been taking a hit from the trade wars, and economists are concerned it will continue to weaken, ultimately leading to weakness in the consumer economy.
*****
&gt; The week ahead could see some swings ahead of the long Labor Day Holiday weekend. “Given high absentees and low volumes, my guess is it’s going to add to volatility,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; Frank Cappelleri, Nomura executive director, said he also expects volatility, and the S&amp;P could test the outer limits of its recent range.
*****
&gt; Of the 17 trading days this month, nine of them saw absolute 1% moves in the S&amp;P 500. The last time that occurred was in December, when there were 10 days with 1% moves, according to Cappelleri. The most in one month was February, 2018 when there were 12. Contrast that to the entire year of 2017, when there were just eight.
*****
&gt; Friday’s action was volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 was down as much as 3%.
*****
&gt; “This is the third-biggest decline we’ve had this month. Each of them started within 10 points of each other, near the top of the range,” said Cappelleri. The top of the range is 2,943, its Aug. 13 high, and the bottom is 2,820, near the Aug. 5 low.
*****
&gt; “We’re obviously still in a trading range that has been characterized by sharp moves and acute turns, so I think when we had that initial drop on Aug. 5, the question is where is it going to stop,” he said, adding traders are watching that Aug. 5 level to see if it will act as a floor.

# Second Half August Trading: Historically Weak Too

&gt; Following three straight days of gains, the market has recovered a sizable portion of its losses from earlier in the month. Losses earlier in the month and gains over the past three days (prior to today) have tracked August’s typical trading pattern for over the last 21-years quite closely. The magnitude of the moves this year has been larger than average, but the pattern has been tracked.

Due to the magnitude of this year’s moves, August’s performance over the past 21-years has been plotted on the left vertical axis in the chart above and 2019 is plotted on the right. From right around mid-month or now through the end of August, the historical trend has been weaker. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have all averaged a loss in August from 1998 to 2018 and they are on track to repeat this year.

# Is a Small-Cap Labor Day Rally Coming Soon

&gt; In the below chart, forty years of daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e6c3b63cadd687e835cca014192dd72/fcd39e87be04620c-93/s500x750/7e0c19f7fee940a61f9ece5a88f65d53900365f3.jpg))**

&gt; In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of Friday’s close (August 16, 2019), Russell 2000 is up 10.8% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 15.5% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

# September Almanac: No Respite in Pre-Election Years

&gt; The start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. September gets no respite from positive pre-election year forces.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e73bc3f171da163b1e601cc26081c21/773b35094e2a77db-2e/s400x600/50353a79845a11b2bdb490f6a5ae95d25a672388.jpg))**

&gt; Although the month used to open strong, S&amp;P 500 has declined eight times in the last eleven years on the first trading day. As tans begin to fade and the new school year begins, fund managers tend to sell underperforming positions as the end of the third quarter approaches, causing some nasty selloffs near month-end over the years. Recent substantial declines occurred following the terrorist attacks in 2001 (DJIA: –11.1%), 2002 (DJIA –12.4%), the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 (DJIA: –6.0%) and U.S. debt ceiling debacle in 2011 (DJIA –6.0%). However, September is improving with S&amp;P 500 advancing in ten of the last 15 Septembers and DJIA climbing in nine.

# Leading Indicators Signal Growth Ahead

&gt; U.S. leading indicators rebounded in July, a good sign for the durability of the expansion.

&gt; The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) rose 0.5% month over month, the biggest gain since September 2018, and above consensus expectations for a 0.3% increase. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Leading Indicators Slowing But Growing, the LEI climbed 1.6% year over year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DUqIDwl.jpg))**

&gt; The LEI, which we include as one of the “Five Forecasters” of our Recession Watch Dashboard, has yet to turn negative this cycle. The index has fallen negative year over year before all nine recessions since 1955.

&gt; “Some investors have pointed out slowing LEI growth as a reason for caution,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “However, the LEI is signaling moderate U.S. economic growth ahead, with no signs of an imminent recession.”

&gt; The LEI is calculated from 10 individual leading data sets, including weekly jobless claims, building permits, and stock prices. This year, the majority of LEI components have boosted month-over-month growth in the index, but more internationally exposed data sets have turned into net drags.

&gt; In July, 6 of 10 components rose month over month, but four components—average hours worked, manufacturers’ new orders, new orders for nondefense capital spending, and interest rate spreads—fell month over month. Historically, breadth in LEI components has deteriorated further before a recession began. In contrast, at the end of each of the past six economic cycles, more than half of the LEI components were in decline.

&gt; While evidence of slowing growth in leading indicators is disappointing, we are encouraged by what we see outside of manufacturing. Global manufacturing has been the sector hardest hit by prolonged trade tensions and weakened demand, and we don’t expect to see much improvement until a U.S.-China trade resolution is reached. Even then, a recovery in manufacturing may take some time.

# Complexity Behind the Fed Rate Cut

&gt; Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) July meeting, released August 21, show the complexity of policymakers’ discussions leading up to the first rate cut of this economic cycle.

&gt; Policymakers debated what to do amid strong consumer spending, a solid labor market, tepid inflation, sluggish business investment, financial stability, global risks, and the persistent headwind of trade uncertainty. Ultimately, the Fed announced a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate reduction after a vote with two dissents (Fed presidents Esther George from Kansas City and Eric Rosengren from Boston).

&gt; The minutes also reinforced Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s description of the rate cut as a “mid-cycle adjustment,” a characterization that was especially evident from upbeat economic commentary. These rate changes, which we’ve referred to as “course corrections,” have been a feature of many economic cycles and have been more of a risk management tool in response to building risks than a response to an impending recession.

&gt; “The Fed recognized the growing need for looser policy as insurance against heightened global uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Lower rates could provide a buffer if uncertainty materially weighs on growth, reducing the chances of a policy mistake or a rush to cut rates before a recession.”

&gt; Participants generally agreed that the U.S. economic outlook was solid, even though inflation had slipped a little this year. In fact, domestic economic strength was the driving force behind the two dissents. George voted against a rate cut because there were few signs of weakness in incoming data or the medium-term economic outlook. Rosengren dissented because he saw no “clear and compelling case” for rate cuts, especially given his concerns for financial stability.

&gt; The minutes, however, gave few clues on the future path of policy, and participants emphasized the importance of maintaining “optionality” with policy and basing rate decisions on incoming information.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Investors Expect More Rate Cuts Ahead, investors are positioning for multiple 25 basis point rate cuts through the end of 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PPwxsaE.png))**

&gt; We agree that one or two more 25 basis point “insurance” rate cuts could be ahead as the Fed attempts to ease pressure on the Treasury yield curve and global currencies.

# Crude Oil's Descending Triangle

&gt; Earlier this week, crude oil was trading well over 2% higher than last Friday's close. Over the past few sessions, though, oil has given up all of those gains. The catalyst for today's declines are the Chinese retaliatory tariffs on US crude which are expected to dampen demand. This week's negative reversal comes as the commodity ran into multiple points of resistance. For starters, the rally began to stall out mid-week when it met the converging 200 and 50-day moving averages. This also coincided with a downtrend that traces itself all the way back to the highs from late last year. In fact, crude is down around 30% from these previous highs.

&gt; Overall, the technical picture for crude oil is not in a great place as the chart is forming a descending triangle pattern. Despite the big gains at the beginning of 2019, over the past few months, crude has been making consistent lower highs and lower lows. Given this most recent failure to retake the moving averages and break out of the downtrend, the next major support level to watch is around $50 which is a level that has held up at multiple times in the past few months. This support also draws back to late last year prior to the collapse in December.

# Yield Curves: Another Record Streak Bites the Dust

&gt; After the 3-month vs 10-year US Treasury yield curve first inverted earlier this year, the market has shifted its focus to the 2-year vs 10-year part of the curve which had yet to reach inverted levels. That was, until yesterday. While the 10s2s curve flirted with inverted territory for the last few days on an intraday basis, Thursday was the first time in more than a decade that the closing yield on the two-year US Treasury was above the yield on the 10-year. And with another closely watched part of the curve moving into inverted levels, recession fears increased.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-10s2s-YC-Long-Terms.png))**

&gt; As the chart above illustrates, it has been a while since the 10s2s curve was inverted. In fact, the streak that just ended was the longest on record going back to 1977, and it wasn't even close. Going back to 1977, there have only been three prior streaks where the 10s2s curve was inverted for more than 1,000 days, and never before had the curve been positively sloped for more than 2,000 days. The current streak, though? 3,054 days. It was fun while it lasted!

# Adapt or Die

&gt; A common characteristic of most investors and traders is to always be on the lookout for patterns and connections between various asset classes. Whenever one correlated asset confirms the move in another it adds a layer of confidence to an investor's thesis. One long-held example is the Dow Transports as a leading or coincident indicator for the broader market. For decades now, many investors have followed the transports for confirmation of the broader market moves. If the transports — which move all of the physical goods in the economy — rally, it suggests that the broader market will be strong, while periods when the transports start to roll over are read as a signal that there's an underlying weakness in the economy.

&gt; As the US economy has become more service and digital-oriented in nature, there has been a valid argument made that the transports have lost some of their importance as an indicator of the broader economy. Along these lines, we have suggested that rather than transports, semiconductors may represent this century's 'transports' as they are a part of just about everything in this digital age. Whether you agree with this or not isn't important, but the important takeaway is that just because two asset classes have been highly correlated in the past doesn't mean that they will remain that way in the future. It's one thing to recognize a correlation between two asset classes, but it's much more important to understand why they are correlated and be on the lookout for factors that may change the status quo in the future.

&gt; One example of a radical change in a relationship between two asset classes is the interaction between the relative strength of growth and value stocks versus the slope of the yield curve. From 2002 through 2011, the two were closely correlated. As the curve flattened in the early part of this century, growth stocks underperformed value by a wide margin (falling blue line). Then in mid-2007, as the curve steepened and came out from inverted territory, growth stocks started to rip higher relative to value. Beginning in 2009, though, the curve stopped steepening and the relative strength of growth relative to value stalled out. The two series were so closely joined at the hip during this ten-year stretch that the correlation coefficient between the two was +0.82, which is indicative of two series moving in lockstep with each other.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2002-2019.png))**

&gt; If the paths of the yield curve and the relative strength of growth versus value couldn't be separated from 2002 through 2011, the relationship soured in 2012 when the two came down with a case of the ten-year itch. At that point, they couldn't separate fast enough. The chart below shows the same two series from the start of 2012 through the present. Now, when one goes up the other goes down and vice versa, as the paths are nearly exact opposites. In fact, in the nearly eight years since 2012, the correlation between the two is -0.90.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2012-2019.png))**

&gt; In the chart below we have shown the two series over the entire time period spanning 2002 through 2019. The non-shaded area represents the period covered in the first chart, while the shaded area covers the second period. Right around the time where the shaded period starts is when the positive correlation turned on a dime, and beginning in 2013 when the curve started to flatten, investors who were still hanging on to the idea that a flatter yield curve was a green light for value stocks, saw what turned out to be an extended period of misery relative to the performance of growth stocks. In the words of Intel Founder Andy Grove, ""Adapt or Die.""

# Nasdaq 100 to S&amp;P 500 Ratio

&gt; Below is a chart of the Nasdaq 100 going back to 1990. While it took 15+ years for the index to make a new all-time closing high following its March 2000 peak, the index is currently 65% above those March 2000 highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ndx100.png))**

&gt; Below is a ratio chart of the Nasdaq 100's price versus the S&amp;P 500's price since 1990. The ratio started well below 1 in early 1990 but quickly overtook the S&amp;P in price by the mid-90s. As you can see, the ratio spiked dramatically above 3 during the peak of the Dot Com bubble in late 1999. The Nasdaq 100 then gave up much of that outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 over a 2-3 year period where the ratio got all the way back down to 1, but since then it has been steadily trending higher to its current level of 2.65. While it went through a bubble and a burst over a 5-year period, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 for a long time now.

I'm trying to settle a debate with my friend on whether the average day trader is profitable or not vs the average sports bettor.

I am a sports bettor. And my friend does long term shares.

In sports betting. Most sites only charge commission when you win. This evolved from sites competing with each other for punters. ""We only charge commission if you are a winning"" draws in punters.

So why is this not a thing for sharebrokers? You'd think the natural evolution would be for them to compete with each other for traders. Until a company decides to take it to the next level. Advertise: ""We only charge commission when you sell your stock at a higher price"".

**My theory:** 

In sports betting. With any bet, half the players are winners* and half the players are losers.

But in day trading. The majority of day traders are losers. And if sharebrokers don't charge commission on the losers. They will not be profitable in the long run.

&amp;nbsp;

*Winner doesn't mean profitable. If you have a 50% winrate. You are unprofitable because of commission.

Hello my dear r/stocks commmunity,

I started looking into the reports made by Teva and no matter where I look, I can't seem to find how much of their revenue is composed of Opioids such as Oxycontin and Oxycodone. Teva was a minor producer of this poison in 2015, accounting for just 1% of the total opioid production, but after having acquired Actavis (which held a 34% market share in this multibillion industry) it's questionable why opioids don't hold a place in their accounting. Could anyone point me in the right direction on this one, or tell me why I'm deadass wrong on something, because I'm really curious about this.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I'm a S. Korea resident and currently investing in the KRX(Korean Exchange), the US market and HK.

I was just searching brokerage fees and commissions offered by US and HK securities companies, and it seems that S. Korea has a really low brokerage fee.

For the Korean KRX market, most companies offer 0.1% fees with no minimum fee, and some offering lifetime free trading like Samsung Securities which I'm using. Really good! They offer a HTS home trading system, too
.

For foreign markets like US, HK, and China you have to pay only about 0.2~0.3% with NO minimum fees
 However you have to pay approx 10 USD per month to get real-time market price, or you will get a 20 min delayed price.

I was searching for fees of major brokerage companies like fidelity Morgan Stanley citi Charles Schwab, and they seem quite expansive.

However, I have barely any idea how stocks even work, and having looked it up, I'm advised to call people, but all of this is exceedingly unclear. Can someone explain what I should do, and what I should look out for? Or really anything else you can think of that would be helpful.

Sorry if some of those questions are vague, but I just really have no idea and wikis/forums aren't helping.

My last post here was on buying $PAGS a long long time ago, and that thesis was all based off of some generalizations I made due to $SQ success and the Brazilian economy (moving towards more electronic transactions). Well today I bring to you a more well thought out idea on going long a pretty much bloated ass company. It's semi-contrarian but not really depending on how pragmatic you look at it from the perspective I am giving.

$COTY basically does cosmetics. When I say cosmetics, I mean they basically have their fking hands in everything. As a dude, I know not too  much about this industry but let me give you a super over generalization of $COTY: any brand you see at Walgreens, Krogers, Macys, basically fking anywhere, it's not a bad bet to say $COTY has its hands in it. 

So why go long $COTY when it's stock price has been eating shit when you look at its chart? Enter JAB Holdings. You might remember JAB from numerous things that have happened in the past 5 years: Dr. Pepper-Keurig; Panera Bread; Krispy Kreme....What do a lot of their deals have in common? THEY GO FKING PRIVATE. Why does this matter for $COTY? Well, if you google ""Coty JAB Holdings"" articles will come up showing how they increased their position in the company from 40% to 60%. They paid somewhere around $11\~$12 a share for that 20% of the company at that time, WHICH WASN'T THAT LONG AGO. Since then the stock has been eating shit.

So, my idea is that you long $COTY with the idea that JAB will just take that bitch private. If you're asking how much the premium will be or if now is a good price...I HAVE NO IDEA. But I believe that my logic is sound in JAB going for that last 40%, especially since they believed at the time that $11ish a share was a good deal. 

I'm basically sitting and watching for a little bit because this is basically a new predicament as the price only ate shit a week or so ago. But with prices as low as they are now, JAB has to be thinking about it at least. The worst case scenario is that they just dump all their shares and this thing goes all the way down, but I don't see that happening because going the other way and buying up all the shares and taking it private will make it easier for them to operate. Simply being private reduces their costs as well as their ability to be more flexible.

Anyway, just a thought. Wondering what you guys thought. I tried to reddit search in this subreddit for the last month or so if anyone wrote anything and I didn't see anything.

Please note: I am not long in $COTY but I might YOLO a significant part of my portfolio in it soonish.

P.S.: I think you can also look at $IFF to see that the industry as a whole isn't doing so hot.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,397579,public,self,Long $COTY -- just a thought because JAB Holdings involved,0,1566505370,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ctmheh/long_coty_just_a_thought_because_jab_holdings/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,

ENPH's main competitor is SEDG who makes an inferior product because the inverters are wired in parallel and the current is converted in a centralized system, resulting in further power loss. SEDG claims their system works ""like"" microinverters but I haven't seen a satisfactory explanation of how/in what way, although I am no electrician.
ENPH also has a HUGE bonus selling point. They next generation of microinverters coming out in the next few months will be capable of ""islanding.""
Let's say your power goes out due to a hurricane. The entire block is out of power. But you've got solar panels so you're set, right? Wrong. Because the electricity in your panels could kill a utility worker since you're still connected to the grid, so running them is illegal.
Islanding will enable you to run your panels legally in this scenario

I work for a software company and as part of my compensation, I received some restricted stock units and shares last year. These needed to be vested on a period of 4 years, so I could sell the first portion of the shares this year. I was advised to keep all of them for as long as I could, so that the profit is higher. However, due to unplanned circumstances, I had to sell the first part. The price had gone up so I made a bit of profit and the money helped (around $1,200). Now I still have 87 exercisable options at a grant price of $43 and the price is now $53. I would like to get some money on these too (again, life happened and money is needed), but I'm not sure I understand how. I have the following options on my account: Exercise and Sell OR Exercise and Hold. I assume I would need to choose the first one. However, I don't really understand the example provided forthis option: ""if I have 200 shares at grant price of $20 and the  Fair Market Value at Exercise is $30 per share, I exercise the 200 shares at $20 per share, resulting in option cost of $4,000. The 200 shares sell at $30 for a total of $6,000. Now I owe $4,500 in exercise costs: $4,000 for option costs and $500 in taxes (25% of the $10 gain in share value). The $4,000 for option costs is deducted from my sales proceeds. The remaining $2,000 (minus any taxes and fees) is deposited in my participant trust. Within 3 days, $500 in taxes is withdrawn from my participant trust. The remaining proceeds are approximately $1,500"". So this was the example provided. In my case, this would mean $3,741 (87\*$43) in option cost; $4,611 for the 87 shares sold at $53 per share. Now I owe $3,741 plus 25% of the exercise price minus the grant price ($870\*0.25=$217.5), so a total of $3958.5. This means a profit of around $600. Am I correct in my calculations? Is it worth to sell at this price? Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated!

The 5G iPhone cycle and accelerating Services growth are likely positive catalysts for AAPL over the coming year.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Generally speaking, options provide plenty of strategies for making money; ones that can't be subject to duplication with conventional securities.

New to this forum and pretty green when it comes to trading.  For retirement I pretty much just hit my 401K match and then put money into my Roth.  That said, I just left my previous employer (Comcast) and have a small number of options that are due to expire in October.  This is my first exposure to options, so I had a could advice type questions.  I was granted 250 options at $37.46.  Comcast is currently at \~$43.  It seems like I have about 3 potential options:

1. Exercise today and immediately sell
2. Exercise today and hold the stock
3. Wait and follow the price up until October and exercise at some point along the way, and then either sell or hold.

Does anyone think I should hold these options a bit longer, or go ahead and exercise them now?  Seems like my quick research shows Comcast to be trending downwards, at least in the short-term, so i was thinking about going ahead and exercising these soon.

Originally my plan was going to be to immediately sell these off, but it also seems like folks think Comcast might trend back upwards over the next 4-5 years.  In that case would I be better off holding this stock for now?  My thought was that Comcast would not be a good stock to hold, but I'd love some outside opinions.

Have a glance at his Wikipedia page ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry\_Markopolos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markopolos)). He clearly has the ability to find and expose fraud and bad/aggressive accounting practices. So, as a GE shareholder (I bought 1000 shares during the Dec. '18 dip), what in the hell do we do?

The GE argument is:

“Mr. Markopolos’s report contains false statements of fact and these claims could have been corrected if he had checked them with GE before publishing the report. The fact that he wrote a 170-page paper but never talked to company officials goes to show that he is not interested in accurate financial analysis, but solely in generating downward volatility in GE stock so that he and his undisclosed hedge fund partner can personally profit.”

But if we analyze this statement a bit it brings up some doubts and concerns. If Markopolos had attempted to check with GE before publishing, who would of he spoke with to do so? My guess is any number of their lawyers who would have refused to comment or issued a blanket statement denying any and all possible wrongdoing or risk. Would Larry Culp (GE CEO)  actually pickup the phone and discuss these issues with Markopolos? And what company officials would even have the authorization to speak with Markopolos, besides lawyers mentioned above not willing to speak about specifics?

The big action of putting your money where your mouth is did come from Culp, who purchased 225,000 shares at $9.73 for a total of $2.2 million. Though, we have to take into account how much Culp is worth to understand the small risk a $2 million bet is to him. I can't find exact figures, but it seems like he's worth a few hundred million dollars from his time as CEO of Danaher alone. He makes $1.5 million a year at GE, and stands to make over $15 million if the stock goes up. Putting down $2 million for a potential $15 million payday doesn't sound like a bad investment to me, especially given the immediate stock crash following the report by Markopolos and that $15 million award based upon GE's share price. 

Even if we believe that Culp's $2 million buy was based on both potential profit and good faith, is the good faith portion knowledgeable of the accounting practices taking place? If the accusations by Markopolos are correct, this fraud/bad/aggressive accounting has been in place before he arrived. Does he have the expertise to uncover or even understand the accounting currently taking place?

I regret not selling at around $10 right now, and wondering if I should just take what little profit I can before, to use a word from Markopolos, a GEnron situation takes place.

I get lots of PMs about how to top tick. The trades presented are shorts exclusively. I hope this is value to you.

Around 3 years ago, my trades would look like this: https://imgur.com/BOfQa6I

My thought process was simple, short the resistance lines. At the time, it was only a slightly upgraded strategy from my previous one; shorting a breakdown. Prior to that, it was simply copying trades from those I thought had more knowledge than me. Turns out all these strategies were hopeless dead-ends. It wasn't because of my lack of ""hope"" or determination, rather it was due to a lack of asking why. Why would a stock keep going above my resistance entry? Why would people buy here? Why is the person posting this ticker that I traded?

Problem was, even when I had answers, the answers would be nothing but subjective interpretations of things I've already concluded. For example if I was going long: Why would a stock go up? My reason: Because it's a good buy. It's not going deep into why it would be a good buy, nor is it looking to falsify why.

Imagine a scenario with a person you know. It could be with a person you know on the side, or maybe a friend. Let's say for instance, this scenario is what you'd perceive as ""negative."" Now if you ask why it was a negative scenario, your first instinct is to look out for evidence proving why it is. At this point, I suggest a simple change in thinking. Look out for evidence why the negative scenario is wrong, rather than right. This is the basics on how to successfully grow on a strategy and break out.

Circling back into stocks. Top-ticking is almost entirely feel based. Meaning after so many years of seeing the same patterns over and over, you know what to expect on certain moves. While it's not a guarantee, you know the odds are in your favor.

If you're still at the newbie stage, you likely fall for stock picks and a lack of autonomous decision making. To those who have an outside perspective, you'll notice the newbies drink the kool-aid of stock promoters, some you'll see post their tickers on this sub reddit. It puts the newbies odds of winning to a coin flip at best. If you want to improve your trading, watch your own trades back on a screen recording relentlessly. 1 hour a day isn't enough, make it at least 5 hours of picking out patterns in the recording. Actively falsify hypothesis you create about a movement. Overtime, this will propel you beyond the competition.

Here are 4 recent trades that I either top ticked or came close to: https://imgur.com/uUQ6Auh https://imgur.com/2xNIK27 https://imgur.com/8YjukYU https://imgur.com/AG2335a

I watched the screen-captured recordings of all these trades individually several hours each. I won't go into too much detail what I look for, but the chart is maybe 10% of it, the other 90% is hypothesis and a seeking of axiomatic patterns hidden inside the tape. Create hypothesis on a stocks movement, actively falsify it, refine it, then work upon it; it'll work out for you in the long-run.

Happy trading! -

I get lots of PMs about how to top tick. The trades presented are shorts exclusively. I hope this is value to you.

Around 3 years ago, my trades would look like this: https://imgur.com/BOfQa6I

My thought process was simple, short the resistance lines. At the time, it was only a slightly upgraded strategy from my previous one; shorting a breakdown. Prior to that, it was simply copying trades from those I thought had more knowledge than me. Turns out all these strategies were hopeless dead-ends. It wasn't because of my lack of ""hope"" or determination, rather it was due to a lack of asking *why*. Why would a stock keep going above my resistance entry? Why would people buy here? Why is the person posting this ticker that I traded?

Problem was, even when I had answers, the answers would be nothing but subjective interpretations of things I've already concluded. For example if I was going long: Why would a stock go up? My reason: Because it's a good buy. It's not going deep into *why* it would be a good buy, nor is it looking to *falsify* why. 

Imagine a scenario with a person you know. It could be with a person you know on the side, or maybe a friend. Let's say for instance, this scenario is what you'd perceive as ""negative."" Now if you ask *why* it was a negative scenario, your first instinct is to look out for evidence proving why it is. At this point, I suggest a simple change in thinking. Look out for evidence *why* the negative scenario is wrong, rather than right. This is the basics on how to successfully grow on a strategy and break out.

Circling back into stocks. Top-ticking is almost entirely feel based. Meaning after so many years of seeing the same patterns over and over, you know what to expect on certain moves. While it's not a guarantee, you know the odds are in your favor. 

If you're still at the newbie stage, you likely fall for stock picks and a lack of autonomous decision making. To those who have an outside perspective, you'll notice the newbies drink the kool-aid of stock promoters, some you'll see post their tickers on this sub reddit. It puts the newbies odds of winning to a coin flip at best. If you want to improve your trading, watch your own trades back on a screen recording relentlessly. 1 hour a day isn't enough, make it at least 5 hours of picking out patterns in the recording. Actively falsify hypothesis you create about a movement. Overtime, this will propel you beyond the competition. 

Here are 4 recent trades that I either top ticked or came close to:
https://imgur.com/uUQ6Auh
https://imgur.com/2xNIK27
https://imgur.com/8YjukYU
https://imgur.com/AG2335a

I watched the **screen-captured recordings** of all these trades individually several hours each. I won't go into too much detail what I look for, but the chart is maybe 10% of it, the other 90% is hypothesis and a seeking of axiomatic patterns hidden inside the tape. Create hypothesis on a stocks movement, actively falsify it, refine it, then work upon it; it'll work out for you in the long-run.

Happy trading! -

When do you receive payment from dividends and how do you know who pays dividends?

What is the point of having shares that don’t pay dividends?

If I own 51% of a company shares dose that mean I run the company (😂 I understand this is not really the point of trading)

# **Here’s what Powell could say at Jackson Hole to soothe the roller coaster markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/heres-what-powell-could-say-at-jackson-hole-to-soothe-the-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; If the markets get their way, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will use the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium to clarify whether the Fed is at the beginning of a serious rate cutting cycle — or just intending to cut a few times, as insurance against a possible downturn.
*****
&gt; Powell speaks Friday morning to kick off the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, and that event is the main focus of markets in the week ahead. The Fed also releases the minutes of its July meeting Wednesday afternoon, and it is expected to detail discussions around its decision to cut interest rates last month for the first time in more than a decade.
*****
&gt; In a briefing following that meeting, Powell discussed the quarter point rate cut as a “midcycle adjustment,” implying it was just considering a few cuts. That comment shook markets, and interest rates have plunged, along with global bond yields.
*****
&gt; “What the market wants is clearly that he moves away from the ‘midcycle adjustment’ commentary and transition toward an easing cycle,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Markets also will be watching any developments that reveal how trade talks between the U.S. and China are faring. President Donald Trump soothed some nerves in the past week when he delayed some of his latest tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump also said Thursday that discussions are continuing, and that he expects to talk to President Xi Jinping soon, though he gave no details.
*****
&gt; Powell speaks at a time when markets have been doubting the Fed’s ability to head off a recession. Since he spoke on July 31, the stock market has been turbulent, with the S&amp;P 500 losing nearly 3%, but the move in interest rates has been massive. The 10-year yield was at 2.07% that day, and touched a low of 1.475% on Thursday before returning to 1.54% by late Friday.
*****
&gt; The Treasury’s 30-year bond made a historic move in the past week, when its yield fell to a record low of 1.915%, before rising back above 2% Friday. Also, the most widely watched part of the yield curve inverted, when the 2-year yield made the unusual move of temporarily rising above the 10-year yield. That would be taken as a sign of pending recession if it inverts again and stays that way for some time.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower for the week, but reversed sharper losses by the end of the week. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.4% Friday at 2,888, but was down 1% for the week. The Dow rose 1.2% to 25,886 Friday, but lost 1.5% for the week.
*****
&gt; Dramatic moves in the world’s sovereign yields came as global central banks cut interest rates, and there was talk from a European Central Bank official that the ECB could use a big stimulus program. That puts extra pressure on the Fed, which has emphasized that it could lower rates because of the weak global economy, the impact of trade wars and sluggish inflation. Rates all over the globe moved lower, and the benchmark German 10-year bund set a new low of negative 0.73 Friday morning.
*****
&gt; “They don’t want to signal they’re worried about the economy because the economy is doing okay, ” said Pramod Alturi, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group. “I think they can do it. It’s going to be a tough communications challenge. The worry is when they try to tow the line, they end up being more hawkish than the market is looking for.”
*****
&gt; Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said she is looking for Powell to comment on the yield curve inversion and the market turbulence. “Is he more concerned about the outlook?” she said. “Has he become more concerned since the meeting, given the slowdown in global data, the increase of risks in the trade war and the recent significant moves in the market” she said.
*****
&gt; The fed funds futures market is pricing in two to three rate cuts for the balance of the year. Since the Fed meeting, the market has become more concerned about the economy, with weaker global data from Europe and China, as well as a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods, announced by President Donald Trump.
*****
&gt; “Is Powell going to stick to the midcycle adjustment? It’s only been three weeks, but you throw in the sharp inversion of the yield curve and the extra consumer tariffs ... is he going to let the market whipsaw him? We’ve seen a big inversion and a sharp drop in rates since that meeting,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; Strategists said the Fed tries to avoid making policy changes at the Jackson Hole meeting, but it was done during the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; “Is it going to be an academic speech? Or is he going to pull a Ben Bernanke and use Jackson Hole as his FOMC venue. It was really [former Fed Chairman] Bernanke who most notably [used the meeting to discuss policy] when he laid out the case for QE twice,” Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Powell could also have to defend the Fed’s independence, and reiterate that he will stay in his position until his term expires, particularly after President Donald Trump criticized Fed policy and called him “clueless” this week.
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, there are some economic reports of interest in the week ahead. Existing home sales are announced Wednesday and PMI manufacturing and services data is released Thursday.
*****
&gt; Krosby said she is watching developments with Huawei, since the temporary licenses for U.S. firms doing business with the black-listed Chinese company end on August 19.
*****
&gt; “In terms of headlines this could be a market mover because of Huawei’s importance to Beijing. If there is an extension from the administration it could suggest an improvement in the D.C./Beijing dialogue, no doubt a positive headline,” she said, in an email. “We could find out what happens from a presidential tweet or from the Department of Commerce, which has jurisdiction over the issue.”

# Down Friday/Down Monday Streak Ending: A Quick Recovery Still Needed

&gt; Barring a late-day reversal, DJIA’s streak of Down Friday/Down Monday (DF/DM) will end today at two in a row. Recently we examined the record of past DF/DM occurrencesand noted that a quick DJIA recovery to pre-DF/DM levels was usually positive as it typically meant the worst of the decline was likely over. Today we delve deeper into the history of two or more DF/DMs in a row. 

&gt; Excluding the most recent occurrence, there have been two or more consecutive DF/DM’s 39 times since 2000. Of these 39, only four occurrences included three in a row. Using the last DF/DM of the streak as the starting point, the average decline from a subsequent high (within seven calendar days of Monday’s close) to the low sometime during the next 90 calendar days was 6.05% and all but three occurrences suffered a subsequent decline. Using Monday’s close as the refence point, the average decline was 4.53%. Only six of the 39 occurrences did not close lower than Monday’s close. The average number of calendar days until the low was reached was 45.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a585fbd0aabbcd377847808e5468eb9/5fd8a54415df2501-d0/s500x750/efa5fb4470880fa20bff91be98cac5f8a83a3d34.jpg))**

&gt; Looking at the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after Monday’s close of the last DF/DM of the streak, the patterns are similar to single DF/DM occurrences. If DJIA did not make a quick recovery to pre-DF/DM levels, then DJIA tended to struggle and drift lower.

# Yield Curve Inversion Triggers Risk Aversion

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20190814_3_per_losses_b4&amp;after.jpg))**

&gt; Unless you have been asleep for most of the day in preparation for an upcoming midnight shift, you have probably already heard, over and over, how the 10-year Treasury bond yield falling below the 2-year Treasury bond yield has a perfect record in recent years of forecasting a recession sometime in the future. The result was declines exceeding 3% by DJIA and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 just missed this mark falling 2.9%. Since 1971, when NASDAQ began, this combination of losses or worse has only occurred 66 times prior to today. And of these 66 times, 25 occurred during the financial crisis bear in 2008 and early 2009.

&gt; Plotting the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after past occurrences reveals (top chart) initial steep and brisk declines followed by modest average gains over the following 60 trading days (approximately three calendar months). However, market performance did pick up nicely at the 6-month and 12-month later points and the frequency of gains also improved. The market could be in for more choppy trading especially in the often-turbulent months of August, September and October.

# Yield Curve Inversion Raises Economic Questions

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the spread between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields fell as low as -2 basis points (-0.02%) in trading on August 14.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/yield-curve-blog-081419-artimg.png))**

&gt; Typically, yield curve inversion, when long-term yields fall below short-term yields, is viewed as a signal of oncoming recession, although often with a relatively long lead. In the past five economic expansions, the U.S. economy has peaked an average of 21 months after the spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields initially turned negative.

&gt; **U.S. Economy Remains on Solid Footing**

&gt; Even though we’re discouraged by the yield curve’s shape right now, we see few signs of danger ahead. Data shows the U.S. economy is on solid footing, and corporate debt spreads have remained contained in this latest bout of volatility. Financial conditions are still historically loose, yet there are few signs of excess in the financial system. U.S. stocks have also been resilient against yield curve inversions in the past: Historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has rallied an average of 22% from the first inversion to the eventual economic peak.

&gt; “We’re not convinced that this yield curve inversion is a sign of imminent recession,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “The U.S. labor market is at full employment, healthy wage growth is fueling strong consumer activity, and corporate profits are at record levels.”

&gt; **Global Perspective**

&gt; Of course, recessions can be self-fulfilling prophecies of market sentiment, and we take that risk seriously. However, it’s a curious time for global fixed income right now, and Treasury yields have been weighed down by intense global buying pressure amid ultra-low sovereign debt yields elsewhere. Because of this, we think the yield curve’s shape has been driven more by technical factors than domestic economic weakness.

&gt; **Monetary Policy Remains Too Tight**

&gt; This yield curve inversion sends an important signal to Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers. U.S. monetary policy is clearly still too tight, even after last month’s 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut, given trade uncertainty and signs of slowing global growth. The Fed has promised flexibility, and we expect policymakers to enact one or two more cuts by the end of the year. Without an easier Fed, the U.S. dollar may stay elevated and global buying pressure will continue in Treasuries.

&gt; **What’s Next?**

&gt; We will continue to monitor the yield curve and incoming economic data. For now, we think the current U.S. economic expansion, now in its 11th year, has more room to run.

# A Closer Look at Technical Support

&gt; We continue to believe there is technical support for the S&amp;P 500 Index as discussed in our August 9 blog, and we’re already seeing some signs of the pessimism that is necessary for forming a bottom. The negative sentiment intensified August 14 following the inversion of the yield curve (discussed in our August 14 blog), so today we want to take a closer look at some key levels the LPL Research team is watching.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Va6wqOv.png))**

&gt; First is resistance, or levels that an index or stock may struggle to rise above. Despite Tuesday’s 1.5% gain, the S&amp;P 500 ran right into its 50-day moving average near 2,940. This level also marked the 2018 highs for the market, adding to its significance.

&gt; As for support, or levels at which we think buyers are likely to step into the market, there are three key levels we are watching:
2,822. The intraday low from August 5 is only about 1% below Wednesday’s close, but it may be viewed by short-term traders as a tactical way to gauge whether we have hit the bottom in this current pullback.
&gt; 200-day moving average. Currently at 2,796, the 200-day moving average is a closely watched trend indicator that is commonly viewed as either support or resistance, depending on where the index sits in relation to it.
&gt; 2,740. Perhaps the strongest level of support for the S&amp;P 500 is 2,740. As seen in the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Key Levels for the S&amp;P 500 Index, this benchmark has actually tested 2,740 two times so far this year, but it failed to close below that level either time. 2,740 also happens to be 9.5% below the July highs, right in line with a standard 10% correction.
&gt; “We believe a retest of the December lows remains unlikely,” said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We think any decline beyond 10% from recent highs would be excessive, and we would recommend that suitable investors rebalance and add to positions accordingly if the S&amp;P 500 falls that far.”

My spreadsheet partly uses the spreadsheet in [their recent post about an automated portfolio they created.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cpu1j7/ive_recently_got_into_stocks_and_created_a/)  


**WHAT DOES THE SPREADSHEET DO?**

1. **Portfolio Optimisation Tool:** it finds the optimal construction of a portfolio of stocks. This means it constructs a portfolio where risk is minimised and return is maximised (more on this later).
2. **Automatic Email Alerts:** it sends you an email when a stock you're holding reaches a certain level of return. You can use this to notify you about e.g. when to sell, when to buy more, for updates etc. 
3. **Live Portfolio Overview:** it provides an overview with live breakdowns of prices, gains, losses etc. This is the part that u/AnotherDullUsername created, please [see their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cpu1j7/ive_recently_got_into_stocks_and_created_a/) for more info on how to use this part of the spreadsheet.

  
**LINK TO THE DOCUMENT**  
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yS26o6VA12Ry7aZVzObQ7LhyD4uRznNcdOgVzpkSwFQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yS26o6VA12Ry7aZVzObQ7LhyD4uRznNcdOgVzpkSwFQ/edit?usp=sharing)

  
**HOW TO USE THE SPREADSHEET:**

I've made instructions for the 2 main features (portfolio optimisation and email alerts) that I added to the spreadsheet.

1. 'Make a copy' of the spreadsheet to use it.
2. [**Optimal Portfolio Instructions**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vjRj3RzqCF44S9txmQwcp4gLTgsiHeo0Wj0Ox0WiW-4/edit?usp=sharing)
3. [**Email Alert Instructions**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cbr60isKWouA0y-alByTX7fkFoXMAIcH4gkhhGu0qpI/edit?usp=sharing)
4. Please see u/AnotherDullUsername's [post for instructions on how to use the 'Stocks' sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cpu1j7/ive_recently_got_into_stocks_and_created_a/). I have added sections for 'Dividends and Distributions' and 'ETCs' which work in the same way as the features explained in their post, and I have also added sections for 'Email Alert at Earnings %', 'Optimal Portfolio Weight' which are explained in the instructions documents.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK?**

**Portfolio Optimisation Tool:**   
The spreadsheet uses [Modern Portfolio Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp), to conduct 'Markowitz' analysis of a portfolio of stocks. This theory is based on two main concepts:

1. Investors maximise return for any level of risk
2. Risk can be reduced by diversification of assets

You conduct this analysis using the Google Sheets ‘XLMiner Analysis ToolPak’ and 'Solver' add-ons. Using some constraints, the solver function then outputs values for mean (return), standard deviation (risk), and slope (sharpe ratio - how optimised it is.)

**Automatic Email Alerts:**   
Using some very basic code in Google Script (I'm trying to learn to code if anyone has any suggestions on how to learn I would love to hear it), the spreadsheet sends out email alerts when a stock reaches a certain level of returns. Think of them as sort of stop loss or stop limit functions, except they don't execute they just notify you when a stock has reached that level.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTES:**

The 'Portfolio Optimisation Tool' sheet is not just for shares! You can include ETFs, ETCs etc. in you analysis, just have to download the data and input it into the respective sheets - follow the instructions.

The document has the 'Portfolio' sheet in GBP, EUR, USD, NZD but if you need the 'Portfolio' sheet in another currency then duplicate any of the 'Portfolio' sheets, select the columns formatted in currency except for the current price column, go to format&gt;number&gt;more formats&gt;more currencies and select your currency.

I have spoken to u/AnotherDullUsername about making this joint post.

If you have any questions please ask!

If you have any suggestions please say!

Similary to what u/AnotherDullUsername said, the shares in this document are just examples, it is not what I own. Be aware of any possible mistakes the sheet may contain.

Founded by two brothers, one of which was a rocket scientist and the other was a manufacturing expert, the company is a disrupter in the fast growing “bed in a box” mattress category with a highly differentiated product. Its edge is a patented slab of gel-like material called Hyper-Elastic Polymer that is reportedly unlike anything you’ve seen on a mattress. It’s simultaneously soft and firm and feels more like gel than foam.  Spreading pressure, it cradles your shoulders and hips while exerting upward pressure and support for your lower back.

Purple has grown from nothing to generate annual revenues of $300 million in just three years using word of mouth and a highly successful social media campaign on youtube to promote its innovative product.  It now ranks as second in the “bed in a box” category behind privately held Casper Sleep but with a total addressable market for mattresses estimated at $20 billion in the US and $30 billion globally it still has a long runway for growth ahead of it. 

Despite such an encouraging story, the company has an incredibly low valuation, priced on just 1.1x revenues and 4.0x expected 2019 earnings.  This may be partially because Purple is a small cap stock with little coverage by analysts and, with its founders holding approximately 80% of stock, it has a tiny free float which prevents many institutions from holding shares.  

However, the large insider holding should be considered to be a vote of confidence in this fast growing company that, even after a 13% increase this week, trades at a considerable discount to the market.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everybody. Purple Innovation is a high risk small cap stock.

They have significant FCF compared to their industry (they're in the 89th Percentile according to Fidelity) which means they're healthy financially.

Yet, reviewing the big boy's portfolios - Buffet, Soros, Icahn and others, I'm not seeing any positions in this.  What gives? Is this company any more at risk for credit delinquencies affecting its bottom line?  I wouldn't think so given its diversification in banking services.

Now hear me out, lets take an average of 7% total returns from investing in VTI for a year. The amount we had to invest was $1,000. Put the money in Jan 1st and Dec 31 we have a total return of $1,070. 

There are several swings of this stock in price of $5 to $10 happening multiple times over the past 6 months. 

Why couldn't I buy in on a dip, say when RSI is low and set a profit target of $2 / $3 and then set a trailing stop loss? Do this 3 times and I could earn $70 and invest other places instead of riding out the dips. 

What if I'm wrong and stock goes South?

Great question. I've thought about this and would only try this with blue chip or high market cap funds (10b?) or above. Reason being, if I'm wrong I can just stay invested. Set a limit sell order and forget about it. When my target sell price is reached, and stock is sold, i'll have that capital to invest with again.

People invest in blue chip stocks when they're ""on sale"" so I don't see how me riding the wave up and selling for profit is any different. Unless a blue chip just happens to go out of business and I miss the entry point, its just a matter of how much time it takes to reach the profit goal of $2 or whatever the target is.

TQQQ was mentioned by another user earlier. And they were basically wondering why they shouldn't invest in this highly volatile 3x leveraged ETF. I wanted to expand on that thought. 

Now, I don't plan to get invested until the market peaks again which should happen at least once more before the next recession. At that point, I plan to invest heavily in SQQQ. Not for an intra-day trade, but to hold for at least the short-term. I don't touch it again until we're clearly well into the recession. Now, as a quick note, I will be more cautious and probably sell ""early"" on SQQQ to make sure I don't get hurt too badly once the market recovers. There's no timing the market perfectly so I won't get too greedy. 

So my SQQQ shares are sold during the recession. I assume for a decent return since I bought when the market last peaked. Then, I take that money and invest it into TQQQ. Now, this will require a lot more patience as I realize that there's no timing a recession. But I'm 26 years old and any money I have invested I do not need immediate access to this money. 

At that point, I mostly just hold. Now, I may do some occasional sell-offs as the market peaks again in the future. But these 2 stocks seem to be an incredible way to make money. Every article and my financial advisor talk about these as if they're only good for intraday trading because of their volatility. 

But as an example, let's say I decided to invest in TQQQ in 2015 or 2016. And let's say I have terrible timing and invested at around the high price of that year. That was about $20. Now, let's say I had planned to buy and hold, but totally panicked and sold during December of 2018. It had dropped down to $30 at that time. I STILL would've had a 50% increase in less than 5 years. 

Am I missing something? As long as I'm not reactionary and don't sell off in a panic, these seem like the best stocks to get a great ROI. 

Their volatility doesn't worry me as I've got a lot of time to spend investing over the years. If I'm not worried about volatility aren't we nearing a point where SQQQ is a great investment? And then once we're into the recession, isn't TQQQ a smart investment?

He managed to cut active management fees from 1%+ to a 10th of a percent to give better returns to the average investor whom lacks skill or doesn't have the time for individual stock selections.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&gt;If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target to temper economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a lower federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity. 


&gt;The federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,394391,public,self,Non-FUD view of the recession and why its coming.,0,1566255810,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cr3b2o/nonfud_view_of_the_recession_and_why_its_coming/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,

The contentious federal suit began in 2017. Sanofi revealed the $11.7 billion damages claim in a recent filing issued in response to Mylan’s motion for summary judgment to dismiss the case.

The figure is based on estimated lost profits during Auvi-Q’s first brief appearance on the market plus lost profits for the time since – $3.9 billion total – with antitrust law triple damages applied.

“This is a classic antitrust case,” Sanofi said, “involving a monopolist driving its competitor out of the market through anticompetitive conduct for no legitimate business reason other than to maintain its monopoly power.”

Mylan supplied this statement to The Dominion Post regarding Sanofi’s latest move: “Mylan has moved to dismiss Sanofi’s case regarding EpiPen Auto-Injector. In response, Sanofi filed a brief on Friday, Aug. 9, which uses highly inflammatory language and relies on irrelevant evidence in an attempt to support a legally indefensible case and exorbitant and speculative damages claims.

“Mylan continues to believe that Sanofi’s claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously. The company will file its reply to Sanofi’s brief on Aug. 30.”

More than 1,800 documents have been filed in the case since it opened in April 2017. Many are heavily redacted and more recent filings delve deep into the legal weeds. Here is a broad overview.

EpiPen and Auvi-Q are both epinephrine auto-injectors, abbreviated EAIs throughout the suit. EpiPen was launched in 1980; Mylan began marketing it in the U.S. in 2007.

French firm Sanofi launched the Auvi-Q in 2013. Unlike the tube-shaped EpiPen, the Auvi-Q is about the width and length of a credit card and as thick as a cell phone. Mylan officials had previously said that the EpiPen had an 85 percent market share through most of 2015.

Sanofi recalled the product and took it off the market in November 2105 because of technical problems with the dosage system. When Sanofi withdrew Auvi-Q, EpiPen’s share reached 95 percent.

In 2016, Sanofi returned Auvi-Q’s rights to developer kaléo, which brought it back to market in February 2017.

In the suit, Sanofi said its EAI was “designed for the smartphone generation to be smaller and easier to carry than the EpiPen.” It also included built-in voice instructions for use. It quickly gained traction in the marketplace.

In response, Sanofi alleged, Mylan erected multiple artificial barriers to stifle competition:

— Mylan offered steep rebates – 30% or more – to commercial insurers, pharmaceutical benefits managers and states (together called third-party payors) on the condition they do not reimburse for Auvi-Q prescriptions. With ripple effects on doctors, patients and caregivers, Auvi-Q was effectively shut out of more than 50 percent of the market.

— Mylan misclassified its EpiPen to federal and state Medicaid agencies, allowing it to under-reimburse those agencies for EpiPen sales and use the savings to fund its third-party payor rebate scheme.

— Mylan locked competitors out of schools by conditioning its EpiPen4Schools program on exclusive use of EpiPens (a requirement later withdrawn). Mylan spent $4 million lobbying Congress to pass the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act and at least $1 million more lobbying states. One major cheerleader was Gayle Manchin, mother of Mylan CEO Heather Bresch.

— When Auvi-Q hit the market, Mylan jacked up the EpiPen price, which also jacked up the available third-party payor rebate; while Sanofi had its own rebate program, it couldn’t match Mylan’s discount without losing money on each sale, so it was effectively locked out. Payors told Sanofi Mylan’s rebate exceeded Auvi-Q’s total projected sales.

— Mylan used its efforts to keep payors from covering Auvi-Qs as the source for a campaign to highlight that payors weren’t covering Auvi-Qs, harming Auvi-Q’s reputation and perception.

Because of those barriers, and some others, Sanofi said, its U.S. market share fell from 13% at the end of 2103 to just 7% in 2014.

Sanofi said Mylan’s annual EpiPen revenue topped $1 billion starting in 2013. “Thus Mylan had a strong economic motive to undertake the anticompetitive conduct … to protect its crown jewel branded drug project by all means necessary.”

Mylan filed its own counterclaims, alleging Sanofi was the one to engage in anticompetitive conduct.

In the counterclaim, it noted that when it acquired the EpiPen in 2007, there was little awareness of anaphylaxis risk and doctors often prescribed ineffective products to address allergic reactions. Mylan spent millions education the medical community and the public, and making the EpiPen available to schools.

But Sanofi undertook a campaign to besmirch the EpiPen and mislead the healthcare community and the public, Mylan said:

— Sanofi falsely advertised the Auvi-Q as the “new EpiPen,” more patient friendly, safer, easier to carry and use. Its agents allowed some providers to infer that EpiPen was phasing out of the market.

— Auvi-Q sales staff sometimes threw away EpiPen materials in medical offices and replaced it with their own.

— At least one sales staffer offered providers cash kickbacks for prescribing Auvi-Qs. This staffer was not fired, but transferred, implying Sanofi approved of the conduct, and the conduct was more widespread.

“Mylan Specialty suffered, and continues to suffer, harm to its brand image and reputation due to Sanofi’s willingness to engage in illegal activities” to build the Auvi-Q customer base at Mylan’s expense.

Some people seem to think that the economy MUST go south because they *believe* markets have gone up too much (or they are just late to the game and don't want to buy on ATH..).

On the topic of believing, I am long, positive and hopeful. But I don't ignore hard data.

Now, I thought it could be healthy to have a discussion about it based on actual data.

Here's a spreadsheet that I made: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18A8gdTJl3nOPRWjTqsJzH4zgV8cOfunwKkQ7zmH2eVU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18A8gdTJl3nOPRWjTqsJzH4zgV8cOfunwKkQ7zmH2eVU/edit?usp=sharing)

Let's talk about it.

**Yield Curve -** This is mostly what has spooked the market and if you look at history, rightfully so. 

&gt;The term yield curve refers to the relationship between the short- and long-term interest rates of fixed-income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates.

The 10Y Treasury has gone below the 3M Treasury. When investors (that's ""us"") buy long Treasury bonds because we believe they offer a safe harbor and as a result of the rotation to long maturities, yields can fall below short-term rates, forming an inverted yield curve. Since 1956, equities have peaked six times after the start of an inversion, and **the economy has fallen into recession within seven to 24 months.**

**Stock Market Capitalization to GDP for United States** \- This is also referred to as the Buffet Indicator. 

&gt; probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. - Warren Buffet

We are at \~138.5% right now. That's higher than around the financial crisis of 2008 and above the 20 year average (and mean).  The US stock market is positioned for an average annualized return of **-1.5%**, estimated from the historical valuations of the stock market. This includes the returns from the dividends, currently yielding at 1.91%. 

If we look at the same numbers for China and Germany (two other large economies) they do not provide the same picture, but who cares? if US falls, the rest comes down with it... and anyway, they are both higher than their 20Y avg. and mean.

**Tobin's Q** \- It has a lot of uses, but in this case it shows the value of the stock market divided by the corporate net worth. 

A Q between 0 and 1 means that the stock market is undervalued, and above 1 overvalued. Currently we're at 1.142 and was at 0.7668 on the date of the 2008 crisis.

**Other predictors** \- in the spreadsheet, you will find a bunch of other KPIs and when I look at them I can't say that I am worried for them as standalone. They are all looking good, but as the ""heavy"" predictors points to a recession it makes me think that right now we are all just happily unaware. 

Again, I'm a bullish guy when it comes to stocks and markets but looking at say PS, PB, PE etc. it looks a bit overvalued, add to that the above discussed and it does actually look a bit shaky.

Then again, after a yield curve inversion, history has showed that the markets go down within months. And those months, could be several, and several can turn into years. Will I take home profit now and stand outside the market? A market that could possibly keep rising for another 2 years? No.

But I will be more careful about what I  invest in or where take larger positions. I will make sure that I keep some recession-resilient positions as diversification and that I have cash in hand for WHEN the market goes south, so I can find valuable companies to a lower price at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's discuss - Do you agree or disagree? why? What's your strategy? Am I wrong here and if so why?**

&amp;#x200B;

There may be errors or perhaps I've missed something, then feel free to point that out. I can be lazy, give me a break.

Social media platforms go three ways... They either have a blockbuster like decline: Vine, Tumblr. They become incredibly large and begin buying other platforms: Facebook. Or they get bought and thrive under the unbrella: Instagram

Since the start of 2019, Snapchat has grown its userbase to 200million people, but still in my mind isn't a provenly safe stock investment for the coming years.

Being a social media company, it has still potential to rise during the current trade war between the US and China, and being an American company it'll be affected minimally by the Brexit drama, especially compared to other American companies like Amazon.

In a years time do you think Snapchat may drop value again, or do you think it will continue to grow strong, independently of a takeover by a larger organisation?

Short term all I'm hoping to do is make something upto a £50 profit, over a safe period. But as you can tell I'm not very confident in it.

I've been following IRDM since it was around $9. I wish I had some significant capital to invest at that time, but I'm just getting to that point now. With today's red market, I was hungry to buy in and looking at a few big losers so far. AMD was down about 7%, but IRDM was pacing it. The chip sector seems heavily invested in China though, with this year's tariff drama causing a ton of volatility. I don't know how much of this directly impacts IRDM as they are a communications satellite company that is primarily dependent on American investment. Satellite coms has too many uses to be dramatically effected by the tariff drama, so I jumped on IRDM around 21.50 hoping to hold for atleast a 25% return. Most satellite coms companies are limited to government investment, but their constellation project is on track to service consumers around the globe. The company was boosted by an early contract with SpaceX and could see future partnerships with even lower cost launch investment (thanks to reusable rockets).

I bought in way down at $5/Share and have been gradually increasing my stake all the way through $8/Share, reveling in Vivint's excellent performance over the last 5 or 6 months until it's peak at about $9.30. But last week's earnings statement really seemed to cool VSLR's jets. Do you folks think it's still too early to say what direction $VSLR will head over the next couple months, or do you think the current price of about $7.50 is the perfect time to buy? I've also recently purchased shares of $PEGI and $TERP, influenced by their affordability and friendly dividends. Maybe I should pump the brakes on $VSLR and continue increasing my exposure to energy providers instead, what do you guys think?

Another interesting background bit is despite the disappointing earnings statement, people have been purchasing 10x the average amount of $VSLR calls this week (over 2,000 / day vs the usual ~200), and on the day of the earnings statement (8/9), Oppenheimer gave a buy rating and set an $11 price target. On the same day, BoA boosted their price target from $12.50 to $14. Obviously, sentiment is positive and hype is building despite losses being greater than expections last quarter. Putting all of this together, I interpret the situation as the current value being a temporary hiccup, but I'm having trouble telling how much longer until the price recovers or if there's further falling to be done beforehand.

&gt;Based on my in-depth analysis my projection is that Investview soon could be reporting the financials, including the revenue growth rates and profit margins to support a market cap of $1 billion and a share price of $0.37 by end of 2020.  The company now has the products and the infrastructure to support a six-fold increase to 100,000 or more distributors. Assuming that the company produces the financial results to support a billion-dollar market cap by the middle of 2020, the value of Investview could potentially get to $5 billion and a share price of $1.50 by 2025.  Should subsidiaries SAFETek and Safe Management gain traction over the next few months the share price could go to a new two year high by the end of 2019. ",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,392988,public,self,Big news out for $INVU - Signs letter of intent (LOI) for a Micro-Investing App - Company reports higher than expected revenues (32million).,0,1565875483,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cq9mmp/big_news_out_for_invu_signs_letter_of_intent_loi/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm an incoming senior in college and am about to enter the ""real world,"" in one more year. I have to be completely honest with myself, and after doing really well in High School and getting into a really good business school, I didn't do myself justice and try as hard as I should have. By no means am I failing and doing ""bad"" in school, but I am also not in the position to work at a really really good company that most kids at my school end up working at ex. Goldman, Deloitte, PWC, etc. Hopefully, I can somehow change that this last year by mainly building my resumé, but I'm trying to be realistic with myself at this point.

Now after 2-3 years of saying to myself that ""I'm gonna grind and work hard and be successful,"" I'm actually ready to own up and take initiative. It was hard for me to accept at the beginning that I just wasn't giving effort so I blamed things like school taking too much time, stuff like that. My friend and I wanted to start a Shopify business, but I never gave it the effort I should have. (Am thinking about doing that this year as well). But now as cliché as it sounds, I really want to turn my life around. Keep in mind I'm 21 (just turned in June). I know I am young and have a lot of time to learn, I really want to get a head start and stop being a ""talker."" I think owning up to it is a good start. I feel like I have the motivation I need now more than ever to actually take action. I've never really wanted to work at a large company ever in my life, but I know I need a good job while I gain knowledge about investing. Sooner or later I want to make this my living along with some ambitions I have like franchising, hotels, things like that. (I know I'm all over the place).

Now the main reason for this post. I just wanted some advice for those of you who started at this age or even started later and balanced learning with work-life, social-life, etc. Keep in mind I've just been saying to myself that I want to learn about investing, stocks, day trading and never have really gone out of my way to learn other than saving a couple of pages in my bookmarks. But I want and will change that. I just want to know where to start (I have a general idea just seeing if you guys had any suggestions) and how to balance learning with the things I stated before. The biggest regret I have is not starting Freshman year of college where I actually had time to devote to this, and I'm worried I'm not gonna have the time needed to do everything I want to do. I've actually been pretty down on myself this summer and feel like I'm wasting my life away by not giving it my all. I've heard the whole ""you gotta grind and say no to going out and having fun,"" which I am completely willing and able to do. I was thinking of going ""full send"" and waking up early at like 5 am before classes, learning, and spending time at night as well. I just wanted some insight from those of you who were in the same shoes as me. How did you guys start? And how did you learn to balance this with school (I want to start this year) and work (next year yikes)?

Of the company’s variety of offerings, which includes video, Internet, voice, enterprise solutions, and other services, the firm’s primary channels of revenue are through its residential video and Internet services, which, combined, contributed over 74% of the firm’s revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. While the company’s commercial services are important, this analysis focuses on the residential part of Charter’s operations due to the disproportionate amount of revenue that is generated therein.

The traditional competitors to Charter in its cable video offerings include other cable operators such as Comcast and Verizon as well as satellite television providers, including AT&amp;T and Dish Network. Charter, itself, following its acquisitions in 2016, identified its own peer group as containing: Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Spring, Time Warner Inc., Viacom, Dish Network Corporation, CenturyLink, and a few other, less notable and/or comparable companies. In both the cable video and Internet industries, Charter competes as a cost-leader, whereas other companies, such as Verizon, compete on quality and differentiation.

The cable provider industry sells access to video content generally on a subscription basis, frequently bundling video services with other, related services including Internet and voice: 59% of Charter’s customers subscribe to a bundled package of the company’s services. Cable and satellite television services, has witnessed a substantial dip in subscribers in recent years, with a nearly 1.5 million net customer loss in 2017. This trend of “cord-cutters” is being driven by demographic changes, shifting consumer preferences, and by substitute products from new market entrants. Pay-TV penetration has fallen from 88% to 79% since 2010.

Younger consumers are not reliable cable customers: 65% of consumers from 18 to 29 years old subscribe which pales in comparison to the 83.0% of consumers over 50 years old that subscribe. While this may be, in part, due to the relative levels of disposable income between these two customer segments, it very well could be attributable to the other, perhaps more threatening, trend of new market entrants taking away market share. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and other streaming services threaten to capture market share from incumbents in the subscription TV industry. These streaming alternatives not only offer packages that are more finely tailored to the desires of the individual customer, but they are substantially cheaper than cable TV packages. At $35 per month, YouTubeTV significantly undercuts Charter, which tries to act as a cost leader. This trend of lower-cost alternatives entering the market is more problematic for Charter, as a cost leader, than for firms that offer a differentiated product. If Charter’s only selling-point is its lower cost relative to the industry, they have no competitive advantage if they are undercut.


Another trend within the industry is the increasing cost of content. Which content a cable provider offers is extremely important to how well they are able to attract new customers and reduce the churn of their existing client base. 21% of consumers report having signed up for a streaming service for access to a specific show. This number is even higher for younger consumers, who will become an increasingly important source of revenue for the coming years. Again, as a low cost provider, the company is only able to pass on the increasing price of content so much before consumers will move elsewhere with their money.

Charter is a highly leveraged company, with a debt ratio of 46.5% and net debt to EBITDA of 4.53 at the end of FY17. Charter recognizes that it “[has] a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect [the company’s] financial health and [its] ability to react to changes in [its] business”. Among the most important implications of the company’s debt are the fact that the interest and principal payments detract, in a significant way, from the firm’s funds available for capital expenditures and changes in the business. This is especially critical for Charter given the industry trends of technological innovation, increasing content costs, and the high capital intensity of the broadband industry. The dire nature of the firm’s current position can be seen by its EBIT-to-interest coverage ratio, which is 1.33 for 2017. This means that the firm only generated enough earnings through operations to pay off its interest obligations 1.33 times. This ratio is dangerously close to 1.0, below which the firm would be unable to pay off its interest payments purely through income from operations.


While other, potentially more lucrative, short opportunities might be out there, Charter could be a good company to bet against in the mid-to-long term based on your macro outlook. If you’re bearish on the market as a whole, Charter is significant and dependent enough to be dragged down with the market, while offering very limited idiosyncratic upside potential. The company has already revealed a propensity for rapid, significant shifts in its stock price from ~$390 at the beginning of 2/18 to $260 at the end of 3/18.

**HIGH DIVIDENDS DO NOT EQUAL HIGH PERFORMANCE** 
- - -
Companies that pay high dividend yields are either sitting on heavy amounts of cash (Ford, AT&amp;T, Etc) or are up shits creek with no paddle and need an incentive for investors to buy stock. Any non-blue chip stock with a high dividend yield will most likely have negative returns if you see the historical performance. This will positively correlate with an increase in dividend payout as the company tries to keep investors happy by paying them a percent of the returns, and to hide the fact that those returns are actually diminishing. 20% of a $67 share is less than 20% of a $58 share. 

The best analogy to describe this scenario would be ""Bread and Circuses"". Otherwise known as superficial appeasement. 

&gt; The phrase means to generate public approval, not by excellence in public service or public policy, but by diversion, distraction or by satisfying the most immediate or base requirements of a populace — by offering a palliative: for example food (bread) or entertainment (circuses).

Companies use high dividends to distract from the low performance. To see this in action, use the [stock screener on Finviz.com](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx) and filter/sort by highest dividend yield. 

You will find many ""dividend etfs"". ETFs and REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are the safest way of investing for dividends. Individual companies with &gt;10% dividends are, 90% of the time, following the practice I described above. Take $AM for example. The [Anetero Midstream Corporation](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AM&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1) is paying 17% dividend. Meanwhile, if you look at everything but that, you'll find it is a complete mess of a company: 

* Down almost 70% from $22 a share in early 2018 to just $7.22 a share as of today, with no sign of stopping its plummet

* 7 downgrades in the last year, no upgraded reiterations

* Price to Sales is 12.50 

Meanwhile they've continued to raise dividend payouts since its founding in 2013. Its a sinking ship and your dividend payouts will become worthless as it continues to fall in value.

**GUYANA GOLDSTRIKE ANNOUNCES PHASE TWO EXPLORATION PROGRAM OF DRILLING, TRENCHING AND GEOPHYSICS AT MARUDI GOLD PROJECT, GUYANA**

&amp;#x200B;

Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (**GYA.V / GYNAF / 1ZT**) has provided an update from its continuing exploration program at its 13,500-acre (54 square kilometres) Marudi gold project, located within the prospective and prolific Guiana Shield of South America.

With the anticipated end of the rainy reason in late August, the Company plans to resume its exploration program with the commencement of Phase Two.

Highlights of 2019-20 Planned Phase Two Exploration Program

\- Diamond drilling of up to 2,500 metres at the newly discovered Toucan Ridge zone and other targeted areas that have been identified by geophysics, trenching and outcrops

\- 7 priority areas of interest - Marudi Spur Ridge, Peace Creek, July Creek, Success Creek, Kimberley Ridge, East Marudi, and Marudi North West extension areas are to be explored by mapping, sampling and trenching

\- The Company will focus its initial trenching at Kimberley Ridge and Success Creek with the intention of generating new drill target areas

\- The Company will commission a 3D geophysical interpretation west of the Mazoa Hill zone, which includes the target areas: Pancake, Kimberley Ridge, and Success Creek

\- The Company plans to re-log and re-sample historic drill core from Mazoa Hill and Marudi North areas to standardize a new data base

\- Upon initial success from trenching and drilling the Company may elect to increase its diamond drilling program beyond 2,500 metres

Highlights of Completed Phase One Exploration Program 2018-19

\- The Company explored and evaluated 4 of 11 identified areas of interest for gold mineralization mainly in the central area of the Property comprising approximately 15 % of the total Property area. The areas explored to date were Paunch, Pancake, Marudi North (west extension), and Toucan Ridge

\- The Toucan Ridge mineralized zone (750 x 750 metres) was discovered along a 1.75 km area of interest

\- Phase One consisted of a total of 18 trenches representing over 2,500 metres

\- Over 850 assays samples were collected and sent to Act Labs for processing with results received

\- Please see the ""Table of Significant Gold Assay Results To Date"" below

\- A 250 metre length of quartzite-metachert (host rock) discovery was identified that extends to the southeast from the Toucan Ridge area

\- A second discovery of quartzite-metachert northeast of Toucan Ridge at East Marudi was identified approximately 2,300 metres northeast of trench TTR-18-06

\- A geophysical survey of the entire Property was completed by helicopter with 1,201-line km of flight lines covering 13,500 acres (54 sq. km) at 50 metre line spacing

\- An independent geophysical report was completed analyzing the magnetic and radiometric data

\- 16 anomalous 2D magnetic targets were identified and selected based on their strong magnetic susceptibility response, linear trend, and topographic highs

\- 5 anomalous 3D magnetic targets were selected based on favorable quartzite - metachert host rock association for continued exploration

\- A 5 km anomalous magnetic trend was identified at the Mazoa Hill zone that hosts the 43-101 compliant resource estimate and is less than 10% drilled

Locke Goldsmith M Sc. P Eng. P Geo., VP Exploration stated,

""we are very pleased with the results and accomplishments of last year's Phase One exploration. I am encouraged that the geophysical survey interpretation shows the existence of 21 magnetic anomalies on our Property. The Company looks forward to Phase Two exploration which will focus on these anomalous areas including additional trenching and geophysical interpretation of new targets not yet explored. Most importantly, we look forward to drilling the newly discovered Toucan Ridge mineralized zone as this represents our highest priority targets for confirmation diamond drilling at depth.""

Completion of Phase Two Program

Completion of Phase Two is subject to the availability of capital on terms acceptable to the Company.

Mineral Resource Estimates from the Mazoa Hill Zone

The Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. The Toucan Ridge area is located approximately one kilometre north of the Mazoa Hill zone. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open at depth and to the southeast. Mazoa Hill zone mineral resource estimates:

\- 259,100 indicated gold ounces within 4,428,000 tonnes grading 1.80 g/t;

\- 86,200 inferred gold ounces within 1,653,000 tonnes grading 1.60 g/t

For further information regarding the resource estimates, readers are encouraged to review the technical report "" Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate "", available under the Company's profile on SEDAR.

About the Marudi Gold Project

The Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project located in Guyana, South America. The project has an 18-year mining license, all-season road access, infrastructure in place, with an established camp. The Property has three known gold bearing areas: the alluvial areas, the saprolite, and the underlying hard-rock.

is it the same ""game"" like picking up girls on the streets? those videos were hot a years ago and then the truth came out (girls were paid to cooperate) so are those incredible youtube stories just a trick to get you buy ""the next best seminar about stock market"" or is the success like that real when people study stock market? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just thinking how many of you are even doing at least 100% (doubling) money in a year? because some of the comments here are really PRO and written by people who really know what they are saying..

1. Their second quarter revenue is [$31.47 million](http://thedeepdive.ca/medipharm-labs-reports-revenues-of-31-million-for-second-quarter/). They are currently one of the only profitable cannabis companies (in Canada).
2. The company made a deal with Scotiabank for [$60 million](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/medipharm-labs-raises-60-million-selling-stock-at-5-55/) in liquid cash. They dropped the stock price down to $5.55 a share for the bank. With the $60 million they received the cash is being used to expand and upgrade their facilities in Canada and Australia. 
3. Edibles in Canada become available [mid December 2019](https://www.leafly.ca/news/politics/edibles-health-canada-announcement-jun-14). Why is this so important for this company? Medipharm Labs does not grow any cannabis but instead they have cornered the market by focusing solely on extracting oil from the cannabis flower. The oil itself is what is used to make the edible products and as other companies are trying to ramp up production of their edibles I could see a very large increase in business for Medipharm.   


Once the edible market has been established I believe that would be the best time to sell as more cannabis companies are looking to do their own extraction in house.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Spirit Airlines is a small, but steadily growing ultra-low-cost airline that capitalized early on this trend by introducing ""bare fares"" and ""no frill"" flights, offering relatively cheap base rates for tickets, but charging extra for almost everything else, from choosing seats to bottles of water, essentially unbundling the services that a traditional airline would have included in the price of a normal ticket. Today, we are going to analyze the airline industry, as well as Spirit\'s operating efficiency, growth, risks, and valuation to ultimately decide whether or not it makes sense to be a shareholder of the underdog airline. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.\n\n###The airline industry\n\nUntil recently, airlines were notoriously unprofitable businesses. Fierce competition led to aggressive price cutting, with many airlines losing money on each flight, resulting in massive losses industry-wide. Between 1977 to 2009, the sector suffered combined losses of over $52 billion. However, recent bankruptcies and mergers consolidated the industry, leading to increases in capacity, operating efficiency and overall profitability. In fact, Warren Buffett, who had once called airlines ""a death trap for investors"", now owns a stake in all of the big four U.S airlines: American, United, Delta and Southwest. The big four currently dominate the U.S domestic airline industry, with almost 70% combined market share.\n\nIn spite of its history, 2018 marked the 10th consecutive year of profitability for U.S airline industry. Capacity has grown at an average rate of 2.5% each year since 2009, and major U.S airlines carry over 17% more passengers than they did 10 years ago. The industry is expected to continue growing, with the U.S Federal Aviation Administration forecasting a 1.9% average annual growth in passengers over the next two decades.\n\nOperating efficiency is key in the airline business. Airlines run at relatively low margins, so modest increases in unit revenues or decreases in unit costs can tremendously affect overall profitability. For example, the expenses of scheduled flights do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried. Whether a flight is at full capacity or half capacity, the airline will incur similar labor, fuel and other costs. Therefore, on the revenue side, a slight increase in load factor (the percentage of aircraft seats actually occupied on a flight) may significantly improve the overall profitability of a flight. Similarly, on the cost side, a slight percentage increase in fuel costs could have a materially negative effect on an airline\'s operating profits.\n\nLabor and fuel costs disproportionately represent overall airline expenses. In 2018, labor and fuel represented approximately 24% and 32% of Spirit\'s operating expenses respectively. Therefore, an airline\'s operating efficiency depends highly on its ability to bargain effectively with its labor unions, as well as the pricing and availability of aircraft fuel. Some airlines manage fuel price volatility risk through derivative contracts. Others choose to pay market rates over long periods of time as a form of natural hedging, letting the occasional high price average out the occasional low price.\n\n###Operating Efficiency\n\nAs one would expect, Spirit has relatively low unit revenues, given their cheap ticket prices. However, Spirit also has the lowest unit costs in the United States, and therefore has the advantage of being able to maintain profitability at low prices where its competitors cannot.\n\nSpirit maintains another competitive advantage by operating a single-fleet type of Airbus A320-family aircraft that is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States operated by common flight crews. By operating a single aircraft type, Spirit is able to avoid the costs of training crews across multiple types while also making flight crews interchangeable across all aircraft. Additionally, the average age of an aircraft in Spirit\'s fleet is only 5.4 years, allowing for comparatively low maintenance costs. However, it is expected that these costs will increase as the fleet ages.\n\nIn terms of performance, Spirit has been steadily improving. In 2015, Spirit ranked last among all U.S airlines in on-time arrivals. However, following a management change the following year, Spirit climbed its way to first place in on-time performance in 2018, while continuing to maintain its low costs. Additionally, Spirit\'s cancellation rate improved from 6% in May 2017 to only 0.56% in the same month the following year.\n\n###Growth\n\nAlthough Spirit has been around since the 1960s, it only transitioned into its current business model of ultra-low-cost-carrier in 2007. As a pioneer in the ultra-low-cost-carrier space, Spirit\'s brand reputation has taken a beating over the years for being perceived as excessively stingy (customers were surprised about having to pay for a bottle of water), as well as their poor on-time performance and cancellation rates. However, Spirit\'s brand has seen steady improvement over recent years as customers became more understanding of their business model, and as late/cancellation rates declined due to operating efficiency improvements. As a result, Spirit has more than doubled its share of the U.S domestic market to 4% in the past six years. It has grown its revenues by 72% over the past five years, and plans to continue growing its capacity in the mid-teens over the next several years. Spirit\'s ability to grow its earnings will depend mostly on whether or not it can execute on its capacity growth plans and minimize cancellations, while continuing to manage and reduce costs. Over the next few decades, they may see gains from macroeconomic tailwinds, as the air travel market is expected to grow steadily. Additionally, low-cost-carriers have been consistently growing their share of the total air travel market, and if this trend continues, Spirit would be well-positioned to benefit.\n\n###Risks\n\nSpirit is susceptible to many of the same risks as other airlines, including disruptions or cancellations from unexpected weather problems and other factors beyond Spirit\'s control, rising oil prices and other variable costs, as well as other macroeconomic issues such as economic downturns. However, most of these issues are short-term in nature, and don\'t pose existential threats to the business. The greatest threat to Spirit\'s business is increased competition from traditional carriers. Beginning 2015, domestic carriers with far more resources than Spirit began to match lower cost airline pricing in order to compete with Spirit and other low-cost airlines. So far, Spirit has been able to hold its ground, continuing to grow its revenues and market share. However, it is uncertain whether or not Spirit can maintain its rate of growth in such a competitive environment.\n\nAdditionally, Spirit\'s assets are almost 70% funded by debt, due to the large upfront costs of purchasing aircrafts. This could put Spirit in a bad position in the event of an economic downturn. However, this is somewhat offset by Spirit\'s strong cash position of $1.22 billion compared to its current liabilities of $1.21 billion, resulting in a cash-ratio of 1.01, which is relatively high compared to other airlines. Over the past several years, Spirit has continued to maintain a strong cash position relative to short-term debt, demonstrating their intention to be prepared in the event of an economic downturn.\n\n###Valuation\n\nThe following discounted future earnings model makes the following assumptions: Spirit\'s earnings will grow at 5% year over year for five years starting July 2019; it will have a price/earnings ratio of 11 at the end of this period; and the investor demands an 11% annualized return during this period. Discounting future earnings under these assumptions, Spirit\'s present value is approximately $3 billion. Its current market capitalization is about $2.8 billion, meaning that the stock is currently undervalued under these assumptions. However, any model is only as good as its inputs, and even a small change in expected earnings growth, terminal price/earnings ratio or discount rate could have a significant impact on the present value. Whether or not you should to invest in Spirit at these prices will depend on your own expected future value and required rate of return.\n\n###Conclusion\n\nDespite being an underdog in the U.S domestic airline market, Spirit is a company with relatively strong fundamentals and solid growth potential. However, Wall Street does not seem to agree with this sentiment. Spirit\'s price/earnings ratio of 8 and price/book value of 1.36 seems to imply very low expectations of growth, despite a history of consistent, moderate growth. If Spirit is able to effectively execute on its growth plans, it may prove to be a very profitable investment at today\'s prices.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a Reuters poll showed that U.S flyers preferred cheap tickets over perks and comfort when traveling. Spirit Airlines is a small, but steadily growing ultra-low-cost airline that capitalized early on this trend by introducing &amp;quot;bare fares&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no frill&amp;quot; flights, offering relatively cheap base rates for tickets, but charging extra for almost everything else, from choosing seats to bottles of water, essentially unbundling the services that a traditional airline would have included in the price of a normal ticket. Today, we are going to analyze the airline industry, as well as Spirit&amp;#39;s operating efficiency, growth, risks, and valuation to ultimately decide whether or not it makes sense to be a shareholder of the underdog airline. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The airline industry&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until recently, airlines were notoriously unprofitable businesses. Fierce competition led to aggressive price cutting, with many airlines losing money on each flight, resulting in massive losses industry-wide. Between 1977 to 2009, the sector suffered combined losses of over $52 billion. However, recent bankruptcies and mergers consolidated the industry, leading to increases in capacity, operating efficiency and overall profitability. In fact, Warren Buffett, who had once called airlines &amp;quot;a death trap for investors&amp;quot;, now owns a stake in all of the big four U.S airlines: American, United, Delta and Southwest. The big four currently dominate the U.S domestic airline industry, with almost 70% combined market share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In spite of its history, 2018 marked the 10th consecutive year of profitability for U.S airline industry. Capacity has grown at an average rate of 2.5% each year since 2009, and major U.S airlines carry over 17% more passengers than they did 10 years ago. The industry is expected to continue growing, with the U.S Federal Aviation Administration forecasting a 1.9% average annual growth in passengers over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Operating efficiency is key in the airline business. Airlines run at relatively low margins, so modest increases in unit revenues or decreases in unit costs can tremendously affect overall profitability. For example, the expenses of scheduled flights do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried. Whether a flight is at full capacity or half capacity, the airline will incur similar labor, fuel and other costs. Therefore, on the revenue side, a slight increase in load factor (the percentage of aircraft seats actually occupied on a flight) may significantly improve the overall profitability of a flight. Similarly, on the cost side, a slight percentage increase in fuel costs could have a materially negative effect on an airline&amp;#39;s operating profits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Labor and fuel costs disproportionately represent overall airline expenses. In 2018, labor and fuel represented approximately 24% and 32% of Spirit&amp;#39;s operating expenses respectively. Therefore, an airline&amp;#39;s operating efficiency depends highly on its ability to bargain effectively with its labor unions, as well as the pricing and availability of aircraft fuel. Some airlines manage fuel price volatility risk through derivative contracts. Others choose to pay market rates over long periods of time as a form of natural hedging, letting the occasional high price average out the occasional low price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Operating Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one would expect, Spirit has relatively low unit revenues, given their cheap ticket prices. However, Spirit also has the lowest unit costs in the United States, and therefore has the advantage of being able to maintain profitability at low prices where its competitors cannot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spirit maintains another competitive advantage by operating a single-fleet type of Airbus A320-family aircraft that is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States operated by common flight crews. By operating a single aircraft type, Spirit is able to avoid the costs of training crews across multiple types while also making flight crews interchangeable across all aircraft. Additionally, the average age of an aircraft in Spirit&amp;#39;s fleet is only 5.4 years, allowing for comparatively low maintenance costs. However, it is expected that these costs will increase as the fleet ages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of performance, Spirit has been steadily improving. In 2015, Spirit ranked last among all U.S airlines in on-time arrivals. However, following a management change the following year, Spirit climbed its way to first place in on-time performance in 2018, while continuing to maintain its low costs. Additionally, Spirit&amp;#39;s cancellation rate improved from 6% in May 2017 to only 0.56% in the same month the following year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Growth&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although Spirit has been around since the 1960s, it only transitioned into its current business model of ultra-low-cost-carrier in 2007. As a pioneer in the ultra-low-cost-carrier space, Spirit&amp;#39;s brand reputation has taken a beating over the years for being perceived as excessively stingy (customers were surprised about having to pay for a bottle of water), as well as their poor on-time performance and cancellation rates. However, Spirit&amp;#39;s brand has seen steady improvement over recent years as customers became more understanding of their business model, and as late/cancellation rates declined due to operating efficiency improvements. As a result, Spirit has more than doubled its share of the U.S domestic market to 4% in the past six years. It has grown its revenues by 72% over the past five years, and plans to continue growing its capacity in the mid-teens over the next several years. Spirit&amp;#39;s ability to grow its earnings will depend mostly on whether or not it can execute on its capacity growth plans and minimize cancellations, while continuing to manage and reduce costs. Over the next few decades, they may see gains from macroeconomic tailwinds, as the air travel market is expected to grow steadily. Additionally, low-cost-carriers have been consistently growing their share of the total air travel market, and if this trend continues, Spirit would be well-positioned to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Risks&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spirit is susceptible to many of the same risks as other airlines, including disruptions or cancellations from unexpected weather problems and other factors beyond Spirit&amp;#39;s control, rising oil prices and other variable costs, as well as other macroeconomic issues such as economic downturns. However, most of these issues are short-term in nature, and don&amp;#39;t pose existential threats to the business. The greatest threat to Spirit&amp;#39;s business is increased competition from traditional carriers. Beginning 2015, domestic carriers with far more resources than Spirit began to match lower cost airline pricing in order to compete with Spirit and other low-cost airlines. So far, Spirit has been able to hold its ground, continuing to grow its revenues and market share. However, it is uncertain whether or not Spirit can maintain its rate of growth in such a competitive environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Spirit&amp;#39;s assets are almost 70% funded by debt, due to the large upfront costs of purchasing aircrafts. This could put Spirit in a bad position in the event of an economic downturn. However, this is somewhat offset by Spirit&amp;#39;s strong cash position of $1.22 billion compared to its current liabilities of $1.21 billion, resulting in a cash-ratio of 1.01, which is relatively high compared to other airlines. Over the past several years, Spirit has continued to maintain a strong cash position relative to short-term debt, demonstrating their intention to be prepared in the event of an economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Valuation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following discounted future earnings model makes the following assumptions: Spirit&amp;#39;s earnings will grow at 5% year over year for five years starting July 2019; it will have a price/earnings ratio of 11 at the end of this period; and the investor demands an 11% annualized return during this period.

Whether or not you should to invest in Spirit at these prices will depend on your own expected future value and required rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite being an underdog in the U.S domestic airline market, Spirit is a company with relatively strong fundamentals and solid growth potential.

Sadly, they've got plenty of investors pouring plenty of money into them already. So who knows how long they wait to go public. However, I was big on $BYND and totally missed the train on that one. Still waiting on it to fall further back to Earth before I'd invest.

That being said, even if the trading is mostly speculative, I'll definitely get in early once Impossible goes public. Anyone disagree? Or who else plans to do the same?

I know this isn't a stock yet so I hope it's okay to post. Just looking forward to investing in a company right after it goes public which I haven't done before.
