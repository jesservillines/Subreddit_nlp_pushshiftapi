Our econ shrank 4.8% in Q1 and that is massive. Probably alarming. It is only going to be similar in Q2

However Fed has done a good job in overnight work and ensuring liquidity is available for banks since the crisis started but I worry they will run out of tools. My next worry is mortgage defaults because job layoffs are continuing despite stimulus from the government for small businesses. 

However good news is that many pharma companies are in drug clinical testing mode and we should have tangible drug therapies by June or July and that is why Q2 will deal a critical blow.

He’s also the co-founder and chairman of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics company and he is a regular columnist at CoinDesk where he writes thoughtfully about the political economy and issues concerning bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. 

As Nic Carter points out during this conversation, Bitcoin is a “subversive idea.” Bitcoin is an experiment in social organization that doesn’t play by the rules of the state or by the conventions of modern society.

In the news everywhere, we have the following:

1. Gilead’s own study withOUT a control group showing 5-day course and 10-day course of Remdesivir showing no difference.

2. An NAIAD study showing that Remdseivir helped patients who were already on the path to recovery to actually recover a few days earlier—but no effect in those succumbing to the disease.

Besides these two results today, a multi-center collaboration in China released the study of an actual randomized, double-blinded study with placebo control. A much more comprehensive, albeit an ever slightly different study goal, study than the two results that American news are flaunting. This other study showed a much different result than what the market is being hyped on today. 

Yet, the news outlets and the market has completely ignored this more comprehensive study. 

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31022-9/fulltext

In case you don’t have time or background to understand the study, here’s the authors’ summary:

Our trial found that intravenous remdesivir did not significantly improve the time to clinical improvement, mortality, or time to clearance of virus in patients with serious COVID-19 compared with placebo. Compared with a previous study of compassionate use of remdesivir, our study population was less ill (eg, at the time of enrolment, 0·4% were on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation vs 64% in the previous study) and was treated somewhat earlier in their disease course (median 10 days vs 12 days). Such differences might be expected to favour remdesivir, providing greater effects in our study population, but our results did not meet this expectation.

The Fed meets later today and, having thrown everything including the kitchen sink to protect the US economy in the battle against the economic damage of this crisis, no action is expected this time. As such, the market reaction may depend mainly on Powell’s remarks. From a risk-management perspective, Powell has more incentive to soothe investors’ nerves and hint that more stimulus is possible, which could briefly hurt the Dollar.

Investors will be hanging from Powell’s every word, eager to find out whether the central bank is willing to do even more if the crisis worsens, or whether policymakers feel they have done enough. For example, would the Fed consider going down the Bank of Japan’s path and introduce yield-curve control? How about buying stocks (though Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was quoted yesterday that this was an unlikely option for the Fed)?

Overall, he is likely to maintain a very cautious tone, and probably keep even these extreme options on the table. Ruling out more stimulus now would risk increasing market volatility, which is the last thing the Fed wants as that could reduce the effectiveness of all its previous actions. Better be safe than sorry, especially in the middle of a recession.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:**

Yet another day of wild swings in the WTI crude oil June future falling almost 30% at one stage before retracing the losses to close slightly positive on the day. The volatility was likely exacerbated by the USO ETF announcing that they would be selling the June future to switch their long positions to contracts further out the calendar. S&amp;P500 slowly crept to test the highs of the day before the open of the US session, and promptly sold off when the US trading hours got fully underway. There seems to be a puzzling trend of risk assets being bought during Asian hours before retracing during NY hours. Seems inexplicable why that is the case, but it’s something to keep an eye on.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,396908,public,confidence,self,Day Ahead and Sentiments for 29th April 2020,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ga45y8/day_ahead_and_sentiments_for_29th_april_2020/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think the US indices are now near the end of the bull trap from the big March fall. I've been watching for this setting up for the last couple weeks (and been a bit early a few times), but this is starting to flash up all the warning signs in the Asia market tonight.

\---

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.

Here is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).

The pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)

In the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)

Individual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)

Later in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).

Individual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)

In the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.

On the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.

April of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).

Today is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000 area could be the end of the bull trap and a huge fall would be due in the months ahead.

Quick question: I have a standard brokerage account, so obviously I don't daytrade/swingtrade or utilize options trading. I buy to sell short or long. At any rate, I sold a stock two days ago and the money went to my ""cash to trade"". Yesterday around 8:30p, I bought shares of another stock. I woke up the next morning to see it was ""rejected"". How could it be rejected when the stocks I bought were within the cash to trade range?? Is there a 2-day waiting period to use cash to trade funds? If this is the case, why would my brokerage firm allow me to see that the cash to trade funds are actually available to use? This is frustrating as I was screwed on gains of this particular stock.

So my question is simple. Does anyone know of any reliable online sources that draw the data from company filings at the SEC and calculate all of the ratios needed to value a stock?
 If this exists, I feel like value investing would be too easy because in theory you would just look up all of the companies that have favorable ratios in their industries and invest in those.

Demetri Kofinas speaks with Eric Peters, CIO of One River Asset Management and author of Weekend Notes about investing in a volatile world where four decades of assumptions about markets, politics, and policy no longer hold.  

We are living through a period of radical uncertainty and disillusionment with institutions and markets that we haven’t seen for a hundred years. International alliances are shifting. National priorities are changing. The role of government in society is growing. The stakes for portfolio managers, politicians, and individuals have never been higher.  

Learning how to navigate the volatility and radical uncertainty of the present moment is the seminal challenge that we face. How we manage that uncertainty in the years to come presents not only a financial challenge but an emotional one as well.

They take they comapre younger working adults to middle age (age 40-65) working adults to try to predict the stock market. The basic theroy is that younger adults(age 20-39) are likely to take out debt and be broke from having kids vs middle age whom would be investing and building their retirement.

Now, i was interested in a different ratio: the **retired population vs the working population**, defined as:

\-working population age 19-64

\-retired popuation 65+

My general thesis is that the working population serves as buyers into the stock market and the retired population serves as eventually sellers in the stock market. And yes, im aware many retiress stay invested, but they stop adding to their accounts and begin to make withdrawals overall. **I'll post the data in the comment section** to make this post easier to read.

In 1950 the ratio is about 10x, meaning there are 10 working class buying stocks for every 1 retiree withdrawaling from stocks. Today that ratio has steadily decreased and to about 6x and will be 3.5x by the time many of you retire.

Food for thought: how many new buyers does it take to replace one seller? Adjusted for inflation, the dow jones has made 1,000% gains since the 1950s, so does it take 10x new buyers to displace a seller with 1,000% return? luckily they are not cashing out 100% and only take out what they need to spend each month.

I think I'll continue my strategy of DCA in index funds divided over a few sectors like tech, consumer goods, energy, industrial and communication. This was my original investment strategy as well but since Corona I've tried some options and buy low sell high. Sometimes worked but definitely a lot more difficult and mentally challenging.

***Scenario 2:***  The market has seen a dead cat bounce and will crash even further than march lows but then quickly pick up again. 

This is what I originally thought would happen during this corona crisis. My strategy here was to buy below a certain price and then just weekly or monthly invest in index funds. After this the market would rise again and get to the ""old"" prices again. 

***Scenario 3:*** We'll see a decline of all the markets without the panic of march sell offs. This would cause us to go into a full time and long recession that'll last for years. Companies go bankrupt after/during the corona crisis and because of the huge printing of money or lending money at banks a lot of countries would have debts. 

I personally think this scenario becomes more likely the more the market moves. I'm not exactly sure what I would do in this scenario because options have no big use when they expire quickly and the markets goes down very slowly over time. Also DCA would be a bit strange because you never know if (after all of this) the world will be the same. After all we've never experienced such a thing in recent times.

Even with recent gains, I still think right now is an absolute tremendous buying opportunity and that this bull market will continue through the next 5-6 years, since it is looking likely for Trump to be re-elected and his low regulation policies are extremely pro business and the market knows that. I think within 2.5 years from now stocks will be 20-30 % higher than the previous highs of a couple months ago. The things Trump will be able to get done for economic growth in his 2nd term, without all the false impeachment’s, etc etc. going on, in my mind the gains will be unmatched. I think within 3 weeks that 85% of the country will be reopen and back to a semi normal state. So even though this Coronavirus has been unprecedented, if it ends soon, economic damage that has been predicted will be “minimized” - relatively speaking. How do others feel about this market prediction as a whole? Investors already know that earnings reports will be bleak, so is that likely to be priced in?

The Fed has thrown everything including the kitchen sink at the US economy in a desperate bid to avoid total catastrophe as the deadly Covid-19 has forced most businesses to go into hibernation.

With kids having been at home and doing ""virtual learning,"" they're playing video games more - I read a report recently that said Verizon was experiencing an increase of 75% in video game usage on their network.  I think this continues. There's an interesting gap going on right now in creative content and video games helps fill the void.  

Looking at Microsoft and Sony in particular - not only are they the leaders in the space (I believe?), but I like the diversity of their businesses as well.  Not just their gaming segments, but the semiconductor, music, pictures, etc. parts.  Their conglomerate structures somewhat hides the value of these separate underlying businesses.

(Bloomberg) -- Stocks climbed as major economies edged toward reopening and policy makers in Japan and Europe sought to reduce pressure on credit markets. The dollar weakened and oil took another dive.

The S&amp;P 500 Index was poised for its highest close since March 10 as financial companies led gains after a surprisingly good earnings report from Deutsche Bank and amid continued talk of easing the lockdowns that have helped contain the coronavirus. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index also rose after Covid-19 deaths slowed in Spain, Italy and France and the countries signaled tentative moves to reopen their economies.

The misery for West Texas oil continued and futures in New York traded near $13 a barrel amid a glut of crude. Treasury yields rose amid a report that European regulators will provide banks with a fourth round of capital relief and as the Bank of Japan ratcheted up its stimulus measures with plans to buy as many government bonds as needed.

With the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 25% since its lows in March but still down more than 10% this year, investors are waiting on a slew of corporate earnings this week and forecasts on what’s to come, with reports due from Amazon.com Inc., Barclays Plc and Samsung Electronics Co. For now, traders are focused on the positive, with all 11 of the S&amp;P 500’s major subgroups gaining on the day.

Stocks held gains throughout the day amid good news on the fight against the pandemic. A coronavirus vaccine could be available as early as this year, according to a coalition funding nine projects. The U.K. reported the lowest daily increase in deaths since March, while Italy reported the fewest new cases in seven weeks. New York recorded 337 deaths, down sharply from daily peaks earlier this month.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,395342,public,confidence,self,Investors have built herd immunity to bad news thanks to the vaccine developed by central banks!,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g986an/investors_have_built_herd_immunity_to_bad_news/,all_ads,6,,,,,1588018745.0,,,,,,,,,

I’m pretty low on funds, so I’ll only be putting $100 or so in every month, at least at first. Also, I was thinking about investing a larger sum at first, while the prices are so low. 

Any advice on how I can best avoid fees and get the best prices?

Also, is there a downside to High Dividend mutual funds that I can’t see? They seem good, but I’m so green.

https://www.twitch.tv/scarypillow  

Made a rudimentary python script to print the tickers of the top gainers and losers approximately over the last minute. I know you can get a lot of this info off scanners, but I just wanted something in real-time that I could adjust the timeframe for. Hopefully you can use this to catch stocks that are unexpectedly mooning like LTRPB a few weeks ago.

Currently have it set to approximately average change over the last minute. The API I get the data from is inconsistent in response time, so it changes. Don't worry about 'score', it just roughly corresponds to the change.

I don't even know how to make money off information. But if you figure out something, please share!

&amp;#x200B;

ANTs have arrived.

&amp;#x200B;

The first-ever actively managed, nontransparent exchange-traded funds, or ANTs, officially began trading last week, a major milestone that some see as a first step to changing the face of the ETF industry.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike traditional ETFs, nontransparent ETFs are not required to disclose their portfolio holdings on a daily basis, a plus for [active managers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/25/the-next-big-thing-in-etfs-could-give-a-boost-to-long-suffering-active-investors.html) worried about getting front-run on their strategies. Instead, some will disclose their holdings monthly or quarterly, while others will point buyers to similarly structured mutual funds or share their holdings without disclosing the exact weightings. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently watched an interview with an ex Goldman Sachs manager, which I’ll link below, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. The idea that the stock market only goes up, according to him, is not true. Japan peaked in the 90s, Europe peaked in 2000, Taiwan and South Korea have been around the same levels for decades, and the US could just be the next to follow. This could disrupt investors’ long term strategies.

Gap Downs: CNXM, ZM

SPY, QQQ, IWM all gapping up pretty significantly pre market. Usually these are the most difficult days to trade. Good thing is that SPY is gapping over the 50 day moving average and has held the prior 272 pivot level from 2019, both good signs. Last weeks action was a bit on the choppy side of things but with so many earnings reports being released this week, maybe we will get some cleaner action. SPY has room to move to around 300 until it runs into the 200 day moving average. We always enter trades with defined risk:reward calculated before hand, this can help eliminate large losses.

I'm really new to investing and I started reading on tips and tricks in minimising loss and maximising returns on the stock market. One of them says that I should look out for candlestick patterns. I was just wondering how reliable are these patterns? In your experience, do these patterns accurately predict a price movement most of the time? 

Finally, do you have any tips for a newcomer such as myself to perhaps become a better investor? I'm looking forward to any sort of input and suggestion but apologise again if this is not the place to ask for advice.

Bank of Japan’s policy meeting will kick off on Monday, but it will not be a usual two-day gathering this time as policymakers are expected to reach their decision the same day. While under other circumstances, such an adjustment would signal an eventful meeting, the current virus situation may pressure the central bank for additional corporate aid and likely some flexibility on government bond purchases, whereas there is no doubt that interest rates will remain steady.

Over the years I've collected tons and tons of market resources ranging from blogs to APIs to technical and fundamental analysis tools to books, videos, YouTube channels and beyond. For a while I've been working on organizing them into something we could share here on the sub to help answer all the ""what are some good resources for learning about the stock market?"" and ""how do I get started in stocks?"" type questions that always pop up across all these stock market subs. 

This is by no means complete, but it's already quite thorough and I'd love your help in adding to it.

I've put it all on GitHub so it can be maintained and others can suggest additions and report broken links if/when they pop up, or make suggestions about order/organization or whatever! I will continue to add to it as I get around to it and come across new resources and rediscover old ones. 

In the mean time, please comment here or feel free to issue a pull request if you know how, if there's anything I should add and I will add it in, or if you notice any broken links or issues! I know that I've missed many things so let me know what they are and we'll make this even bigger/better. In particular it'd be nice if we could categorize the books and create lists for different categories kinda like /r/securityanalysis did in their wiki, but I've added a few as a start. 

Ok that's all! Open discussion, feedback welcome. Let's hear what you got.

RioCan REIT (RIOCF) - I've read REITs that have commercial holdings rather than tenants are more likely to collect rent since the man hours needed to collect rent for tenants is higher (1 retail store compared to a 300 unit apartment building) and the business accounts of retail stores likely have larger cash reserves to weather the COVID-19 downturn compared to the personal accounts of tenants; Riskier investment but pays 10% dividend ratios

Merck (MRK) - Healthcare that pays decent dividends and is currently valued high for the role it's playing in the COVID-19 crisis; very high dividend safety score

NextEra Energy (NEE) - Energy; pays decent dividends; very high dividend safety score

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW) - Finance; Pays good dividends; very high dividend safety score

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM) - Finance; Pays huge dividends with only a 50% payout ratio

AT&amp;T (T) - Communications; Pays huge dividends 60% payout ratio; very high dividend safety score; Dividend growth for the past 35 years

Canada Utilities Limited (CDUAF) - Utilities; I've read utilities companies tend to survive during recessions since people still need them; Good dividends but more risky

Allied Properties (APYRF) - Another REIT; see above

All I can invest right now is $3900. My net worth is ~$7000. I tried to spread the risk around and think this a decent position to get dividends and reinvest.

IMO this probably has much to do with the fact that any old Joe shmoe can trade stocks and options for free right now. Webull, Robinhood, TD, etc....these are all free apps that people are dumping money into and then buying stocks. 

10 years ago I wanted to get started trading before I was even married but to do so would have been much more difficult and costly.

I know 10 people personally that have just started investing in the last month along with me and all I of us combined make up a decent sum of money. One guy already has $25k in and is refinancing his house to dump more in. 

I'm sure this is happening across the nation especially with people stuck at home with no where to spend their time and money.

No they can't. If ANYONE with $1200 cash on their hands knew, they'd be the richest person alive within 28 trades - within hours.

Let's say someone was fully confident that he *knows*. He would put $1000 on binary options (either double your entry or lose everything) and get $2000 in return. He'd do it again to get $4000. Fast forward being right another 26 times and with gains of $268,435,456,000 they would be the richest person alive. You could do that in a single day.

Of course this thought experiment is a simulation that doesn't account for fees, risk-assessment (you'd probably save some on each trade so a loss doesn't result in a total loss) and the fact that no bank on the planet would want to play with billion dollar options (I guess).

The venture fund invested in a range of companies over the years, perhaps most notably of which was their investment in Slack.

In mid-2018, they closed to outside capital and became a technology holding company.

According to Chamath, this decision was made in order to take a more long term approach and avoid the perils of the short term fee generation game that is prevalent in the venture capital industry.

As always, Chamath provides some interesting insights in the [Letter](https://www.socialcapital.com/annual-letters/2019).

**Part 1/5 - Modern Gilded Age:**

First off, Chamath makes the argument that we are currently in the later stages of a modern Gilded Age.

The Gilded Age was an era of rapid economic growth in the United States from the 1870s to around 1900.

During this period there was rapid economic growth, wage growth, immigration and expansion of social programs.

The major industry of growth was the railroads, and a class division started to emerge with the 1% owning more than 25% of all property and the bottom 50% owning less than 4%.

Chamath argues that there are many similarities between the Gilded Age and today - both economic and societal.

But what came of the Gilded Age?

Well, the excesses and lopsided nature of the Gilded Age ushered in the Progressive Era, which was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States that spanned the 1890s to the 1920s.

As well as addressing the problems caused by industrialising, urbanisation, immigration and political corruption, the Progressive movement also sought regulation of monopolies (trust busting) and corporations through antitrust laws.

Of course, Chamath is not the only high profile investor to highlight the [importance of looking to the past for lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5LqCAtNJJ4).

Chamath highlights the rise of populism and the increasingly loud calls for change.

Therefore, in this context, the last few years seem very much akin to the beginning of the end of our modern Gilded Age and the beginning of a new Progressive Era.

**Part 2/5 - Tech Regulation:**

The question is: which companies will be broken up and when?

Drawing on the comparison with the Gilded Age, Chamath states that the only way to effectively reign in Big Tech is via trust busting.

He expects Big Tech to be broken up within the next 5-10 years, with Facebook being first on the list.

Chamath also highlights the importance of making sure that Big Tech doesn't find a way of helping write the regulations such that they can promote and cement their monopoly.

Moreover, Chamath describes the value created by Big Tech as an increasingly decaying function, while the need for true progress is increasing.

The combined R&amp;D budgets of Big Tech total more than $600BN in the last decade.

""Big Tech promised to change the world and eradicate its evils, but it's clear that it isn't happening as they seem more focused on protecting their monopolies than advancing humanity.""

For some context, the cost of the *entire* Apollo program was $25BN (or around $150BN in today's dollars). However, Big Tech spent $75BN on R&amp;D in *2018 alone*.

**Part 3/5 - The Market:**

Chamath then gives his take on the market, stating that central banks have exhausted their ability to meaningfully manage inflation, in either direction, but that doesn't mean that stock prices won't continue to go higher via unnecessarily cutting rates and flooding markets with money.

""Our simple framework is this: as money gets cheaper, the credit markets continue to expand because CEOs become motivated to artificially boost Earnings Per Share. They do this by buying back stock, seek bad acquisitions, make poor capital allocation decisions or avoid taxes. All enabled by borrowing massive amounts of essentially free money. It shouldn’t surprise you to know that these decisions also result in ever increasing CEO pay.""

Basically, Earnings Per Share is net profit/number of outstanding shares - so when companies buyback their own shares the number of outstanding shares decreases and therefore the denominator decreases and therefore Earnings Per Share increases.

Now because many CEOs have bonuses that are tied to hitting a certain Earnings Per Share, this leads to an obvious incentive for corporations to buyback their own stock.

It is little wonder that Corporations are the dominant source of equity demand.

In the words of Charlie Munger:

""Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.""

**Part 4/5 - VCs:**

""VCs are increasingly motivated by the incentives of up-rounds, bigger funds and fee-based compensation. The flood of fast money has created a surfeit {pronounced surf-it} of these overnight practitioners with questionable sources of capital and even more questionable backgrounds.""

""Big Tech raised a total of $1.345BN in venture capital before going public of which $1.3BN was Facebook alone. This means that Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google raised less than $45MM *combined* before IPO. Even on an inflation adjusted basis, this is incredible and tells something very important about a raft of today's startups.""

**Part 5/5 - Performance:**

It's safe to say 2019 was a pretty good year for Social Capital.

The returns in 2019 lifted their inception to date performance by more than 350bps.

Since inception in 2011, they have compounded their money 997%, beating the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends reinvested) by more than 3 times.

In 2019, they generated more than $1.7BN in cash and cash equivalents.

Chamath states that liquidity will be increasingly important over the next few years.

""Selling, when appropriate, and generating cash in a thoughtful way seems to be a prudent decision for the next several years.""

In 2019, they completed two transactions:

The first was an investment of more than $500MM into Virgin Galactic, thus creating the first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company.

Chamath is tight lipped about the second company, but describes it as ""an acquisition of a venture backed company that had raised almost $100MM of traditional VC money.""

In the Letter, Chamath compares the first 8 years of Social Capital to the first 8 years of Berkshire Hathaway.

However, [even Chamath agreed that the Berkshire Hathaway comparison was slightly misleading](https://twitter.com/bornaVC/status/1237181119277088768) \- as the ratio of Berkshire Hathaway performance to the S&amp;P 500 was around double the ratio of Social Capital to the S&amp;P 500 over their respective periods.

Nonetheless, still pretty good!

YAHOO

2) Everybody wants money, there is no easy way, no bitcoins, on stocks, no anything, think about this, who the hell is gonna offer you easy money if that person/company can have it for itself? Yeah, companies like Robinhood make it look easy, guess what? because no matter the result, they get commission for every stock you buy, they do not give a shit about you.

3) nobody know shit about the stock market.- The market is exactly like gambling on a horse race, some people(the great minority of course\[the house always win\]) will say something like ""oh I knew it was about to win because today is raining and the wind was blowing to the north and..."", that was only luck, and nothing else, even the great companies who show you statistics and stuff have no idea, not even the ""experts"" and professional analyst, think about this again, if I know how to make a lot of money and what is gonna happen, why should I share that knowledge with people I do not even know?

\- I have a company XXX and need some cash to expand my operations and work, so, I will offer part of my company(by selling stocks) and get the funds, in exchange, I will share profits(and lost) with the people who bought them; The company once it creates the IPO(initial public offer) have knowledge of how much will they get, after that, the rest is just people selling and selling and selling over and over again, this is why NOBODY knows and NOBODY can predict shit.

Alright, so I just went through some ANN codes I developed on Python and R; when I got my results for my stock market prediction, I do wonder if I can rely on these results to make decisions:

1. I just used the most fundamental feature which is ***% of*** ***ROI*** for each day from several years; but from my POV, even if I do put in more data (e.g. sentiment features, etc.), how could an ML model predict the stock market correctly when there are just ***so many things that can change*** in its environment?
2. Suppose, even if it has 70-80% accuracy and used K-fold testing or whatnot, this is based on ***the data it's trained on - isn't this an artificial and risky conclusion?***
3. And if we really want to believe the result, the investor ***really need to believe*** ***in the theory*** of ""efficient market hypothesis"" where it states past data can tell future data's performance? - as I progress through these ML methods, I am certainly more inclined that the market is based on the random walk theory, thus no correct pattern can be predicted in future? (because it (i.e. the ML results and the mechanism that gave the results) just doesn't make sense to me)

I understand that ANN (regardless of its variance), uses ""weights"" to detect pattern from the dataset (the dataset can be anything from pictures, financial data, etc.); thus this is how ANN learns i.e. it goes through some iterations to update the weights until the error reaches some acceptable value. Once we understand what weights randomisation, local minima, gradient descent, the need to have very large data for training, etc., the trader may see the limits of MLs such as ANN, and I think the model alone is not enough (and expensive) to make the call for buying/ selling stocks?

# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.
*****
&gt; It’s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald’s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia’s plan to reopen.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.
*****
&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.
*****
&gt; “If you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it’s a fundamental story,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “The fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.”
*****
&gt; Golub said it’s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that’s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. “People are watching what’s going on in places like Georgia, but they’re also watching what’s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,” he said. “At the end of the day, there’s really one thing that really matters. It’s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.”
*****
&gt; # Fed bazooka
&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it’s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.
*****
&gt; “I’m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “I think we’re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what’s working and the things that still need to happen.”
*****
&gt; Tilley said the Fed’s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. “It looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they’ve come back in,” he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank’s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.
*****
&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn’t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.
*****
&gt; “The Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they’re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,” he said. “Whether you’re borrowing from a bank or whether you’re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.”
*****
&gt; # Economic impact
&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.
*****
&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.
*****
&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday’s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.
*****
&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.
*****
&gt; “We’ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,” Tilley said.
*****
&gt; # Earnings
&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.
*****
&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.
*****
&gt; “The most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It’s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,” said Golub. “My estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it’s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that’s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.”
*****
&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. “We had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that’s really bad.” Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.

# Election-year Mays: DJIA’s Second Worst Month

&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.

&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

&gt; In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).

# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective

&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We’ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we’ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.

&gt; “We recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.

# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we’ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?

&gt; “This remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When we’ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.

# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020

&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy has performed so far this year.

&gt; The ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.

&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.

&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.

# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far

&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.

&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators

&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed’s National Activity index started off the week coming in at –4.19 which was well below estimates of –3. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**

&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell’s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.

# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)

&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.

&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).

# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To

&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.

&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.

Amazon.com Inc. is asking warehouse employees who have stayed away from work during the pandemic to return for scheduled shifts beginning May 1, or request a leave of absence.

Fossil fuels:

-First we must locate oil in the ground, this costs time, money, resources.

-Once oil is located, we must frack it out of the ground which costs time, money, resources. In addition it's awful for the environment, oil gets flushed into soil and water reservoirs, destroying wildlife. 

-Once oil is collected, it must be driven to a refiner, time, money resources.

-Refiner must refine the oil, time, money, resources. In addition it pollutes our air, destroying our lungs, causing cancer, asthmas, respiratory diseases and costing Americans millions every year in healthcare costs https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9501.html

-Once oil is refined. It must be piped around the country. Building these pipelines are insanely expensive to build and maintain. Hundreds of millions of pipeline infrastructure, and every few decades it needs to be rebuilt to prevent oil leaks. The sad part is a lot already does leak because of poor infrastructure but it's cheaper to let some oil leak rather than fixing all the necessary pipelines. Again a very resource intensive problem.

-Then everyday consumers must go to a gas station every so often to refuel their cars.

Let's compare to renewable energy generation 

Renewable energy (solar):

-Solar panels are constructed

-Solar panels are connected to a battery to have power when sun isn't out

-Solar panels and battery are connected to a grid

Also a fun thing I've noticed as a tesla owner, every night I plug my car in and wake up to a full charge like I do with my iPhone! Also I know this sub loves dividends, well I've actually made money selling unused energy to my power company :) much more satisfying and reliable than dividends!

Now which seems like a smarter way to go about powering our world? Also oil is a LIMITED resource. Also yes oil currently provides more energy than solar but we haven't been researching solar panels, as technology improves, solar will become more efficient and cheaper to produce the quicker we get behind it.

Those are my thoughts, please provide yours, but I don't think oil is a wise investment. Sure we won't stop using oil overnight but why invest in something the world NEEDS to move away from? Why not invest in the ""next oil"" companies?

[As per FT](https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100)

The divergence between the flying stock market and the dying economy is so extreme it is leaving many analysts scrambling for explanations.

The recent string of economic data releases reflecting life under global coronavirus lockdowns has been even grimmer than expected, spurring the IMF this week to forecast the biggest global recession since the 1930s’ Great Depression.

Some investors are in awe at the scale of the shock. “We really are in uncharted territory,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “We have a monster mash-up of the Great Depression in size, the crash of 1987 in speed, and 9-11 attack in terms of fear.”

And yet, stock markets have been on a tear for a month. What was once dismissed as a mere “bear market rally” — often strong but ultimately doomed bounces that can occur in the middle of severe downturns — has now turned into a 23 per cent jump for global stocks. Technically, that qualifies as a new bull market. 

The rise has erased half the stock market’s fall since late February, and brought the FTSE All-World index back to levels seen in the US tax cut-fuelled summer rally of 2017. Analysts and investors say that global efforts by central banks to soothe the financial system have been the trigger.

Citigroup estimates that the biggest central banks will buy $5tn of bonds this year, led by the US Federal Reserve, which is more than twice the size of the stimulus seen at the peak of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The Fed has even charged into areas once thought untouchable for central banks, announcing plans to support corporate debt graded “junk” by credit rating agencies.

Throw in various other liquidity injections and a series of government spending packages aimed at ameliorating the effects of measures taken to contain the coronavirus outbreak, and the overall stimulus bill comes to $14tn, according to the IMF. 

“The Fed has been very clear that it will do whatever it takes,” said Joyce Chang, chair of global research at JPMorgan. “The question is whether this will be enough.”

Many investors seem to think so. Technology stocks are once again leading the rally, but even travel and leisure stocks have jumped 24 per cent from the lows, trimming their decline this year to 37 per cent. Investors appear to be writing off 2020, focusing instead on the prospects for an economic normalisation in 2021, analysts say. 

Some of the technical forces that fuelled the sell-off are also helping stoke the comeback. Hedging by banks, trading strategies that automatically buy when volatility simmers down, and thinner liquidity are all now supporting the rally, according to JPMorgan. 

History also offers some encouragement to the optimists. Bespoke Investment Group crunched the numbers on every big US stock market slump, and found that once equities had clawed back over half their losses, that had tended to signal that the lows would not be retested. 

One notable exception, however, was after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. The US stock market rallied over 44 per cent from the November 1929 low through to March 1930 before sliding another 80 per cent, and did not reclaim its 1929 highs until September 1954.

Some investors think this is a plausible scenario now. Paul Singer, the head of Elliott Management, warned that stocks could easily renew their slide and drop by half from the February peak.

“Despite the massive stimulus moves around the world and the unimaginably large new rounds of money printing, there is substantial uncertainty about the future viability of a large range of businesses,” Mr Singer wrote, in a recent letter to clients. “To us there does not appear to be a gilded cornucopia of shining bargains.”

Some nervousness began to creep back into markets this week, triggered by ructions in the oil market crowned by the unprecedented sight of the benchmark US crude price sliding below zero on Monday. Although partly a technical dislocation, it underscored the fragile state of the global economy. 

Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season has started to reveal the extent of the revenue destruction hitting many companies. And such grim results may pale next to what is likely to be a “horrific” second quarter, warns Karen Ward, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

The message was hammered home by data released on Thursday showing another 4.4m Americans claiming unemployment benefits, taking the total since mid-March to over 26m. A potential antiviral drug for coronavirus failed its first randomised clinical trial, further denting sentiment.

Ms Sonders points out that even if equities do not plunge below the lows of March, economic downturns of this magnitude tend to produce a lot of head-fake rallies and stomach-churning sell-offs. 

“Anyone who thinks we’re going to keep moving up in a straight line is living in la-la land,” she warned. ",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,392634,public,confidence,self,Investors baffled by soaring stocks in ‘monster’ depression,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g7hjza/investors_baffled_by_soaring_stocks_in_monster/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tesla Inc. is adding a 10th director to its board and emphasizing several of his Elon Musk-friendly qualities.

Hiromichi Mizuno, whose term as chief investment officer of Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund ended last month, becomes Tesla’s newest independent director and will sit on the board’s audit committee. The electric-car maker said Mizuno’s career has included work in Silicon Valley and on environmentalism and sustainability. Tesla also noted that he’s challenged the practice of short selling, which Musk has derided for years.

&amp;#x200B;

Mizuno became the first investment head of Japan’s $1.5 trillion pension fund in 2015 and oversaw sweeping changes that shifted its portfolio to stocks from domestic debt. Under his guidance, the GPIF’s investments in green, social and sustainability bonds exceeded $3 billion last year.

Mizuno made international headlines by blasting short-sellers for “short-termism” in an interview with the Financial Times last year. In December, the fund announced it would stop lending overseas stocks as it was concerned the practise was inconsistent with its stewardship code.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,392628,public,confidence,self,Tesla Adds Former CIO of World’s Largest Pension Fund to Board,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g7hfds/tesla_adds_former_cio_of_worlds_largest_pension/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 However, one cannot deny the fact that electric powertrains are witnessing rapid development while ICE engines are inching towards their limit of advancement. Today, there are many EV brands with products that are arguably better or at least on par with their ICE counterparts. 

Notable examples include Rimac Automobili, Rivian, etc., but in the minds of the wider mass, Tesla would always be at the forefront. Tesla, Inc., really set the benchmark for modern-day electric vehicles. 

The team under Elon Musk proved that electric cars are not supposed to be weird, quirky and undesirable but technologically loaded, good-looking (thanks to Franz von Holzhausen; except for the Cybertruck) and better than an ICE alternative coming in the same price range — if not for anything else, this stands true for the Tesla Model 3 Performance.  


It is a bit difficult to list out all the advantages of a premium electric vehicle over a similarly-priced petrol or diesel model. However, the ability to receive new features and improved performance via an Over-The-Air or OTA update (like on a smartphone) is something which was an out-of-the-world thought during the time of ‘regular cars’. Now, a new update is on the way for the Model S and Model X ‘Performance’ models featuring the brand’s new Raven powertrain. 

&amp;#x200B;

As per a tweet shared by Tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee, the Tesla Model S Performance sedan’s 0-100km/h acceleration time comes down to 2.3 seconds while the figure stands at 2.6 seconds for the Model X Performance crossover. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, quarter-mile times drop down to 10.4 seconds and 11 seconds, respectively. In addition to this, the cars receive more endurance for back-to-back launch controls. Tesla has already introduced a new ‘Cheetah Stance’ launch mode. This is a free update and various reports state that the cars get almost 50bhp. Do take a moment to imagine your car, parked in the garage, getting a significant bump in output by connecting to your WiFi. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, automobiles have come a long way! While we cannot blindly believe the statement that ‘electric cars can save the planet’, it is fair to say that emission-free modes of transport would be an important step in conserving the environment. However, there should be a balance between electric and ‘electrified’ or cleaner ICE engines to actually help Mother Earth. The reason is that in many developing nations, electricity is still generated using fuming coal power plants.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,392627,public,confidence,self,Tesla’s new OTA update makes Model S and Model X Performance faster,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g7hegq/teslas_new_ota_update_makes_model_s_and_model_x/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's talk about the popular Amazon.com, Inc. ([NASDAQ: ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-amzn/amazoncom?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=1180933)AMZN). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Amazon.com’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

### Is Amazon.com still cheap?

According to my valuation model, Amazon.com seems to be fairly priced at around 8.67% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Amazon.com today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $2185.54, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grows beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Amazon.com’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator of share price volatility

&amp;#x200B;

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Amazon.com. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

### What this means for you:

**Are you a shareholder?** It seems like the market has already priced in AMZN’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

**Are you a potential investor?** If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMZN, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

## What do These Ratings Mean?

Finding the best stocks can be tricky. It isn’t easy to compare companies across industries. Even companies that have relatively similar businesses can be tricky to compare sometimes. *InvestorsObserver*’s tools allow a top-down approach that lets you pick a metric, find the top sector and industry and then find the top stocks in that sector.

These scores are not only easy to understand, but it is easy to compare stocks to each other. You can find the best stock in an industry, or look for the sector that has the highest average score. The overall score is a combination of technical and fundamental factors that serves as a good starting point when analyzing a stock. Traders and investors with different goals may have different goals and will want to consider other factors than just the headline number before making any investment decisions.

I've been wondering about a 1-1.5% expense ratio for a 401k contirbuting pretax vs 0.03% VOO vanguard index fund post tax. I'm trying to find a break even point at which is no longer makes sense to contribute to 401K but makes more sense to contribute to taxable account. I keep seeing article about massive losses with fees over time and trying to compare apples to apples. Example as one article  [https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/millennial-retirement-fees-one-percent-half-million-savings-impact/](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/millennial-retirement-fees-one-percent-half-million-savings-impact/) 

In this day and age of such low expense ratios are 401k plans scam at 1-1.5% expense ratio. I started a google sheet to compare over 40 years and seems 401k is still worth it to defer taxes and use compounding over time. trying to figure this out before retirement since i'm still less than 30 and don't want to be duped over time with high fees.

However, on this app I have to choose ""volume"", but I don't get what this means and how I can see how much money I'm actually investing. 

I get volume means how much of something I'm buying, but how does that translate to money, and how can I check that on the app?

I have Robin Hood btw cause I heard that was most beginner friendly. 

But my questions include
What stocks would be best for something short term like day trading or week trading. I have been looking at some stocks like Disney and it seems like you can litterally only make 1 or 2 dollars off a stock cause it peaks and drops around the same spots. Is that 1 or 2 dollars worth it?

I want to get involved with like long term holding so who might be the best for that right now? Should I just wait and try to hop on the next company that has potential to take the world over like Amazon did?

Also Robinhood game me a free stock for wpx energy which sells for 4$ while some people get free apple stocks that sell for around 200$ •_•

In Summery I want to make money from the stock market but I am still somewhat unclear on how.

I put it on short. This week on Tuesday I sold for £8k profit, having put in £4k. Here is my tip this week. 

\*At your own risk\*

WTI has slowly risen for the past couple of days to the 17-18 mark for June. Now most ETF's track July and August but June is pretty important for two reasons. The crash in oil prices to below 0 was due to the contracts not been able to be sold like they normally are on Monday and Tuesday. This caused prices to turn negative as they could not be delievered. 

May contract is over but another beast awaits the horizon. The brent June contract which expires on the 30th. Now because brent is slightly different it is unlikely to hit negative. However, as the time looms due to no demand for june expect a massive drop to prices. I am predicting at least 10. Maybe 5. 

This would drive the price of WTI for june july and august down too. As they are correlated. 

As this is happening on the 30th expect a slow decline Today or tomorrow. Latest Monday morning. 

Although it has hit 17-18, it seems to have hit a ceiling. My advice is to put it into an ETF like SCO as it has a big asset base and less likely to collapse like we saw this week, Stay away from small asset ETFS. 

That is what I did.

I've noticed all banks I look up have short term assets only being a tiny fraction of their short term liabilities. 

I know banks can loan out something like 38 times every dollar they have sitting in the bank.
 Is there some special rule that allows them to have such low short term assets compared to their short term liabilities or do they typically rely on government bonds or the like?


I still have more to investigate, but
I'm also wondering if they have factored in the additional bad debts from the current economic downturn or lack of income since some of them are allowing deferred loans and making it considerably harder to get a credit card.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,392080,public,confidence,self,Do banks have special rules regarding their short term assets and Short term liabilities?,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g75bou/do_banks_have_special_rules_regarding_their_short/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And ruined my life and my family savings! Not sure what do now? And if there is a lawyer can help me about closing my positions! I have a proof of everything!

Also, I wanted to note that I didn’t mean to use the margin, TD Ameritrade doesn’t show how much I am using from the margin until the stocks goes down and the margin calls shows up, I feel that they do that trap in purpose so they can take new investors money! I know I was greedy and I didn’t know how Oil ETFs works but they also trapping new users they should show how much I used from the margin

CYLC has a tiny float of less than 1.5M shares which makes the stock more susceptible to volatility if demand hits.

Shares were also trading roughly 5x higher than current levels earlier this year!

CYLC is looking like a ground-floor situation that could zoom higher as more Americans consider growing plants and cannabis at home.

The coronavirus has changed life for many and being able to grow plants at home without having to go to the dispensaries could be a relief to millions of people.

And if marijuana becomes legalized on a federal level, the market will just grow even larger for the company's growing systems.

A countertop version of the company's game changing growing system could be huge!

Wall Street may be about to get a major wake up call to this thriving and exciting Cannabis company that is trading at just pennies!


CYLC has a history of quick jumps that can produce tremendous returns in the short-term.

This may be attributed to the fact that CYLC has a tiny float of under 1.5M shares according to OTCMarkets.

Low float stocks are considered very volatile vehicles and if Wall Street discovers how tiny CYLC’s float is, it could potentially lead to readers netting some monstrous profits.

The stock has doubled or tripled in just days many times over.

Recently on 3/23, shares moved from $0.06 to $0.1298 on 3/24 for a gain of over 100%!

Shares then sailed even higher to hit $0.18 on 4/1 representing a gain of 200% in less than two weeks!

CYLC was over 30 cents in January and over 45 cents this past October. There could be an epic bounce poised to happen if traders learn more about the company's growing systems.

I felt like an absolute idiot. I chalked it up as a reminder of Trading 101- only do market buys in an emergency (so, never). 

Well, I didn’t heed my own advice about not doing market transactions and that evening decided I would clearly never make this money back up. 

This time I entered a market sell of 0.801802 shares to execute on 4/21 at market open. Well, it executed alright. It executed at $2,157.62/share for a total sale of $1,729.98.

I looked both transactions over and over and over. The daily highs clearly don’t reflect either of those prices.

My question— did a huge buy volume at open trigger these price spikes? Was it a glitch? Does this mean someone sold it to me at the $194 price and then someone bought it from me for $2,157?

Is it honestly even possible that a price fluctuated that much?

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

To be  clear, this is how I see the long term picture - a couple of years - which is where I'm focused (not about immediate stock price).  

The shutdown will ultimately make Tesla more valuable given the combination of (1) the effect of the crisis on legacy auto's EV investments which will give Tesla several more years of having the EV space largely to itself, (2) the likely subsidies on the other side of the crises (e.g. cash for clunkers), and (3) massive government incentive programs and their effect on scaling Tesla's energy and solar businesses. Tesla will survive the near term difficulties and emerge a much more valuable company with subsidies and grants helping accelerate it.

I laid out the thesis more specifically in this video if you are interested:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWl6nmQIC2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWl6nmQIC2w)

**Hello everyone,**  


***This script contains:***

* ***TradingViews SuperTrend***\*, (used this because it is the most commonly used trailing indicator)\*
* *Market Snipers unreleased version*
* *3 reversal Momentum fields (so you can play with every timeframe)*
* *Direct signal Take Profit*
* *Direct signal Rebuy/Increase*
* *Take-Profit*

*The Algo works best on Heinkin-Ashi (extensively tested it without a single reprint on my algo, it smooths out the oscilators I use for it and increases the success rate). I use SuperTrend as the basis, there shouldn't be any reprints.

After the amazing feedback on Market Sniper (THANK YOU!) **V. alpha**, I am more than motivated to finish my final release! It will be invite-only.  


But I did get one type of criticism: ""It'S tOo CoMpLiCaTeD To UsE. tHiS dOeSn'T hElP mE""  
Well, I am thankful for those inputs, but my opinion is that some people were searching for a magic pill. So I created one, overnight!  
And guess what? This script is as simple as it gets: I took the algorithm I am working on and simply used additions and subtractions of the algos signals,(Yes, I took the reversals signals and +bullish-bearish over Fibonacci periods. NOT HARD! and yes, I wanted to prove a point XD )  


What's best, I don't need to guarantee you it doesn't reprint, that is profitable and demand 30-300$ a month for a heinkin-ashi BS script that actually doesn't work, like most people here, (Many people used it, giving a lot of feedback in discord, reddit and TV. not a single reprint*). I am giving you a chance to see that for yourself over the next month!*  


*Now, this script will be temporarily up and I will afterwards release my Invite-Only strategy that I have prepared with 80%+ profitable trades, 1%+ profit per trade, &lt;0.35% drawback on every single asset I tested (still need to test FOREX extensively).*  


*Now, with that out of the way, let's get into the technicals:*  


***This is a script contains:***  


* ***TradingViews SuperTrend****, (used this because it is the most commonly used trailing indicator)*  

* *Market Snipers unreleased version*  

* *3 reversal Momentum fields (so you can play with every timeframe)*  

* *Direct signal Take Profit*  

* *Direct signal Rebuy/Increase*  

* *Take-Profit*  

* *Stop-Loss*  


*First, I need to point out I spent 3H fine-tuning this script for* ***15min binance -*** [***BTC*** ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)***Perpetual Contracts****(it simply gives of the most frequent and best signals on my algo out of all exchanges).

Germany has been reporting 3.75 in 1000 with 15% antibody positive rate for a while... flu typically kills 1 in 1000 (max recorded for flu mortality is 1.4 in 1000 in 2017 )**\n\nNYC results are in line with what Germany has been reporting. Considering obesity epidemic and higher percent of African Americans (who are infected at a higher rate), NYC numbers are in line with the German reports of 3.75 in 1000. Higher rates reported before by various countries were because we didn't have the correct denominator (number of people infected).\n\nSome people would like to use 'years lost' instead of mortality rate. This would make Covid more similar to Flu, because Covid disproportionately affects seniors. This however is not the models governments use to make assessments. Few years ago this caused too much controversy and hence do not use 'years lost' models as economic decisions are not based on those models; ie no senior discount.\n\nCurrently 14% of New Yorkers showed antibody. As the number of people with antibody increases R0 decreases. California reports that when they retrospectively examined some death that occured in Dec-Jan and now we know that Covid was spreading in California in Dec 2019.\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-coronavirus-13-9-percent-coronavirus-antibodies-covid-19/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-coronavirus-13-9-percent-coronavirus-antibodies-covid-19/)\n\nAlso just for the record about the German study of Gangelt showing 15% infection rate with 3.75 in 1000 mortality rate: [https://reason.com/2020/04/09/preliminary-german-study-shows-a-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-of-about-0-4-percent/](https://reason.com/2020/04/09/preliminary-german-study-shows-a-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-of-about-0-4-percent/)\n\nThe fact that the numbers in NY and Germany are are identical is very reassuring.\n\nI am not saying this is bullish or bearish. What you do with this information is your call. This does not address the fact that consumers and directors are spooked by what we went through specially in bigger cities which resembled zombie apocalypse.

Germany has been reporting 3.75 in 1000 with 15% antibody positive rate for a while... flu typically kills 1 in 1000 (max recorded for flu mortality is 1.4 in 1000 in 2017 )&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NYC results are in line with what Germany has been reporting. Considering obesity epidemic and higher percent of African Americans (who are infected at a higher rate), NYC numbers are in line with the German reports of 3.75 in 1000. Higher rates reported before by various countries were because we didn&amp;#39;t have the correct denominator (number of people infected).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people would like to use &amp;#39;years lost&amp;#39; instead of mortality rate. This would make Covid more similar to Flu, because Covid disproportionately affects seniors. This however is not the models governments use to make assessments. Few years ago this caused too much controversy and hence do not use &amp;#39;years lost&amp;#39; models as economic decisions are not based on those models; ie no senior discount.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently 14% of New Yorkers showed antibody. As the number of people with antibody increases R0 decreases. California reports that when they retrospectively examined some death that occured in Dec-Jan and now we know that Covid was spreading in California in Dec 2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-coronavirus-13-9-percent-coronavirus-antibodies-covid-19/""&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-coronavirus-13-9-percent-coronavirus-antibodies-covid-19/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also just for the record about the German study of Gangelt showing 15% infection rate with 3.75 in 1000 mortality rate: &lt;a href=""https://reason.com/2020/04/09/preliminary-german-study-shows-a-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-of-about-0-4-percent/""&gt;https://reason.com/2020/04/09/preliminary-german-study-shows-a-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-of-about-0-4-percent/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that the numbers in NY and Germany are are identical is very reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not saying this is bullish or bearish. What you do with this information is your call. This does not address the fact that consumers and directors are spooked by what we went through specially in bigger cities which resembled zombie apocalypse.

The unemployment continues to climb sky high and the markets move up. Can someone tell me what’s going on here? Will they just spend the US Dollar’s value into the floor with equity purchases? How much longer do you think this joy ride goes before the US economy has to “pay the piper”-if at all?

I went against the Fed and I got bit pretty badly a few weeks ago (SPXU). I’ve learned my lesson and moved back into the market. For the past couple weeks, I’ve been backing positions into companies that either did really well during the 2009 economic recovery, have good dividends, or seem like the value is too good to be true, but I can’t tell if this is a time bomb I’m strapped to now.

In the government database, a contract officer wrote that the procurement was “ordered by the White House.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.propublica.org/article/the-white-house-pushed-fema-to-give-its-biggest-coronavirus-contract-to-a-company-that-never-had-to-bid/amp""&gt;Here is the article &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dug further and found this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gordon Flatt has a 19.8% share of AirBoss of America. Flatt’s the brother of Bruce Flatt, the CEO of Brookfield Asset Management, which saved Jared Kushner from defaulting on 666 5th Avenue. Is Kushner repaying a favor through his “task force”?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://m.marketscreener.com/AIRBOSS-OF-AMERICA-CORP-1409237/company/""&gt;60% of shares are held by a handful of shareholders &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying all of this, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if Jared kushner (Trump&amp;#39;s son in law) awards further protective equipment contracts to Airboss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'stocks', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qjfk', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/stocks', 'subreddit_subscribers': 613201, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Interesting info I found on Airboss of America Corp', 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 3, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g6hnl1/interesting_info_i_found_on_airboss_of_america/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",,,,,,,,,,

(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. is selling new junk bonds, even as the company sits on a record high cash balance and turned its first quarter of positive cash flow in six years.

The streaming giant is looking to borrow $1 billion between dollars and euros to fund content acquisitions and production, among other general corporate purposes, according to a statement Wednesday. The five-year dollar securities may yield around 3.75%, not far off that of a low investment-grade rated company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

like many other retail investors I was warned about the rollover losses that will come due to the contango situation that would make ETFs/ETCs unattractive. I try to understand what rollover losses in futures contracts are, but I cannot wrap my head around it.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I know, you get rollover losses in a situation like in the current crude futures where the near ending futures are much cheaper than the far in the future ones. So when the April contract ends, you have to move to the May contract. You get ""losses"" because the May contract is more expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

An example for illustration:

April contract costs $10 per share. May costs $15. You (or the ETF) is invested with $1200.

At the end of April contract you close my position and sell your 120 shares. Now the May contracts are being bought, each for $15. So you get 1200/15 = 80 shares. 

According to what I read, this is an rollover loss. But I don't understand where the loss is. The position is still  80\*$15 = $1200. 

So where is my loss? What am I missing here.

Not profitable yet but I really like their product, management and can see this taking off. They announced they are doing well during Corona.


Capcom

They started to revive old franchises and did a decent job over the past years. They have a high-end, VR capable engine they developed in-house. They announced the engine is also suitable for next gen consoles.

The Eurozone’s preliminary PMIs for April will be released tomorrow, and the numbers could be abysmal. The preliminary PMIs for April will reveal just how much economic damage the pandemic has inflicted, with forecasts pointing to another drop deeper into contraction territory for both the manufacturing and services indexes.

Admittedly though, economic data don’t mean much right now. While investors could pay some attention to the PMIs since they also contain a forward-looking component, most of the price action in the euro might be driven by the meeting of EU leaders.

They will be discussing more stimulus measures, including the prospect of some risk-sharing mechanism like Eurobonds. If agreed, this could be a game-changer for the euro. It would imply a quicker recovery in the most virus-ravaged economies such as Italy and Spain, and remove some of the political risk premia.

However, despite some recent signs of flexibility, such an agreement remains very unlikely given the scale of opposition from Germany and the Netherlands. Therefore, the risks surrounding the euro’s reaction seem asymmetric. With nobody really expecting a deal, a surprise Eurobond agreement would likely push the euro much higher, whereas another disappointment might only generate minor losses.

They must have had way more activity on their website than usual. It seems like all people do these days is read the news.

Earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL) will take center stage Wednesday.

The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel demand got hammered over recent months and major U.S. airlines have had to slash capacity in an attempt to preserve cash. Investors will be focusing on commentary from Delta’s management Wednesday morning for any updates on how the company is dealing with the ongoing pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Delta is expected to report and adjusted LOSS per share of 87 cents on $9.19 billion in revenue during Q1. On April 4, Delta said that it was burning through $60 million of cash per day and expected second-quarter revenue to fall 90%.

Netflix this afternoon said it added a stunning 15.77 million net new paid subscribers in the first quarter, more than twice the company’s pre-coronavirus forecast for 7 million net adds. That number crushed even the most optimistic estimates on the Street. 


NFLX revenues for the quarter were $5.77 billion, in line with the Wall Street analyst consensus at $5.76 billion, while profits were $1.57 a share, a little below the Street at $1.65.

It is still very much a trading/investing group, but we understand that there are valid cases for discussing politics, trade wars, and other topics that can impact the markets.

Hope to see you guys all in the chat soon! :)

This stock has been pretty volatile in that five year span and I can’t help but think it will go up to maybe 90 later this year or if not by then, maybe sometime during 2021 - plus it has potential to reach previous highs of 140ish. For it to go back to 140 in perhaps 2 years from now, it would have to rise about 100 % from this date. In comparison, that would put the Dow at 47.300 which seems completely impossible, right? 

Now, I would have to sell some ETFs (DOW/S&amp;P 500 ish) to be able to buy some RL so my question is - and thank you if you want to help me out with this! - is it likely that Ralph Lauren will recover some or potentially a lot over the next two years? Or do you think there is a high probability that it will maintain its current price or even go lower or simply just full behind the Dow over the next two years?

Caution returned to world markets as a drubbing for U.S. WTI crude oil kicked off a busy week of data and earnings that will drive home the damage being inflicted by global Covid-19 lockdowns. Investors will be watching for signs of progress as heads of European Union governments are scheduled to hold a video summit over how to tackle the economic fallout from the crisis on Thursday, where differing views on coronabonds, mostly demanded by the southern EU member states, are expected to be voiced.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:**

The world woke up to the rude fact that the price for oil is not actually bound by zero. Though many will dismiss the panic selling in the May futures of WTI crude oil and say it is primarily due to the maturity contract today, the demand destruction is what has led to persistently weak prices despite the OPEC+ deal with US support. Market disruptions like these will inevitably lead to stories of massive losses in various firms having exposure to the product thinking that 0 is the lowest it can go. Credit losses at banks due to loans made to various firms that have oil trading activities will soon be revealed.

I wondered if there was any way to gamble my money in oil futures with 5000$, and try to buy futures with a far away expiry date (3-5+ years) ? Is it possible ? What would be the fees involved ?

I'm clueless about which product to buy. CFDs are a big no-no, they charge 100%+ in financing fees right now, and oil companies stocks are more risky (or ask more fundamental analysis i guess ?) with less potential reward.

OIL GOES NEGATIVE!
 
Stocks Pullback
 
 
It’s impossible to start this with anything other than the fact that Oil futures for May, expiring tomorrow afternoon actually went into “negative” territory this afternoon, casting a pall over stocks that were recovering after a down opening and a low of -617 in the first 15 minutes.  As the market recovered the oil started to sink and by midafternoon, we had cracked the $10.00 level and things picked up speed.  By the end of the open-outcry session the oil had fallen to close at a remarkable -37.63/barrel.  That’s being paid $37,630 to take away 1000 barrels of oil.  The market faltered and fell to a new low for the day and finished -592.05 (2.44%), NASDAQ -89.41 (1.03%), S&amp;P 500 -51.40 (1.79%)the Russell -15.76 (1.28% and the DJ Transports was the big loser -264.08 (3.21%).  The DJIA was 26 down, 4 up with the biggest losers BA -69 and UNH -58DP’s.  Internals were weak at 3:1 Dow and 1.6:1 NASDAQ.  Only healthcare and communication services showed strength and Energy, real estate and utilities were the weakest.
 
 
Our “open forum” on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It’s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we’ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled “How to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,” over the long weekend.  I think it’s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is

SECTORS: Airlines were lower for a multitude of reasons, with LUV being downgraded, UAL cutting schedules by 90%, and doing a sale and leaseback on 32 planes to raise more cash.  Currently 2/3 of all planes are parked, worldwide.  BA had China cancel 29 737MAX’s and there was another cancellation by GE’s leasing services of 69 more planes.  Citi had already downgraded BA and the final was 143.61 -10.39 (6.75%).  DIS was also a downgrade and finished 102.26 -4.37 (4.1%).  After the close IBM reported and managed a surprise gain on earnings, but as usual missed on revenues and after closing 120.41 +.29, fell as low as $115 and finished $116.59 -3.82.
 
 
BIOPHARMA: was MIXED with BIIB -3.14, ABBV +1.03, REGN -.80, ISRG -8.00, GILD -2.29, MYL -.11, TEVA +.21, VRTX +4.54, BHC -.01, INCY +1.00, ICPT +1.34, LABU +4.03 (11.39%) and IBB $126.58 +1.94 (1.56%).
 
CANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.29, CGC +.35, CRON +.11, GWPH +3.75, ACB +.03, PYX -.21, NBEV +.02, CURLF +.06, KERN -.51 (6.49%) and MJ $11.55 +.03 (.26%).

 
DEFENSE: was LOWER with LMT -15.51, RTX -.51, GD -2.19, TXT -1.07, NOC -14.30 (4.01%), BWXT -.54, TDY -.39, and ITA $152.68 -4.89 (3.1%).
 
  
RETAIL: was LOWER with lots of talk about who would and wouldn’t need to file bankruptcy and M -.52, JWN-1.10, KSS -1.28, DDS -1.74, JCP -.02, WMT -1.72, TGT -3.92, TJX -1.33, RL -2.33, UAA-.15, LULU -6.42, TPR-1.02, CPRI +.36 and XRT $33.98 -.39 (1.13%).
 
 
FAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -13.00, AMZN +32.90, AAPL -5.70, FB -.27, NFLX +18.54, NVDA -4.22, TSLA -5.89, BABA +4.60, BIDU +.26, BA -10.01, CAT -1.66, DIS -3.68 and XLK $87.83 -1.43 (1.6%).
 
  
FINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -1.49, JPM -3.08, BAC -.71, MS -.55, C -1.36, PNC +1.29, AIG -.70, TRV -1.97, AXP -3.09, V -4.55 and XLF $22.00 -.39 (1.74%).
 
 
OIL, $20.43 -4.60. Oil was the BIGGEST STORY of the day (see above) but the new contract for June will now be the forward month.  Stocks were not down anywhere near the move in the May Oil, but most were slightly lower.  XLE finished $33.21 -.74 (2.18%).
 
  
METALS, GOLD: $1,711.20 + 12.40.  After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. Last night it fell into my buying range of 1680 -1690, hitting $1685.00 before rallying back to over $1700 before our markets were open.  I wouldn’t chase it today, but it is a little lower (-4.50) tonight so maybe a buy tomorrow.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $6795 -285. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we’d have to test 6750 and today we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Last night we tried the upside again trading 7,250 before moving with the market and the other futures to finish in the same area of support as other recent bottoms.  While I want to add the 350 I still want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.30 -.19 today.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Stock fell, tracking declines in oil prices as concerns over weak energy demand in an oversupplied market built up even further.

The declines extend a months-long drop for the commodity prices, which have been anchored both by fears of a supply glut and demand destruction due to the coronavirus pandemic.

On Monday, coronavirus cases topped 2.4 million globally, and the death toll rose above 166,000, according to Johns Hopkins data. U.S. confirmed cases totaled more than 761,000.

In New York state, the U.S. epicenter for the outbreak, Governor Andrew Cuomo said during a Sunday briefing that data showed the region was “past the high point” of the pandemic. The death toll rose by 507 as of Saturday, or well below the levels of over 700 daily new deaths reported about a week ago.

&gt;By Karen Langley  
&gt;  
&gt;Short sellers have revived their wagers against the stock market in recent weeks, taking their most aggressive positions in years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bets against the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund tracking the broad index, rose to $68.1 billion last week, the highest level in data going back to January 2016, according to financial analytics company S3 Partners. That was up from $41.7 billion at the beginning of 2020 and $41.2 billion a year ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, hoping to repurchase them at lower prices and keep the difference as profit. Among the individual companies they have targeted in recent weeks are travel-related firms, including Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Marriott International Inc. and Wynn Resorts Ltd.  
&gt;  
&gt;Those bets come during a wild year for investors who are struggling to reconcile the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the population and economy. The S&amp;P 500 suffered its fastest drop from a record to a bear market in history -- ultimately falling 34% between Feb. 19 and March 23. Its 28% rebound since then has also been brisk, leaving some investors anxious about the strength of the rally when so much remains unknown.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We've really seen a significant bounceback in the last three weeks at levels that I think are too quick,"" said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer at First American Trust. His firm recently bet against the Nasdaq-100, on the belief that technology stocks have fallen too little to reflect the probability of a recession. The index is up 1.1% in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;""When we see a strong move in one direction, where we think the fundamentals and the news can turn ugly, especially during an earnings cycle, we think that's an opportunity where we could see a 5,10% selloff again,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors are bracing for the possibility of more volatility this week, as earnings reports from companies including Coca-Cola Co., Netflix Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. give another glimpse at how the coronavirus is reshaping the landscape for U.S. business.  
&gt;  
&gt;The outsize market swings of late require vigilance from investors who sell shares short because they can face losses when prices rise. Short sellers incurred total mark-to-market losses of $108.8 billion over three days in late March when the S&amp;P 500 surged 18%, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.  
&gt;  
&gt;But with the potential for additional declines ahead, many investors have decided that the ability to hedge their portfolios -- or simply bet on a selloff -- is wise.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Things will go back to normal eventually and these positions will decrease but not until we start seeing less volatility in the market,"" Mr. Dusaniwsky said of the rise in short positions against the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust. ""No one's going to give up their insurance until they see the chances of catastrophe are in the rearview mirror.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The portion of available shares sold short against the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust has also risen, climbing to 27% in early April, the highest level since November 2016 and up from 14% at the beginning of 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The increase in bets against the market coincides with a push in other countries to temporarily curb short selling. At times of heightened volatility, critics often argue that the practice exacerbates downward pressure on stock prices. But Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has argued short selling is needed to facilitate ordinary market trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;To be sure, coronavirus has upended entire industries in recent weeks, leaving investors scrambling to reassess the growth prospects of companies from Marriott to Clorox Co. to Amazon.com Inc. to Carnival.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the pandemic devastating global travel, hotel, casino and cruise stocks have been among the hardest hit -- and seen some of the biggest additions to the short positions against them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many hotels and casinos temporarily closed their doors when demand evaporated, furloughing employees and curbing spending plans, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has extended a no-sail order for cruises into July.  
&gt;  
&gt;Short sellers have added a collective $797 million to their short positions against Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Marriott and Wynn over the past 30 days, according to data Friday from S3 Partners.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alex Lee, a San Francisco resident who manages a family sandwich shop in Oakland, Calif., and his wife had previously dabbled in short selling but have recently devoted more attention there. They made bets against Marriott, along with other stocks.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Because of Marriott's price at the time, it seemed like it had more room to fall and because of its heavy presence in Europe and the United States, we just thought that that company itself would be more vulnerable to falling more,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over two rounds of shorting Marriott stock in March and April, they made a profit of about $15,000, Mr. Lee said. Marriott recently said about 25% of its hotels are temporarily closed and North American occupancy levels are around 10%. Its shares are down 44% this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Among the stocks that saw big drops in short positioning in March were stodgy consumer-staples shares, which got a bounce as Americans stocked their pantries to wait out the pandemic at home.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We had a lifetime of trading in the month of March,"" said Mitch Rubin, chief investment officer at RiverPark Funds. He said he had previously bet against shares of Kroger Co., Walmart Inc., Clorox and Campbell Soup Co. but covered those positions in late February and early March as it became clear those companies would perform well with consumers sheltering in place.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Their business is healthier than it was before the crisis because the demand for their products has increased,"" he said. ""The amount of times you clean high-touch surfaces with a chemical disinfectant is going to go up for some period of time, maybe for the rest of our lives.""",False,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,388128,public,confidence,self,Bets Against the Stock Market Rise to Highest Level in Years,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g4xrbm/bets_against_the_stock_market_rise_to_highest/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've tried the following:

1. I tried to execute a buy order with attached an FX order. I thought that this way the required amount of PLN would be directly exchanged from my base currency without the need this to be done beforehand. It didn't work. I suppose this is allowed only for marginal accounts?
2. Then I wanted to exchange a small amount of EUR to buy 10 shares. I saw that I would be taxed a commission of \~3.60-4.50 EUR for the exchange. Is this normal and is it possible to lower the commission? Does it depend on the amount of money exchanged?

**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion is US history.

However, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.""

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. 

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. 

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN, ""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. 

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 50 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 50 times, it would reach the Sun!

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

1. Divide and Conquer and
2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)

As we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...

Speaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information. 

Information feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.

A fantastic example of this process is what has happened in the last week with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

The real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**

The depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future, now this will not necessarily happen straight away.

However, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism in inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.

From a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.

Essentially, this means that the value of the network increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.

An asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.

[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.

Only time will tell...

As of the end of 2019, Berkshiere Hathaway held positions in 49 seperate companies which is up from 46 during the third quarter of 2019. Some new positions are so small they are almost not even worth mentioning.  
Nonetheless, Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio remains on of the best ways to identify which stocks Warren Buffet feels are worth looking into.  
In early April, Buffet has reduced his bet on airlines as the industry reeled from the conoavirus-led collapse in air travel. Berkshire disclosed share sales in two of his four airline stocks : Southwest(4.3%) and Delta air lines. (18%)

  
According to a SEC filing published a few weeks ago, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold about $30 million worth of Bank of New York Mellon stock.

Volatile as in the difference between the high and low for the year.

**Intra-Year High Divided by Intra-Year Low**

Contractions 1934 - 2020 (partial year) average = 38% (49% including Depression years)

Expansions 1934-2020 (partial year) average = 25%

**Intra-Year High + Intra-Year Low Average, Growth Over Prior Year**

A coronavirus vaccine trial by University of Oxford researchers aims to get efficacy results by September, and manufacturing is already underway.

It really bothers me when I don’t understand something; what drives me insane is when something happens that is the exact opposite of what I think should be happening.  The current divergence between the US stock market and the economy is one such conundrum.  Judging by the conversations I’ve been having lately with some really smart people, it feels like I’m not the only one.

Why is the market rising?

Yesterday I had some really cool conversations with Arvind Ravishunkar and Craig Weinstein that brought us to a potential answer; one that now makes me think that what is happening is actually rational.  I have no idea if our theories are correct; I just thought they were interesting enough to write it down and share it and potentially get a discussion going.

These are just ideas that I hope help any of you as it helped me.

So, what’s actually going on?  The US equities market S&amp;P500 index hit a closing high on February 19th 2020 of 3,386.15.  At one point on March 23rd, it had dropped to 2237.  Why did the market drop so far so quickly? I believe it was because the shutdown of the world economy, and specifically the US economy, put the possibilities of mass bankruptcies on the table due to a potential liquidity crisis. This realization that the equity value of billion dollar companies across industries in oil and gas, retail, banking, and many others could go to zero in a matter of weeks led to an unprecedented flight from the stocks of these companies.  It made total sense why investors were scared.  Most enterprise companies in the S&amp;P500 require continuous liquidity, I.e. access to short term debt, to run day to day operations.  If demand-side shocks cause revenue to go close to zero (stay-at-home orders), then they would need access to cash fast to cover fixed expenses, debt payments, and critical operational expenses.  The amount of cash available through traditional bank and debt (bond) channels would be unable to serve the trillions needed, which means these enterprise companies would be out of business due to the lack of oxygen (cash).  

That’s when the FED did something even more unprecedented than the pandemic itself, they came out and provided huge amounts (trillions) of liquidity, and essentially bankrolled the economy at a scale that has never been done before.  They also didn’t discriminate, and decided to provide liquidity to everyone that could have a contagion impact; banks, mortgage backed securities, high grade corporate debt, low grade corporate debt, and Main Street lending.  The low grade corporate debt was the real signal that no matter what happens the Federal reserve would allow no company to fail due to lack of liquidity.  It was with this statement, that no company would fail due to lack of liquidity, that made the market make the following statement.

“With bankruptcies off the table, and the Fed showing an unlimited appetite to provide liquidity for an undetermined amount of time, then investors could take a longer look out at the economy, potentially even 18 months out, and take the chance that most companies will be around to service demand when it returns in mid 2021.”

Essentially, the market is willing to dismiss the earnings of the next 12 months, and look at earnings 18-24 months out. Since there seems to be no short term impact to an eventual 10-15 Trillion Fed balance sheet, it made more sense to park money in equities than it was to put money into short and long term debt that will average a 1% return.  This happened even though the Feds actions are deflationary, because it keeps supply (businesses producing more) at a growth level higher than demand (consumers who want to spend). 

At the same time, the Fed also bought up the debt of the US Government, ensuring that interest rates remain close to zero so that the US government can continue to service its own increasing deficit, and increased dollar-swap lines so emerging markets could do the same.

So what are the risks that could drive the US equity market down from here?

1. Any uncertainty that the Fed has changed its position and that unlimited liquidity is off the table.  That would mean that debt liquidity could evaporate, leaving companies back to going to zero.
2. That the only market bigger than the debt market, the FX market, changes direction and decides that they don’t want to service their debt in dollars, and the counter parties agree. Then the Fed would lose control of interest rates, as the demand for dollars plummets, forcing an increase in interest rates to raise the demand for dollars.
3. Demand (from consumers) remains structurally depressed past 12 months.

\#3 is really interesting here, because I think #1 and #2 have a low probability.  During an election year, there is no way Trump will turn off the debt spigot, and if Biden wins, he wont have the political capital to do it either.  For #2, I think this **will** happen, but closer to 2026, when debt levels accelerate worldwide towards 1000% of GDP (rather than the 300-600% it is today).

So if #3 happens, I think the Fed will move directly to lending to the consumer.  Opening up term loans to consumers would of course put all banks out of business, so they would do this by buying consumer debt directly from the banks.  This would drive the cost (interest rate) of revolving credit down to the single digits, allowing consumers to load up on debt faster than ever before, spurring an unprecedented period of growth.  It is this that will eventually lead to scenario #2, because as the world debts level topple themselves over, they will have no choice but to abandon their dollar-denominated debt, which then would contagion into hyperinflation into the USA, which the Fed would be powerless to stop.

So, that’s what we’ve come up with.  It is perfectly rational for the US equity market to rise because of the fact that the market has a) no place to earn a higher return to put trillions of investable cash to work and b) the feds actions have taken the risk to zero off the table, allowing investors the ability to ignore the next 12 months and focus on the next 18-24 months, keeping businesses afloat while demand has time to come back to February 2020 levels.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,386509,public,confidence,self,Why the market is rising in the early cycle of a pandemic (my thoughts),0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g3xf20/why_the_market_is_rising_in_the_early_cycle_of_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another day brought another sell-side upgrade on Tuesday for Tesla, the $130bn electric vehicle manufacturer that sometimes sells solar panels.

This time it was Dan Levy of Credit Suisse’s turn to shift his numbers on a business whose share price has, for most of this year, defying the laws of financial physics.

In the note, Levy upgraded Tesla to “neutral” and moved his price target from $415 to $580 on the back of the company’s apparent first-mover advantage in the EV space. Here are a few key snippets:

 

&gt;It \[Tesla\] competitively has more of an edge in the long-term transition to EV as coronavirus disruption will make it more difficult for legacy automakers to balance the longer term shift to EV in the face of near-term cycle disruption.  
&gt;  
&gt;A number of legacy automakers have argued in recent years they can maintain commitment to product investment through a cycle, and that in doing so, they are structurally better companies. However, it is quite clear that the coronavirus disruption is an extraordinary circumstance, and all players in the industry are being forced to take action to conserve cash. We have already heard of reports that GM is suspending development work on some of its programs (albeit still pushing ahead on its new EV portfolio), and we suspect the same will likely apply to other automakers.  
&gt;  
&gt;To be fair, EV investment by legacy automakers will need to remain on track. The development cycle for new vehicles is long (3-4 years), and legacy automakers still have the long-term challenges of meeting emission regulations + catching up with Tesla in EV product. The pivot to electrification is existential at VW, GM has highlighted electrification as central to its strategy3 , and Mach-E is a crucial product to Ford. Yet we would imagine that coronavirus disruption will cause at least some impact to legacy automaker EV development.  
Moreover, whereas the argument in the past was that legacy automakers had more resources to attack EV than Tesla, those resources are now narrowed, at least somewhat – coronavirus will drive cash burn and reduce liquidity buffers.

 

These are all sound arguments. For instance in the past month, as the pandemic has infected the bond markets, we’ve seen Ford’s credit rating downgraded to junk, while Moody’s has placed GM on review for a possible downgrade. Liquidity, therefore, is at a premium, and with electric vehicles still being an unprofitable exercise for most, it makes sense to cut back the capital spending there first to conserve cash.

In theory, and we stress the theory part, this should mean Tesla can maintain its electric vehicle lead when factories re-open, and buyers return to the market.

In reality, however, the numbers we do have on market share tell us something different.

In Europe this year, there’s been a wave of Tesla competitors entering the market for the first time. On the high-end, where the Model S and X used to rule the roost, we’ve had the Audi e-Tron and Porsche Taycan; on the affordable end, there’s the Renault Zoe, the Skoda Citigo-e and the Kia e-Niro to compete with the Model 3.

Now while we don’t have the granular data for sales across the continent, what we do have is the daily *registration* data from Spain, the Netherlands and Norway. (It’s important to note that registration is different to a sale — a loaner car for a local dealer could, for instance, count as a registered vehicle. But in this instance we’ll treat them the same, as Tesla has sold to fleet managers in Europe.)

The Netherlands and Norway are critical markets for Tesla, accounting for over 11 percent of the company’s sales in 2019, so any changes in market share in those countries are indicative of the competitive landscape as it might exist across the world once its rivals begin to fulfil foreign orders.

 

There are obviously a few caveats here: government subsidies for Tesla rolled off in the Netherlands at the end of 2019, meaning a lot of sales were pulled forward from this year to last. So that’ll naturally depress its market share figures for the last quarter.

And, of course, there’s the fact that Tesla’s deliveries tend to be back-loaded towards the end of the quarter, which is when these countries closed down due to coronavirus.

However, the numbers still paint a picture of competitors releasing similarly priced vehicles, and eating into Tesla’s market share. If anything this data, which is arguably the best we have at the moment, suggests that some of those lumbering OEMs have already found a winning formula in the electric vehicle market.

So, to Credit Suisse’s point, it seems it’s not really a question of whether Tesla’s competitors can maintain the transition to electric vehicle production, but if the early shifts in European market share will be reflected across the rest of the world now that production has scaled.

As Tesla has benefitted from a lack of consumer choice over the past decade, it’s hard to see how this won’t be the case once we’re eventually let out of our coronavirus cages.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,386493,public,confidence,self,Tesla’s coronavirus ‘competitive advantage',0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g3wvy1/teslas_coronavirus_competitive_advantage/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary

* We are now in the post-capitalist era.  Markets no longer exist.
* There has been an economic coup.
* The virus was used to create a policy response that popped the Everything Bubble and facilitated cover to place the bankrupt and insolvent economy in receivership.
* The Central Bank cartel is the receiver.
* A managed reorganization is in progress that will allow the economy to re-emerge from receivership but it will not be the same economy.

It also seems like big fish manipulate to bring crash every time.

Big fish (i.e. Banks, rich guys etc) follow these steps -

1. Find a sector or any area of the economy which is untouched for a while.
2. Increase the greed in people about that sector. (e.g. 2008, it was real estate)
3. Keep fetching money from all over the world (in the form of bonds/stocks ) to address this greed.
4. Keep big portion of this money to become richer.
5. Loan remaining money (loans, credit cards etc) to 'non-smart' people. Make more money out of obscene interest.
6. Let people enjoy this money for 5-10 years until they run out an option to even repay partially, and world runs out money to lend more.
7. Crash the economy to make everybody else poor.
8. Tell the world that their money has evaporated.

I was looking at the S&amp;P 500 high low data in Barron's this morning and found it interesting that following the Dotcom peak in 2000, the S&amp;P didn't surpass and maintain that level again until early 2013. January 8, 2013, was the last yearly low below 1,500.

2000/03/24 = 1,527.46 (Dotcom high) 

2002/10/09 = 776.76 (low)

2007/10/09 = 1,565.15 (Housing high)

2009/03/09 = 676.53 (low)

2013/01/08 = 1,457.15 (Last yearly low below 1,500)

2020/02/19 = 3,386.15 (high)

Money is made on the busts. Buying on the highs, like everyone seems to be so strongly advocating now, is a guaranteed way to decimate your returns over long periods of time. The key to success is to load up when things are bad.

Annual returns excluding dividends, rounding.

With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y)

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP)

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**
*****
&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.
*****
&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.
*****
&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.
*****
&gt; “As the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. “The data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.” As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.
*****
&gt; Charts are important
&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.
*****
&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday’s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.
*****
&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen’s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.
*****
&gt; “My [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there’s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,” he said. “I’m not sure we’re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It’s been awesome.”
*****
&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.
*****
&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. “The market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,” he said. “They’ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.”
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.
*****
&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed’s quantitative easing programs. “We’re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,” he said.
*****
&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. “Part of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that’s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,” said Doll.
*****
&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.
*****
&gt; “Its going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,” he said, “This one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that’s defensive in nature is going to perform well.”
*****
&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy’s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.
*****
&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.
*****
&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.
*****
&gt; “I think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,” said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.
*****
&gt; “They won’t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,” he said, “I think that window will close, and we’ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there’s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.”
*****
&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.
*****
&gt; “It’s just a reflection of physical market conditions,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.

# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu

&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).

&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.

&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**

&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!

# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term

&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**

&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**

&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**

&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.

# It’s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)

&gt; It’s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn’t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.

&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn’t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn’t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won’t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.

# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 “Best Six Months,” has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA’s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday’s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.

&gt; April’s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all, 

I'm very new to stock trading but picking it up fast.. always in the past I've picked winning companies and talked about buying stocks over-and-over, but never actually took the initiative to open a D.I acc and start making moves. That ended this year after the current Coronavirus outbreak. Unfortunately, with the high demand it took almost 2 weeks to open my account (as opposed to the 1-2 business days advertised), so I lost a lot of potential profit in my current positions had I of gotten them on the day I tried to open the account. Oh well.  


That being said, I need your help. If at any time you see something wrong with what I'm doing, please educate me!   


I made a lot of different moves, but the one I want advice on is with Amazon. I originally bought 1 share @ $2,130.84, but then I realized ""oh shit, everyone is at home buying, q1 earnings are gonna be through the roof and I need a bigger position"", so I sold off some other stocks to free up cash and bought another 2 shares @ $2,221.20.. the first share was purchased in my Canadian account.. and then I realized, oh shit, Canadian dollar is getting obliterated and USD is going up.. so I bought the second wave of shares in my USD account. (I also transferred every share I bought in CAD over to my American account after realizing this, exchange was 1.403 at the time, no commission fee for switching them over).. the idea was that if USD goes to $1.45 and CAD .67 (for example), then on top of my investments earnings i make about $0.07 per dollar on the exchange back to CAD - (minus commission fee on cash exchange), is this correct? Anyways, so then I learned about swingtrading.. I already had fairly large positions throughout my portfolio, so I thought, hmm.. what if I start swingtrading to increase cash. I bought another 2 shares of Amazon @ $2390.27, and planned to sell @ $2450 for profit, or $2350 stop loss.. this was an experiment.. and stupid me bought it in the same account.. so I thought I'd be able to sell those 2 new shares individually, but now they're just all together as 5 shares.. I did a bit of research and apparently it's called Rupee Cost Averaging? Except you're supposed to buy more when the share goes lower than your original investment to bring down your avg. and increase longterm profit by increasing your position and decreasing share purchase price avg.   


Because I've done it this way, swingtrading is now impossible to experiment with, and I'm really struggling with the math on all this. My original avg. on 3 shares was $2176.02, Current Average: $**2247.4433 (5 shares).** Amazon went down to $2330 today and I was really getting worried I lost a lot of money and screwed up my potential earnings with the original 3 stock position that i got for much cheaper, but it went back up to $2380 after hours and I started doing the math and realized overall I was still making more profit even with the stock being down $10 from where i bought the new shares. $51 profit increase over the old position even with the -$10/share. So it took me a tedious amount of time but I ended up realizing that my break even point on the new position is around $2354-$2355/share.. but I wasnt able to find the exact break even point and it took a lot of simpleton math.

But I’ve finally landed on my final stocks to either hold or sell when the boom hits but I’m unsure of which way to go with all 3.

It is essential to have a set of **written** trading rules that determine **what to buy, when to buy, when to sell...** This is the big first step towards profitability and consistency. Having a proper trading plan is key to managing your emotions as it allows you to make decisions before hand with a calm mind.

**And no ""buy low sell high"" does not count as a trading plan**, neither does picking up tips on twitter.

I've started a Youtube series on my channel where I will post a video going over key sections of trading rules that are essential.

Sections I will cover:

**Determining the General Market Trend**

**Going Long**

* **Stock Selection**
* **Setups + Position Sizing**
* **Risk Management**

**Going Short**

* **Stock Selection**
* **Setups + Position Sizing**
* **Risk Management**

**Post Analysis + Record Keeping**

**Glossary + Indicators**

I will be providing and explaining each section of my own trading rules to serve as an example of how specific you should be. 

**I just posted the introduction/General market trend video. I encourage you to check it out and leave feedback:**

My first question being what would be the best site to use. I'd like to invest in travel agencies, event organizing companies and possibly in XRP, since I heard that it would be a good long term investment. I heard that robinhood was good but you need to use multible apps to see all of the info needed for trading. Also heard about Ameritrade being a good site for begginers.  
Secondly, is it a good idea to invest right now? I read a little bit about the current stock market and some people think that stocks will now continually start rising but others think another dip is coming.

A Georgia senator who’s accused of insider trading on coronavirus information has been named to President Trump’s task force on reopening America.

Sen. Kelly Loeffler says she’s looking forward to pitching in on the panel to help “get Americans back to work safely.""

Loeffler, a strong Trump supporter, is one of several GOP lawmakers flagged for making suspicious stock transactions shortly after receiving official briefings about the staggering potential impact of the pandemic.

A wealthy investor, Loeffler made millions of dollars of trades in stocks at a time when the public, and other shareholders, were in the dark about the extent of the economic carnage the virus was expected to cause.

She contends that she did nothing wrong and says all the trades were made by a financial adviser who knew nothing about her inside info on coronavirus.

But she later moved to sell all her holdings in stock of individual companies, which rivals called a “guilty plea” to accusations of improper trades.

Besides Loeffler, GOP Sen. Richard Burr (R-North Carolina) is also under serious pressure to resign over coronavirus insider trading accusations.

He is reportedly facing a criminal investigation for dumping stocks after getting a secret briefing about the pandemic and while he reassured the public that there was little to worry about.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,384923,public,confidence,self,‘Insider trading’ senator named to Trump’s ‘reopen America’ coronavirus task force,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g2xwmo/insider_trading_senator_named_to_trumps_reopen/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'pTAoiFwwD9IHjf9UiLtjYVMiL8NoEOVA8RYZ69V9UEw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_3x2QdStt3Ft8XCG9I-6DCsS61RreICg6CCJ-zdwuUU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c535c71c3b9b121a7b1110b3aebfc07144e0578', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_3x2QdStt3Ft8XCG9I-6DCsS61RreICg6CCJ-zdwuUU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f678e8f67b223d8107e4165f6747dbe07e4524f', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_3x2QdStt3Ft8XCG9I-6DCsS61RreICg6CCJ-zdwuUU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3a5d8dcf0ef571feda238f41f83b12fe067eb19', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_3x2QdStt3Ft8XCG9I-6DCsS61RreICg6CCJ-zdwuUU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b6d661412c71c8a8f75bafd5fd075e0f839144', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_3x2QdStt3Ft8XCG9I-6DCsS61RreICg6CCJ-zdwuUU.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c8777a613c1594de604812c79807d7d8c2440d2', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_3x2QdStt3Ft8XCG9I-6DCsS61RreICg6CCJ-zdwuUU.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5dd1b9e4affdd041506f8d6059e5f900f8539be', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 800, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_3x2QdStt3Ft8XCG9I-6DCsS61RreICg6CCJ-zdwuUU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=7399ddade74ae34c422dd817c4b6880c0a278db6', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

What should I be looking to do with it currently? What to invest in? What platforms to use?

So far I am thinking long term stock investments with the majority of my money. 

I know the market was super low and is slowly rebounding, but still volatile. I have been researching and looking into stocks i'm completely new to this. So far I really like the idea of dropping money into large companies with a good footing that should eventually recover, or have the highest chance of eventually recovering to where they were before the crash with coronavirus. I read on here some companies may not recover fully and if they do it could take 5 years. Im still young so I feel comfortable holding some for 5 years and more. 

Im thinking airline companies like delta, southwest, united, american, and maybe boeing, although I believe boeing is a bit more high risk with the issues they've been having with their planes.  what are your thoughts on airline companies?

I have also been looking at Visa and Mastercard. AMD( which is at basically its highest point ever I believe so I should wait for a drop before buying id think) , BAM( brookfield asset management), Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, AT&amp;T,  and BRK.B Berkshire Hathaway seems to be a very safe buy and looks to be a decent buying point. 

What about oil? Shell, chevron, Exxon? likely to recover 5 years from now?

&amp;#x200B;

Ive heard from many many people that its imperative that I diversify. This would mean 10k$ in 10 different stocks would be a much better option than 20k$ in 5 stocks or 50k$ in two stocks? Or should I split even more?

&amp;#x200B;

Action I have taken so far: 

 I have taken a small 300$ into robin hood to attempt swing trading. I know it is high risk especially on these volatile companies but I am willing to risk losing small amounts if it means I am learning. Currently with the 300$ I bought one share of PYPL (paypal), 5 shares of BAC (bank of america). and put limit orders on activision and penn gaming for a couple shares each. 

I am also going to order a book tonight. I was recommended a random walk down wall street and the neatest little guide. Which is better for a beginner?

The idea: With many industries experiencing extreme lows in stock price, what would happen if I invest in a portfolio of say 20-30 companies that are highly likely to bounce back eventually (airlines/cruise lines etc), buy each one when they’re experiencing a down day, and completely sell off each one on the first up day. Rinse and repeat, wait until the stock waivers back down, reinvest, and sell the next day they’re up. 

It would seem like the risk is highly mitigated, because even if they are down for several days weeks, or months, it’s likely they they’ll at least start to show positive results as COVID disappears (6,12,24 months).

I understand this stimulus package is quite unprecedented in terms of speed and size, but I'm still curious how historical bear market rallies have played out.

I've read that in both '01 and '08 there was at least  one +20% rally after the initial drop.  How long did these rallies last?  Following these rallies I assume there was a retest or breaking of previous lows?

I'm quite new to investing and have a relatively small sum of money accessible (30K), but would still like to learn to make the right plays today and to best prepared in the many invested years leading to retirement.

Again, quite new, but I feel there is still much to be bearish about.  Specifically regarding uncertainty in the real estate market, small businesses, international economies, reopening of the economy in short term and again this winter.  I am feeling a bit FOMO as I haven't yet got my money in in 2020.  If there is likely significant time left on a rally/this is the rally to bring us up than I'd invest for shorter/longer term now, but I can't help the feeling that a retest of the lows awaits while there is so much uncertainty outside of the blue-chip businesses.

I hope this can stimulate a good discussion!",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,384655,public,confidence,self,Bear Market Rallies Historically?,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g2iqvl/bear_market_rallies_historically/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

&gt; Could we retest the March lows? This is the key question on investors' minds and a concern that's been keeping many conservative buyers on the sidelines.
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier this week, Bank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey for the month of April revealed that fund managers have increased their cash positions to 5.9 per cent, the highest level since the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred.
&gt; 
&gt; And it's not just institutional money managers who are cautious; individual investors are also wary of the recent relief rally in equity markets.
&gt; 
&gt; According to sentiment data from the American Association of Individual Investors released last week, nearly half of investors - 45 per cent - are bearish, well above the historical average of 31 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; Worries include the depth of the recession, the speed of a recovery and the possibility of a second coronavirus outbreak occurring as people return to work and their daily activities.
&gt; 
&gt; In determining whether the market has likely put in a bottom, one good reference point is the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX. It reflects future movements anticipated in the stock market.
&gt; 
&gt; Generally, the VIX and the stock market move in opposite directions. When the VIX falls, stock markets rise. We have seen this play out in recent weeks. As of April 15, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index has rallied 24 per cent from its March 23 low - a strong and swift recovery with small- and large-cap stocks both participating relatively equally. At the same time, the VIX has steadily declined after peaking above 80 in mid-March. On Tuesday, the VIX dipped below 40 for the first time in more than a month.
&gt; 
&gt; That being said, the VIX is still extremely high, reflecting heightened risks that remain in the stock market.
&gt; 
&gt; While a lot of unknowns still exist, panic and forced selling activity have diminished and we seem to have entered into a phase of less emotional and more rational trading.
&gt; 
&gt; As such, I do not expect markets will return to the March lows, nor do I expect volatility to spike like it did in March, when circuit breakers were triggered.
&gt; 
&gt; However, given the recent rally, it's going to be important to be selective in which stocks to invest in during this period of economic uncertainty, with a health crisis that is far from over.
&gt; 
&gt; During a normal earnings season, outperformers usually report better-than-expected financial results and robust future earnings growth. But we are not in a normal business environment. Businesses are closed and consumers are staying at home.
&gt; 
&gt; With this very atypical earnings season just beginning, balance sheet strength, market leadership and evidence of earnings stability will become increasingly important - that is, evidence of how well a company can withstand a recession.
&gt; 
&gt; Investors will reward stocks with growth - just look at Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (WMT), which have both closed at record highs this week. Here are two examples of Canadian stocks that feature these attractive attributes needed in today's environment.
&gt; 
&gt; The first is Kinaxis Inc. (KXS), a provider of cloud-based software for managing supply chains, which closed at a record high on Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; With the COVID-19 pandemic, this company has three attractive attributes that are helping lift the share price higher - strong earnings visibility, rising potential e-commerce demand and a solid balance sheet.
&gt; 
&gt; The company has a subscription-based model with its customers typically entering into agreements that span between two and five years, with annual payments collected in advance, making the majority of the company's total revenue quite predictable.
&gt; 
&gt; Kinaxis has a healthy balance sheet. As at Dec. 31, the company had US$213-million in cash and short-term investments, or more than US$8 a share.
&gt; 
&gt; The second is Jamieson Wellness Inc. (JWEL), a small-cap consumer staples stock whose share price closed at a record high on Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; The company manufactures and distributes natural health products, with Jamieson the best-selling brand by sales in Canada within the vitamins, minerals and supplements market.
&gt; 
&gt; Individuals have placed a greater focus on personal health during the pandemic, which has translated into strong demand for Jamieson products and rising revenue for the company.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, management maintained its guidance, still anticipating year-over-year earnings growth in 2020. Management is forecasting adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to be between $80-million and $84-million in 2020, up from $75.9million reported in 2019.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the bottom line: This is a stock pickers' market. Invest in companies with strong balance sheets, those that are dominant industry players with earnings stability and growth. Furthermore, look at a company's earnings potential further out into 2021 and beyond, and be mindful of a shift in consumer behaviour and business investment.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,384574,public,confidence,self,Jennifer Dowty BA CFA: Why markets won’t retest March lows (and two TSX stocks to buy for these unsettling times).,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g2grqs/jennifer_dowty_ba_cfa_why_markets_wont_retest/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'dyacqqd8xSakdgtCG8BEAikh-i4EispIxNwkvdRmapU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 86, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZddcQP_XoTH8HeBW46dK3-i4khz5u9JLDUd8Aiw4R4w.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae9e5686984cee6c4344528a6602bc91a9bbbaea', 'width': 108}, {'height': 172, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZddcQP_XoTH8HeBW46dK3-i4khz5u9JLDUd8Aiw4R4w.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6982eb0522f69ff1f5635e0f3aa072ef8a2450e1', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 200, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZddcQP_XoTH8HeBW46dK3-i4khz5u9JLDUd8Aiw4R4w.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=58600966c392d97cae3c214ec378f88dcb8a49cc', 'width': 250}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,1587051438.0,,,,,,,,,

This is my understanding of an ETF like SPY or VOO: It’s an entity that decides to invest in a ton of different stocks. Then, ownership of the entity is traded on public exchanges. 

This is my understanding of a conglomerate like Berkshire or Pepsi: It’s an entity that decides to buy a ton of private companies. Then, the entity is traded on public exchanges. 

How are these different? What I’m really trying to get at is that many people ignore the P/E ratio of an ETF, but they wouldn’t ignore the P/E ratio of a conglomerate. This seems dumb to me. Many ETFs now have P/E ratios upwards of 70 and it seems dangerous as a value investor.
