He says that diversification is for the ignorant investor (and there is nothing negative about this). It helps people spread their money across different businesses to help avoid losses in one area if the market/business is performing badly. By diversifying, you are reducing your risk of loss because all of your eggs are not in one basket.

However, he says its truly due to the lack of understanding of the good businesses. For example, if you are certain that company A will perform well and you have done your research, then why not put your (for example) $20,000 investment in that company. To spread it out over multiple companies would be foolish because you are not maximizing your potential returns. By spreading it out over multiple businesses that you do not fully understand, you are not maximizing your returns.

I would put the link to the video but then this post gets considered as spam and gets removed. Just look up ""warren buffet diversification"" on Youtube. It is 7 minutes long. No it is not my channel and I am not gaining any views from sharing this. Just wanted to start a discussion.

At the meeting on March 13, which has not been previously reported, Fed officials were told by four bank employees that little had changed within the bank’s culture since the scandal that engulfed Wells Fargo almost three years ago.

Among those present at the meeting was Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is overseeing a decree requiring that Wells Fargo fix its risk management before it can resume growing, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The employees belonged to an advocacy group, Committee For Better Banks, which confirmed the meeting.

Brainard told the group she was there to listen and get insight into the mood among Wells Fargo staff but declined to say if or how the Fed would respond, the sources said.

While regulators occasionally meet with consumer advocacy or industry groups, it is unusual for a Fed board member to meet with an individual firm’s employees. It is not clear who asked for the meeting.

Sloan abruptly departed the bank last month, making him the second CEO to leave Wells Fargo in the wake of its sales practice scandal. Sloan, who declined to comment on this story through a representative, has previously said he stepped down because he felt the external attention on him had become a distraction.

His departure was at least partly the result of the board’s conclusion that Sloan had failed to convince regulators that he could transform the bank and rally a staff that had low confidence in its leadership, according to a source with knowledge of the board’s thinking.

Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk declined to comment on regulatory matters but disputed the employee group’s characterization of the bank’s culture.

Sloan’s struggles underscore the challenges faced by the bank’s next chief executive. They will not only have to transform the bank and its sales practices, but also persuade regulators and its 260,000 employees that they have done so.

Finding a new CEO who can win over the bank’s employees is as important as finding someone who can charm regulators and Wall Street, said Russell Raath, president of management consulting firm Kotter.

“The whole bank needs to know that this person cares about their contribution to the top and bottom line,” he said.

STRAINED RELATIONSHIP

Wells Fargo’s relationship with regulators has been strained since 2016, when employee whistleblowers revealed the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.

Internal and regulatory probes have since discovered other issues in the bank’s businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines and penalties.

In February 2018, Wells Fargo signed a Fed consent order that required the bank to fix its risk-management and governance problems before it could grow its balance sheet.

Two months later, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Wells Fargo’s other key regulator, ordered the bank to make similar fixes and repay customers to whom it had improperly sold mortgages and auto insurance.

In December, Reuters reported that the Fed had rejected the bank’s initial remediation plan, putting it behind schedule. Days later, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress the Fed would not lift the asset cap until it was satisfied that Wells Fargo had fixed its risk problems.

LOW MORALE

An internal company-wide survey around that time also pointed to low morale, according to the Committee For Better Banks and other Wells Fargo employees.

The bank internally published a write-up about the survey, saying Wells Fargo found itself at a “challenging and interesting” crossroads. Some employees felt that the description sugar-coated the findings, sources said.

That sparked dozens of comments from workers criticizing management for being out of touch, according to the sources and screenshots of the internal site reviewed by Reuters.

A consumer loan underwriter complained on the internal site that the concerns about pay and employee benefits were falling on deaf ears.

“For years (team members) have been expressing their concerns and frustrations,” the employee wrote. “The only response (if any) are canned answers and talking points which we all know is baloney.”

An analysis of the survey Wells Fargo published publicly showed only 38 percent of employees felt senior management understood obstacles faced by frontline workers.

Wells Fargo’s Folk said the company seeks and values input from employees, and that the bank has already made a number of improvements based on the feedback.

He pointed to other categories in the survey that showed employees believed in the bank’s values and were satisfied. For example, 72 percent of employees said they believe Wells Fargo is a good place to work.

REGULATORY REBUKE

Sloan testified before Congress on March 12 in a hearing about the bank’s progress since 2016.

As a gesture of goodwill, Wells Fargo took the unusual step of offering the OCC the opportunity to review his testimony in advance, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. It is unclear how the OCC responded.

In his testimony, Sloan detailed Wells Fargo’s extensive transformation efforts, but regulators remained skeptical.

Sloan had barely finished speaking when the OCC said it was still “disappointed” by the bank’s remediation efforts.

The next day, after Wells Fargo disclosed Sloan had gotten a 5 percent pay raise, the Fed responded that it expects boards “to hold management accountable.”

A week later, Powell told reporters the bank had suffered a “remarkably widespread series of breakdowns” that needed to be addressed in a “fundamental” way.

These rebukes undermined Sloan’s position at the bank, the source with knowledge of the board’s thinking said.

On March 26, Sloan told the board he had decided to resign, according to a regulatory filing. Three days later, he publicly stepped down.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Hello,

I'm a college student who found out my loan broker does not properly apply money into principal. So I decided to stop dumping money into my loans and move it to stocks (and MMAs?) for the remainder of my degree. I'm new to stocks but I've dealt with the subject a bit and familiar with the basics. My goal:

* Make as much of a profit in 2 years to pay off student loans
* Not be super risky (e.g. no penny stocks)
* Use a tool that makes it easy to figure out my taxes (possibly through the broker itself)
* Take up much advice as I can here so I can continue to invest in the future

What broker should I use? I'm also thinking of focusing on the tech field to invest in, but maybe credit sharks as well.

* Use a tool that makes it easy to figure out my taxes (possibly through the broker itself)
* Take up much advice as I can here so I can continue to invest in the future

I've compiled a pros and cons list to decide which stock is a better choice to invest in:

Aurora Cannabis

Pros:
• 2nd largest weed company in revenue 
• Has 11 growing facilities
• Ability to produce 500k kilos of marijuana per yr
• Operates in 24 countries (large global presence)
• Holds 9 acquisitions (primary source of growth)
• Activist Investor Nelson Peltz has been named strategic advisor to Aurora Cannabis Inc.'s board to help with global expansion ambitions

Cons: 
• Paid for many acquisitions with shares of stocks, warrants, convertible notes, and options (1 bn outstanding shares) --&gt; low earnings per share 
• Has no partners while its competitors do
• Overpaying for their acquisition transactions
• Extract and per gram prices dropping annually

Canopy Growth 

Pros: 
• Largest producer of Weed/revenue for weed companies 
• In Canada, Canopy has signed a deal with each of the country's 10 provinces and has an agreement with the Yukon territory
• Operates in 11 countries 
• Holds 8 acquisitions
• Is partnered with Constellation, which owns alcoholic brands, such as Modello and Corona 

Cons:
• Canopy's share count is up to 75%, and with 107.9 million warrants as well as 31.6 million stock options, there's a good likelihood of a much higher outstanding share count in the future --&gt; lower earnings per share
• Dried cannabis flower is susceptible to per gram price decreases over time
• Overpaying for their acquisition transactions 

Given this information, it's clear that Canopy Growth is on the safer side. Though both companies will grow with time, I want to know what price I should purchase shares at. Rn Canopy Growth is at $43.24 and Aurora Cannabis is at $9.17. 

Question: What price should I consider investing in Canopy Growth or Aurora Cannabis? Canopy Growth is at $43.24 and Aurora Cannabis is at $9.17 rn. Also, if you have purchased either stock please explain why you chose one over the other thx. :)

Long time lurker, first post (on this sub, anyway ;)... ) I am working on a product by which gathering company, or industry intelligence can be automated through analysis of patent applications. There's a lot of 'real' information in patents which doesn't show up anywhere else, so the initial idea was that this type of analysis would help to easily identify industry trends, emerging technologies, significant new players in each segments, and what industries or technologies each company's betting on. That is, who's leading new emerging technologies and who's still investing in somewhat out-dated tech.

We've put together a demo output here on [demo1.hindsights.io](https://demo1.hindsights.io/). The amount of outputs are a little limited for a demo, but obviously can be extended in almost any dimension.

Given your knowledge &amp; enthusiasm in this area, it'd be great to get your feedback:

1. Do you see this being useful for stock research?
2. Do you use (or have you used) any kind of similar tools?
3. Would you pay for a subscription service to something like this? (and how much?)
4. Does this meet or solve any problems/frustrations you've previously had?

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 8th, 2019.

# **Key data could end or defend recession fears as stocks notch best quarter in a decade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/first-quarter-earnings-are-expected-to-be-lousy-but-stock-market-may-not-care.html)**
*****
&gt; The worst earnings season in nearly three years is about to begin, but stock strategists say the market should be able to look right past declining profits and continue to reach for all-time highs, as long as trade talks between the U.S. and China continue to show progress.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, on the prospect that the trade talks would ultimately lead to a deal that could end punitive tariffs and boost earnings growth. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2% for the week, at 2,892 and is just about 1.6% from its all-time high of 2,940, reached in September.
*****
&gt; Among the first major companies to report are J.P. Morgan Chaseand Wells Fargo, both on Friday. In addition to earnings, investors will be watching Wednesday for minutes from the last Fed meeting; CPI inflation data also on Wednesday; and any headlines on trade or the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" from the European Union.
*****
&gt; As for earnings, Refinitiv expects a 2.2% decline in first-quarter profits for the S&amp;P 500 companies, but those lower results are expected to be the trough. Earnings growth is projected to rebound to 2.8% in the second quarter and by as much as 9% in the fourth quarter. The first-quarter decline would be the first negative earnings period since the second quarter of 2016.
*****
&gt; ""The second, third and fourth quarter will show a rebound.That's supportive of higher equity prices,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ""I was thinking I'd like to see a record for the whole year, and it looks like we might do better than that.""
*****
&gt; 'Picture much brighter'
Keon said there are risks, including whether there really is a trade deal with China over the next couple of weeks and whether China's economy is really bottoming. ""Is the success of China's stimulus gong to to continue and spread to other countries? To me, the picture is much brighter than it was a couple months ago,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said any number of factors could be the catalyst to push stocks to records, including earnings season, if companies beat lowered guidance and their outlooks are good. Stocks could also ride higher on a better outlook for the U.S. economy, after a batch of better data including Friday's March jobs report.
*****
&gt; ""I think maybe we end up getting to a new high sometime early in the second quarter, and then maybe we do some sideways moving in that 'sell in May' period,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""I think we confirm that 10th anniversary of this bull market by hitting a new all-time high. Then we digest some of those gains and move sideways for a bit and let some of those earnings catch up, and then maybe there's a year-end advance.""
*****
&gt; Also in the week ahead, investors are watching for the minutes from the Fed's last meeting, scheduled to be released Wednesday afternoon. At that meeting, the Fed released revised forecasts, with no rate hikes now expected in 2019 and a slower growth outlook. The minutes should also show what Fed officials were considering when they decided to end the program to roll down their balance sheet, and bond traders are looking for clues on which type of Treasurys the Fed will hold in its balance sheet.
*****
&gt; On the data front, there are CPI consumer inflation data Wednesday and producer price inflation on Thursday. Both of these indexes should be closely watched since wage gains were muted in Friday's March jobs report, and strategists said they see no sign of inflation on the horizon. The Fed also sees below-trend inflation, so any unexpected change would be important.
*****
&gt; The U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union will continue to make headlines in the week ahead. The Council of the European Union meets Wednesday, and will consider the U.K.'s request to extend the Brexit deadline, originally this coming Friday.
*****
&gt; ""It could go in any number of directions. The thing we've been telling people is if it's a messy, hard Brexit, the big difference between now and three years ago is you'd get a big chunk of that safe haven flow into U.S. dollars,"" said Michael Schumacher, director, rate strategy at Wells Fargo. Schumacher said investors would be more inclined to move into the short end of the Treasury curve, rather than into German bunds, which have negative yields.

# Big First Quarter Gains Undoubtedly Bullish

&gt; Well the big gains of Q1 are in the books and after the nastiness in Q4 it’s reassuring to see the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle returning to form and delivering solid gains. The Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle runs from Q4 of the Midterm Election Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year for with an average gain of 21.1% for the S&amp;P 500 over the 3-quarter span. The S&amp;P 500 gained 13.1% in 2019 Q1, but it lost 14.0% in 2018 Q4 and is still down -2.7% for the Sweet Spot so far.

&gt; But, nevertheless, this type of gain for the S&amp;P 500 in Q1 is undoubtedly bullish. The S&amp;P 500’s gain for 2019 Q1 is the 26th best quarterly gain for the index since 1930, 7thbest Q1 since 1949, largest Q1 gain since 1998 and the top quarterly gain since September 2009.

&gt; As illustrated in the accompanying table the 44 prior times that the S&amp;P 500 was positive in Q1 since 1949 resulted in 40 full-year gains and 4 losses for an average gain of 16.2% and gains for the remaining 9 months of the year 38 times out of 44 year with an average gain of 8.6%. The 18 years with Q1 gains between 5.5% and 13.9% are all followed by full-year gains with the only blemish in geopolitically charged 1956.

&gt; The big black mark came from Black Monday 1987. 1956 was mired by the Hungarian Revolution and the Soviet invasion as well as the Suez Crisis, the Second Arab-Israeli War. 2011 was hindered by the international sovereign debt crisis, the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis and the resulting downgrade of U.S. credit rating. The dotcom bubble popped in the year 2000. Tepid growth and earnings declines created a mini bear in 2015 that bottomed in February 2016. And finally, the 1980-1982 double-dip recessions put U.S. stocks in abear market throughout 1981 that ended in August 1982.

# The Bespoke Report -- Second Quarter Chart Checkup

&gt; Following big market moves like we have seen in the last six months, a number of market characteristics tend to change as some new leadership groups emerge and others fall by the wayside. In order to help get a better idea of what sectors and groups have been driving the market, in this week’s Bespoke Report, we are providing a ‘chart checkup’ of all the S&amp;P 500 Industries as well as providing updates to some key market and economic charts that we feel are important to highlight.

&gt; It was a banner week for US equities and a great encore to a strong first quarter. With the exception of the Dow (DIA), every major index ETF was up over 2%. Value outperformed growth across all three market caps, but the margin between the two was pretty narrow. Defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP) and Utilities (XLU) actually saw modest declines this week, while Materials (XLB), Financials (XLF), Communication Services (XLC), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rallied over 3%. In international markets, China (ASHR) surged over 7%, while Mexico (EWW) bounced over 5%. Australia (EWA) was the only country up less than 1%. Fixed income ETFs saw modest declines across the board.

# Jobs Growth Slows, But Only A Little Bit

&gt; Today's job numbers beat expectations, with 196,000 jobs added and a small positive revision to the prior two months. On a rolling 3 month average, job creation fell to the lowest level in over a year, but only marginally. While jobs growth is still solid, it has cooled a bit. That isn't anything to worry about, but it is something to keep an eye on.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040519-ESR-1.png))**

&gt; Wage growth picked up dramatically last year, with 2016-2018's sideways movement in the year-over-year change of average wages paid surging. Over the last few months that growth has once again been moving sideways, albeit at a much higher rate of growth than we've seen for almost all of the current economic expansion.

&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, on the prospect that the trade talks would ultimately lead to a deal that could end punitive tariffs and boost earnings growth. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2% for the week, at 2,892 and is just about 1.6% from its all-time high of 2,940, reached in September.
*****
&gt; Among the first major companies to report are J.P. Morgan Chaseand Wells Fargo, both on Friday. In addition to earnings, investors will be watching Wednesday for minutes from the last Fed meeting; CPI inflation data also on Wednesday; and any headlines on trade or the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" from the European Union.
*****
&gt; As for earnings, Refinitiv expects a 2.2% decline in first-quarter profits for the S&amp;P 500 companies, but those lower results are expected to be the trough. Earnings growth is projected to rebound to 2.8% in the second quarter and by as much as 9% in the fourth quarter. The first-quarter decline would be the first negative earnings period since the second quarter of 2016.
*****
&gt; ""The second, third and fourth quarter will show a rebound.That's supportive of higher equity prices,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ""I was thinking I'd like to see a record for the whole year, and it looks like we might do better than that.""
*****
&gt; 'Picture much brighter'
Keon said there are risks, including whether there really is a trade deal with China over the next couple of weeks and whether China's economy is really bottoming. ""Is the success of China's stimulus gong to to continue and spread to other countries? To me, the picture is much brighter than it was a couple months ago,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said any number of factors could be the catalyst to push stocks to records, including earnings season, if companies beat lowered guidance and their outlooks are good. Stocks could also ride higher on a better outlook for the U.S. economy, after a batch of better data including Friday's March jobs report.
*****
&gt; ""I think maybe we end up getting to a new high sometime early in the second quarter, and then maybe we do some sideways moving in that 'sell in May' period,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""I think we confirm that 10th anniversary of this bull market by hitting a new all-time high. Then we digest some of those gains and move sideways for a bit and let some of those earnings catch up, and then maybe there's a year-end advance.""
*****
&gt; Also in the week ahead, investors are watching for the minutes from the Fed's last meeting, scheduled to be released Wednesday afternoon. At that meeting, the Fed released revised forecasts, with no rate hikes now expected in 2019 and a slower growth outlook. The minutes should also show what Fed officials were considering when they decided to end the program to roll down their balance sheet, and bond traders are looking for clues on which type of Treasurys the Fed will hold in its balance sheet.
*****
&gt; On the data front, there are CPI consumer inflation data Wednesday and producer price inflation on Thursday. Both of these indexes should be closely watched since wage gains were muted in Friday's March jobs report, and strategists said they see no sign of inflation on the horizon. The Fed also sees below-trend inflation, so any unexpected change would be important.
*****
&gt; The U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union will continue to make headlines in the week ahead. The Council of the European Union meets Wednesday, and will consider the U.K.'s request to extend the Brexit deadline, originally this coming Friday.
*****
&gt; ""It could go in any number of directions. The thing we've been telling people is if it's a messy, hard Brexit, the big difference between now and three years ago is you'd get a big chunk of that safe haven flow into U.S. dollars,"" said Michael Schumacher, director, rate strategy at Wells Fargo. Schumacher said investors would be more inclined to move into the short end of the Treasury curve, rather than into German bunds, which have negative yields.

# Big First Quarter Gains Undoubtedly Bullish

&gt; Well the big gains of Q1 are in the books and after the nastiness in Q4 it’s reassuring to see the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle returning to form and delivering solid gains. The Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle runs from Q4 of the Midterm Election Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year for with an average gain of 21.1% for the S&amp;P 500 over the 3-quarter span. The S&amp;P 500 gained 13.1% in 2019 Q1, but it lost 14.0% in 2018 Q4 and is still down -2.7% for the Sweet Spot so far.

&gt; But, nevertheless, this type of gain for the S&amp;P 500 in Q1 is undoubtedly bullish. The S&amp;P 500’s gain for 2019 Q1 is the 26th best quarterly gain for the index since 1930, 7thbest Q1 since 1949, largest Q1 gain since 1998 and the top quarterly gain since September 2009.

&gt; As illustrated in the accompanying table the 44 prior times that the S&amp;P 500 was positive in Q1 since 1949 resulted in 40 full-year gains and 4 losses for an average gain of 16.2% and gains for the remaining 9 months of the year 38 times out of 44 year with an average gain of 8.6%. The 18 years with Q1 gains between 5.5% and 13.9% are all followed by full-year gains with the only blemish in geopolitically charged 1956.

&gt; The big black mark came from Black Monday 1987. 1956 was mired by the Hungarian Revolution and the Soviet invasion as well as the Suez Crisis, the Second Arab-Israeli War. 2011 was hindered by the international sovereign debt crisis, the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis and the resulting downgrade of U.S. credit rating. The dotcom bubble popped in the year 2000. Tepid growth and earnings declines created a mini bear in 2015 that bottomed in February 2016. And finally, the 1980-1982 double-dip recessions put U.S. stocks in abear market throughout 1981 that ended in August 1982.

# The Bespoke Report -- Second Quarter Chart Checkup

&gt; Following big market moves like we have seen in the last six months, a number of market characteristics tend to change as some new leadership groups emerge and others fall by the wayside. In order to help get a better idea of what sectors and groups have been driving the market, in this week’s Bespoke Report, we are providing a ‘chart checkup’ of all the S&amp;P 500 Industries as well as providing updates to some key market and economic charts that we feel are important to highlight.

&gt; It was a banner week for US equities and a great encore to a strong first quarter. With the exception of the Dow (DIA), every major index ETF was up over 2%. Value outperformed growth across all three market caps, but the margin between the two was pretty narrow. Defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP) and Utilities (XLU) actually saw modest declines this week, while Materials (XLB), Financials (XLF), Communication Services (XLC), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rallied over 3%. In international markets, China (ASHR) surged over 7%, while Mexico (EWW) bounced over 5%. Australia (EWA) was the only country up less than 1%. Fixed income ETFs saw modest declines across the board.

# Jobs Growth Slows, But Only A Little Bit

&gt; Today's job numbers beat expectations, with 196,000 jobs added and a small positive revision to the prior two months. On a rolling 3 month average, job creation fell to the lowest level in over a year, but only marginally. While jobs growth is still solid, it has cooled a bit. That isn't anything to worry about, but it is something to keep an eye on.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040519-ESR-1.png))**

&gt; Wage growth picked up dramatically last year, with 2016-2018's sideways movement in the year-over-year change of average wages paid surging. Over the last few months that growth has once again been moving sideways, albeit at a much higher rate of growth than we've seen for almost all of the current economic expansion.

I looked into the company, all seems well the pay backs on their profit sharing all looked good according to Glass Door in passed years but when I looked at the EMCO stock price it has completely tanked in the last 5 years and even more so since 2008. I understand the recession would hit an Oil &amp; gas Supplier hard but going from $70-80 spiking up to $300 before 2008 then down to $30, and continuing down now to $3.65 in 2019 having only gone down is this something to be worried about with the company going bankrupt? They've been under $30 plenty of times hovering around 15 for years but this is an all time low for them so I'm surprised they're even dishing out positions.  

Maybe I'm reading into the stock price too much, there are 6 or 7 offices in my city of different branches/divisions of EMCO. I know our main customer is a well off Company that has been around forever and is quite business savvy so I don't see them running out of business where we are or closing the office (it's not huge but we mainly service one big customer) 

Anyone have experience with similar? Thanks.

I know this will single out Alaska, for example Monday's daily discussion post will start Sunday at 11pm &amp; 12am Alaska time and Hawaii 9pm &amp; 10pm Hawaii time, so the best I can say is sorry, but I'm sure you guys are used to it already.

Sorry to everyone in Australia, Europe and anyone who speaks English who participated in the these daily &amp; themed posts and never got any responses, now the new time will solve that issue.

Thanks to everyone who have participated in the past and who make r/Stocks a serious, helpful, and informative place to discuss stocks.

I know I posted this late for Australia, but for everyone else who is awake, here's today's daily discussion &amp; fundamentals Friday:

This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme and/or [post your arguments against fundamentals here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+semiannual+arguments+against+TA%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) and not in the current post.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*HOW I USE THIS:\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*BACKGROUND\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

I know there has to be something improbable about the following strategy, otherwise everyone would be a millionaire.

But if you define a maximum loss, L, and a mininum gain, M, what prevents you (or a coded algorithm) from buying a stock, issuing a bracket order with a lower limit of L and upper limit of M, and consistently making low risk profits?

I totally understand that this limits upside since you sell at a certain point regardless of stock momentum, but if you were willing to tolerate a loss of let's say 2% to make 5% gains, and only bought stocks that had positive momentum (which doesn't guarantee increase but makes it likely short term), wouldn't you be able to apply this approach to hundreds of stocks simultaneously and net a profit with minimum risk?

Note that I'm talking about stop loss, not stop loss limit, so the risk of a stock crashing through and missing my sell limit would not apply.

So if your algorithm bought a $1.00 stock and bracketed it at $.98 and $1.05, wouldn't you make money over multiple stocks like this? Obviously this doesn't happen, but what am I missing?

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

I knew they were high but I don’t need this money for 30 or so years and took the “time in the market beats timing the market” to heart.

Disclaimer I am long VICL.

VICL is a shell company. This means it is non active and currently a vehicle for possible financial maneuvers. What’s of interest is the balance sheet as VICL liquidation value is significantly above the price it currently trades. Looking at the balance sheet we need to discount assets that will be difficult to convert to cash. Figures in millions\*

Cash $11,870 - no discount needed. Marketable Sec. $36,201 no discount needed. Receivables and other assets $1,128 - 70% discounted value = $790. Long term investments (bonds) $2,386 - 90% discounted value = $2,147. Equipment + other assets $759 - 30 % discounted value = $227. Total liquidation value of assets - $51,235. Liabilities don’t not get discounted they are almost always the same as listed on balance sheet. Liabilities on balance sheet - $3,581. Total liquidation value $47,654. Total shares outstanding 21,820,195. Per share =$2.18.

Now since company is now a shell cash burn should drop significantly as company isn’t doing much. Cash burn may be slightly over $1 million /year. Very manageable and wont destroy thesis, if company takes time exploring options. We can see a reverse merger similar to GTXI (check chart). Or company liquidates. Worst case company buys new drug candidate, possibly overpays for another business. Overall low risk trade with sizable reward:risk profile. Time line for trade is under a year.

I like the top 10 holdings for each since they have a majority of the same companies (Boeing, Northrop, Raytheon, Lockheed, Harris, General Dynamics, etc).

PPA is trading at $58.76 and ITA is at $202.60, both have similar dividends (PPA 1.38% vs ITA 1.26%) and PE Ratios are both in the low 20's. Only possible determining factor would be the expense ratio:

PPA (.60)
ITA (.43)

What do you guys think? Is the expense ratio difference significant enough to choose ITA? Thanks in advance, cheers!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**Feedback Request**

Given my ""greenness"" in the area of economics, I am very much interested in reading your feedback, whether positive or negative with regards to specific stocks that you see on my picks. Some of you have done this in the past couple of weeks and it has helped me tune the machine learning engines that power my program. 

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

&gt;**A** **photo may generally be worth a thousand words — but can they be worth hundreds of profile visits? In this age of social network authenticity, can old-fashioned stock pictures be worth anything?**

It’s suggested to post on Instgaram between one and three times a day to maximize reach and engagement. That’s a lot of high-quality photography. Many brands, who realize the incredible advantages of growing their business on instagram, don’t have the time or the funds to entreat up that level of creativity. Thankfully, stock picture websites provide an easy opportunity to post excellent filler content on social media.

If done accurately, this can help brands keep impulse with their social media marketing without reducing the overall quality of their account.

In this article, we recommend some tips to assure the best use of stock pictures on Instagram and how this can boost traffic to your website and store.

 

**What Pictures to Choose**

It’s usually suggested to maintain a constant aesthetic throughout your Instagram pictures. This lets you create an engaging profile, build brand awareness and generate a bigger following. Pictures from a low-quality stock photo website are likely to injure your aesthetic and stand out like a bruised thumb.

Thankfully, some websites specialize in issuing high-quality lifestyle stock pictures taken by professional photographers.

Please make sure you only post pictures that you own the rights to. Instagram’s terms and conditions declare that you are responsible for all the content you share. Basically, this means while it’s not breaking their rules to violate copyright, you can still get in legal problem if you’re caught.

 

**How Often to Post Stock Images**

The solution to getting away with using stock pictures on your Instagram account without destroying your account’s aesthetic is to employ them sparingly. Maybe pepper in a stock photo once every four or five posts at the most.

However, with a good selection of stock picture provider, it is possible to add even more quality to your Instagram account without the stress of shooting high-quality images every day.

I am now investing more and trying to build a better portfolio. A few years ago I sold my shares of FB and SNE due to financial reasons and wasn't really able to put more money in until recently. Due to selling off those stocks it made me highly invested in APPL and not having enough diversity. I have finally ben putting more money into my account and invested in a few companies in the past few months. I am trying to put in around $300 monthly. I feel like I should sell off some APPL and get into some other companies to even out my portfolio but I also am hesitant because at the same time want to put more into APPL. Here is my current portfolio. Portfolio total is about $6,500.

APPL - 75.6%
CSCO - 8.2%
MTCH - 4.3%
MOMO - 4.7%
ACB - 2.1%
NOK - 1.7%

Companies I would like to invest in:

DIS
BABA
T
VZ
ERIC
DAL
CVS

I would also want to continue to add more shares to my lower percentage stocks. 
Finally, I am a teacher and have a great retirement plan but feel like it would be a good idea to get into some funds too.

I have been doing a lot of reading and trying to learn more about the entire market and everything it has to offer. Any advice or critiques would be awesome. Thanks

Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

# **Key data could end or defend recession fears as stocks notch best quarter in a decade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/29/data-could-end-or-defend-recession-fears-as-stocks-notch-best-quarter.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks head into the second quarter propelled by the best quarter in nearly a decade as the long tepid IPO market starts to simmer again.
*****
&gt; But the markets also face a reality check in the week ahead with some key data that could help clarify whether the economy is losing steam or just stumbling through a soft patch. The key release is Friday's March jobs report, with economists expecting 170,000 new nonfarm payrolls, after February's deeply disappointing 20,000 jobs, according to Refinitiv. There is also important manufacturing data from China over the weekend and the U.S. on Monday.
*****
&gt; Lyft Inc's big IPO Friday on the back of Levi Strauss the week earlier has boosted some optimism for a year of new offerings that some analysts say could rival or surpass the more than $100 billion record of new issues in the year 2000, if conditions remain good.
*****
&gt; ""The Levi Strauss IPO and the success it had last week encouraged many of these companies to accelerate their timing,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Advisors. ""IPO issuance has been modest relative to history for the last couple of years, so the fact we're finally seeing some companies come to market may signal some kind of optimism or confidence, but it's far from the type of thing we've seen historically in terms of the euphoria surrounding it.""
*****
&gt; Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance said with $700 million in potential offerings in the wings, this year could surpass the all-time record reached in 2000, when the new issue market was viewed as overheated and many companies without earnings or prospects made it into the public arena during the tech bubble.
*****
&gt; ""In general, big IPOs tend to drive general enthusiasm for the overall market until they don't do well,"" said Hogan, noting the follow through trading in Lyft, the biggest IPO since Alibaba went public in 2014. Lyft, priced at $72, surged about 20 percent on the opening but closed up just about 8.7 percent at $78.29.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&amp;P 500 turned in its best first quarter performance since 1998. The 12.9 percent gain was also the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2009, just as the now 10-year-old bull market took off. The S&amp;P is now less than 4 percent from its record high.
*****
&gt; Earnings season kicks off in the next several weeks, and between now and then there could be some high profile warnings on the first quarter, expected to be the first quarter with negative earnings growth in three years.
*****
&gt; Arone said while earnings are expected to be weaker, revenues are expected to grow by nearly 5 percent, a positive sign.
*****
&gt; ""That needs to be reconciled form my perspective. It wouldn't shock me if companies doe better than expected, and end up with positive year-over-year comparisons,"" said Arone.
*****
&gt; Trade talks with China remain the overriding issue for markets. Chinese Vice Premier Lui He comes to Washington to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who traveled to Beijing this past week.
*****
&gt; Analysts expect a deal in the coming months. ""We're likely to get some type of negotiated deal that both sides can claim victory on, where China will buy more U.S. goods, where there is some progress on U.S. intellectual property and technology transfers...But I don't see a deal that's going to be a game changer...a big move in one direction. I think the market has accepted that reality,"" said Arone.
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher but so were bonds, to the point where the 10-year yield reached a low of 2.34 percent before returning to the 2.40 percent level. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The week earlier, the 10-year yield dipped beneath the yield on the 3-month bill, meaning the yield curve was inverted. When that happens and long-term rates are lower than short-term rates, it is viewed as a recession warning. Practically it would mean lenders, who borrow on a short term basis, would be lending at the lower longer term rates.
*****
&gt; The bond market also moved to price in a Fed interest rate cut this year, after pricing in a hike just several months ago. That was in response to the Fed's forecast for no more rate cuts this year, released after its March meeting. It had been forecasting two interest rate hikes previously. The fed funds futures now is priced for a quarter point of easing this year and another next year.
*****
&gt; Markets calmed down as the week came to a close, but every piece of data has become more important. On a positive note, weekly jobless claims data, the most current look at the labor market, showed a downtick and the four week average is now 217,000, the lowest since January.
*****
&gt; The economy's growth definitely slowed down in the first quarter and growth was tracking at about 1.5 percent, after the 2.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter. Economists have expected the weakness in the first quarter, both due to the government shutdown and bad winter weather, to be temporary but the question is whether growth can get a jump start in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; ""The jobs number is key here,"" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley. The February report showed just a tenth of the job creation many economists had expected. ""Our best thinking it it's statistical volatility, and it's not a real indication of what's going on in the labor market, and it will bounce back. That's the most important thing that's coming out next week....We think about 200,000 jobs were added. I think there's some upside risks to that.""
*****
&gt; Tilley said manufacturing data in the week ahead will be important, as it could show whether the sector remained sluggish at the end of the first quarter. March ISM manufacturing and PMI data will be released Monday, and durable goods, which includes business spending data, is important when it is released on Tuesday. Monthly vehicle sales are also released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Economists expect ISM manufacturing at 54.2, unchanged from the month earlier. China was also to release manufacturing PMI data over the weekend.
*****
&gt; February's delayed U.S. retail sales report is also expected on Monday. Retail sales are expected to have gained 0.3 percent in the month, up from 0.2 percent in January and December's shocking decline.
*****
&gt; Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said he's watching for any sign of inflation in wages when the jobs report is released Friday. The Fed's preferred PCE inflation index showed sluggish inflation growth, up just 0.1 percent in February.
*****
&gt; ""I don't think [the data] is as big an issue as it was when the Fed was actively talking about raising rates,"" said Massocca. 
""They said publicly they're not going to raise rates for the rest fo the year.""
*****
&gt; There are just a few Fed speakers, who will be of interest because of the change in market expectations for Fed interest rate policy. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks Thursday, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks both Wednesday and Friday.

# What Does A Big First Quarter Mean?

&gt; With a day to go, this is one of the best first quarters for the S&amp;P 500 Index ever. Of course, it comes on the heels of the worst fourth quarter since the financial crisis and the worst December since the Great Depression. Still, you have to be impressed with the overall bounce back after the big drop late last year.

&gt; “A big start to the year historically has suggested the bulls could remain in charge the rest of the year,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, 9 of the past 10 times the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 10% during the first quarter, the rest of the year was also in the green.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, continued gains the final three quarters of the year were quite normal after a big first quarter. It is worth noting, however, that extreme gains might not be in the cards, as the average return for the final three quarters of the year is 5.8%, which is actually lower than the average year’s final three quarters of 6.3%.

# April Almanac: DJIA’s Best Month

&gt; April marks the end of our “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&amp;P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the “Worst Six Months” have been lackluster on average. 

&gt; April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&amp;P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

&gt; The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.

&gt; Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&amp;P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April’s since 1979.

# First Trading Day of Q2: DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Higher 75% of the Time

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2517e648cdac3635e6063406fd1de2e/tumblr_inline_pp5990Be4E1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019, the first trading day of April is DJIA’s fifth best first trading day of all months based upon total points gained. Looking back at the last 25 years, in the tables below, we can see DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both advanced 75.0% of the time (up 18 of last 24) with average gains right around 0.4%. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have slightly weaker track records but are both still up more frequently then down. Last year, April’s first trading day was dealt a blow with losses exceeding 2% by S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000.

# Good News Indicators

&gt; The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers’ new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI expanded for the first time in five months, along the way tying the all-time high set September 2018. Additionally, it is up 3% year over year (YoY).

&gt; The combination of continued weak economic data around the globe and various parts of the yield curve inverting are leading many to surmise that a recession is likely imminent. The good news is that the LEI has not turned negative on a YoY basis, which it has done prior to every recession since the 1970s. And even when it has turned negative, it was another eight months on average before a recession officially occurred (with a median of six months lag time). For this reason, and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research’s Five Forecasters.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI remains well above the 0% YoY threshold, which would be a definite negative—on multiple levels.

# 11 Things You Need To Know About The Yield Curve

&gt; Well, it finally happened—the yield curve inverted. Now note that it was the shorter end of the curve that inverted, as the 3-month Treasury bill (and 1-year T-bill) now yields more than the 10-year Treasury for the first time since 2007. This matters because an inverted yield curve is the bond market’s way of saying there is a potential recession on the horizon. “The yield curve inversion is something that nearly everyone is talking about, given its perfect track record at predicting recessions,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “At the same time, however, we simply aren’t seeing other areas of the economy that would confirm a recession just yet, so there is more to this story.”

&gt; Please note that there is no one true “yield curve,” as the yield curve simply looks at the yields of a shorter-dated fixed income instrument and compares it to a longer-dated one. In fact, the more commonly discussed 2-year/10-year yield curve spread hasn’t inverted, and it is actually above the early December 2018 lows.

&gt; Here are 11 things worth considering regarding the yield curve.

&gt; * Each of the past 9 recessions back to the 1950s saw the 1-year/10-year yield curve spread invert approximately 14 months on average before a recession.
&gt; * Although a yield curve inversion preceded all 9 previous recessions, not all inversions led to a recession. For instance, the 3-month/10-year yield curve inverted in 1966 and 1998, with neither leading to an immediate recession.
&gt; * The shorter end of the yield curve has inverted, but the longer end is actually steepening. For instance, the 10-year/30-year yield curve has steepened most of this year. In past recessions, all parts of the curve inverted before a recession took place.
&gt; * Financial conditions aren’t tight, as tight conditions coupled with the yield curve inverting, historically has led to a recession. Investment-grade corporate and high yield spreads remain calm, however, suggesting that not all parts of the bond market are worried about an impending recession.
&gt; * Market participants have fully priced in a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut within the next year, potentially further flattening the curve. Should the economy gain steam during the second half of this year (which we think is possible) it will likely avoid a Fed rate cut, which should lead to a steeper yield curve.
&gt; * We have found that a spread between the 3-month/10-year yield curve has become much more predictive of a recession at -50 basis points (-0.50%). So this still is a clear concern, but a marginal inversion may not be so worrisome.
&gt; * Yield curves aren’t always perfect: Japan has had long stretches of inverted curves that didn’t lead to recessions. Additionally, both the United Kingdom and Germany have had inversions without recessions.
&gt; * The fed funds rate has been significantly higher during previous inversions. In fact, the fed funds rate has averaged more than 6% when the 1-year/10-year yield curve has inverted. It is only 2.4% currently.
&gt; * The previous 5 recessions began an average of 21 months after the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. Stocks actually did quite well initially after inversions as well, with the S&amp;P 500 Index not peaking until over a year after the inversions and gaining nearly 22% on average at the peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/7-16-18_Blog_table1_0319.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; * Various yields around the globe continue to sink, with nearly $10 trillion in global debt now yielding less than 0%. The German 10-year Bund, for instance, is beneath 0% for the first time since 2016. We think this is due more to a concern over the European slowdown, which has forced many to look to the United States as a safe haven for sovereign debt, thus pushing our yields much lower along the way. This concept is discussed in more depth in our latest episode of the LPL Market Signals podcast.
&gt; * As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 has actually outperformed the average year the previous three times the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. To reiterate though, the 2/10 spread hasn’t inverted yet.

# The Bespoke Report — Good, Bad, Or Ugly?

&gt; Stocks have basically held the line this week despite huge moves in interest rates and an ongoing rough run for global economic data. Curve inversion has many forecasting a recession, and we’ve seen a number of recent data releases that make us much more nervous about that outcome than we have been in almost a decade. On the other hand, the pivot to dovishness from global central banks, the relatively modest size and scale of yield curve inversion, some nascent signs of bottoming in global growth, and the nature of the plunge in interest rates are all reasons to not panic. Besides, despite all of the negativity US stocks have held up admirably well, and markets that trend higher on bad news are generally regarded as strong, rather than weak. In short, the outlook could be Good, Bad, or Ugly…depending how you read the tea leaves!

# A Strange Trip With Some Strange Leaders

&gt; With sentiment where it was at the end of last year following the Q4 rout in equities, it’s safe to say that not a lot of investors were expecting double-digit gains in the first quarter. That’s exactly what we have seen in US equities, though, as the major averages are all up over 10% YTD heading into the final hours of the quarter. While the Dow has lagged many of its peer indices this year, it too is still on pace to finish Q1 with a gain of just over 10%.

&gt; In the table below, we show how each of the 30 components in the DJIA have performed on a YTD basis as well as how much they have contributed to the index’s total gains. Remember, the DJIA is a price-weighted index, so the sole determinant of a stock’s weight in the index is its price. Looking at the table, you’re likely not the only one doing a double-take at the two stocks that top the list of best performers in the index so far this year. That’s right, Cisco (CSCO) and IBM have been the index’s two top performers in 2019 with gains of nearly 24%. Behind these two stocks, United Technologies (UTX) and Apple (AAPL) are the only two other stocks that are up 20% or more. To the downside, just five stocks in the DJIA are in the red on a YTD basis. Leading the way lower, Walgreens Boots (WBA), the newest stock in the index, has declined over 7%, but none of the four other stocks are down more than 3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032919-DJIA-Performance-1.png))**

&gt; Because the DJIA is price-weighted, the best-performing stocks in the index haven’t been the biggest contributors to the YTD gains. The chart below shows how many points each stock in the index has contributed to the YTD gains. Looking at things this way, you may be surprised to see that Boeing (BA) still tops the list. With its 17% YTD gain and very high share price, BA has contributed 374 points to the DJIA’s upside this year, beating out the next closest component (AAPL) by 160 points! All else being equal, BA could fall another 23 points (6.0%) and it would still be the largest contributor to the DJIA’s YTD gains.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

Understand simple things like, it returned 4.27% but even simple things like stock has a market cap of 13.9b with 290.9m outstanding, I'm not sure EXACTLY what that all means and if that is good or bad for an investor. Thank you guys :)


Liquidity:

The stock has a market cap of $13.9b with 290.9m shares outstanding, of which the float is 287.7m shares. Trading volume reached 4,426,420 shares compared to its average volume of 6,558,301 shares. Based on the current average volume and close price, the trading liquidity is good.
Historical Trading Performance:

Over the last five trading days, Western Digital Corporation shares returned 0.02% and in the past 30 trading days it returned 4.27%. Over three months, it changed 31.46%. In one year it has changed -47.44% and within that year its 52-week high was 95.70 and its 52-week low was 33.83. WDC stock is 41.56% above its 52 Week Low.

Our calculations show a 200 day moving average of 55.21 and a 50 day moving average of 46.19. Currently WDC stock is trading -13.27% below its 200 day moving average and may not be a good opportunity to buy as it may continue to trend down.

Earnings:

The last annual fiscal EPS for the company was reported at 2.12 that ended on 30th of June 2018, which according to the previous close, that is a PE of 22.59. Based on 5 analyst estimates, the consensus EPS for the next quarter is 3.20. The TTM EPS is 13.67, which comes to a TTM PE of 3.50. Historically, the PE high was 95.00 and the PE low was 3.50. WDC stock has set a new PE low record!

The following are the last four quarter reported earnings per share:
12-31-2018:  1.18
09-30-2018:  2.78
06-30-2018:  3.41
03-31-2018:  3.36

The dividend per share is currently 2.00, which is a dividend yield of 4.18%. Also, the payout ratio is 14.63%, therefore the dividend is safe according to our calculations. WDC stock has a high dividend yield, but because the company has sufficient earnings to cover future dividends, it may be a good investment opportunity for an income portfolio.

Base on our calculations, the intrinsic value per share is 88.63, which means it is possibly undervalued and has a margin of safety of 45.97%

## MY TOP 15 STOCK TRADER QUOTES

&gt;“The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you’re wrong.”**― William J. O’Neil**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed.”**― Peter Lynch**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Success in a free country is simple. Get a job, get an education, and learn to save and invest wisely. Anyone can do it. You can do it.”**― William J. O’Neil**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Always think of your entry point as last night’s close.”**― Paul Tudor Jones**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“The moral of the story is: never argue with the market. Your health and peace of mind are always more important than any stock.”**― William J. O’Neil**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“I went from mediocre to a stellar performer when I told myself: To heck with worrying about the money and obsessing over the scoreboard. I’m just going to focus on being the best trader I can be and sticking to the rules. Then the money followed.”**― Mark Minervini**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“I will keep cutting my position size down as I have losing trades. When I am trading poorly, I keep reducing my position size. That way, I will be trading my smallest position size when my trading is worst.”**― Paul Tudor Jones**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.”**― Warren Buffet**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Whatever gifts or ability someone might have been born with, success in the market comes from a concerted effort and a willingness to allow the learning curve to unfold, no matter how long it takes.”**― Mark Minervini**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Listening to the many market newsletter writers, technical analysts, or strategists who pour over 30 different technical or economic indicators and then tell you what they think the market should be doing is generally a waste of time.”**― William J. O’Neill**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“I set protective stops at the same time I enter a trade. I normally move these stops in to lock in a profit as the trend continues. Sometimes, I take profits when a market gets wild. This usually doesn’t get me out any better than waiting for my stops to close in, but it does cut down on the volatility of the portfolio, which helps calm my nerves. Losing a position is aggravating, whereas losing your nerve is devastating.”**― Ed Seykota**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“If you have timed the movement correctly, your first commitment will show you a profit at the start.”**― Jesse Livermore**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“I listened eagerly to what they had to say and religiously followed their tips. Whatever I was told to buy, I bought. It took me a long time to discover that this is one method that never works.”**― Nicolas Darvas**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“In the stock market, as with horse racing, money makes the mare go. Monetary conditions exert an enormous influence on stock prices.”**― Martin Zweig**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“You should always have a worst-case point. The only choice should be to get out quicker.”**― Richard Dennis**

&amp;#x200B;

As you can tell, the quotes by William J. O’Neill are my favorite as I have 4 out of the 15 quotes quoted by him. His books and strategy have influenced my trading strategy the greatest and I think his books are one of the greatest trading books of all time.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

Normally you would average down around a -5% drop. 

NIO is down -15% from where I first bought in and not following or caring about this space I was in no rush to average down on NIO.

I checked my brokerage account today and noticed two of my stocks were on **SALE**, so I bought more to average down.

* One of its competitors in China is looking to IPO soon. 
* Making it worse that competitor is backed by two Chinese tech heavy weights [Albaba and Foxconn](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/chinese-tesla-rival-xpeng-looks-for-fresh-funding-and-may-try-a-us-ipo.html). 
* NIO is(was?) backed by Tencent.

Criticism and scrutiny welcome and encouraged.

**The** **business**:

SMTA (SPIRIT MTA REIT) is an externally managed REIT formed in Maryland that invests in and manages a portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the U.S. that is generally leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to tenants operating within retail, office, and industrial property types.

Spirit MTA was spun off from Spirit Realty Capital for risk mitigation purposes for latter's real estate portfolio.

**Basic Info:**

Price: $6.87 as of previous close (3/26/19)

Market Cap: $295M

Current Yield: 19.4%

Beta: 0.59 (Nasdaq)

**Dividend** **history**:

Q3 18: $0.33

Q4 18: 1.33

Q1 19: 0.33

**Analysis:**

*The bad:*

SMTA has been absolutely hammered over the last six months, trading just below $12 in November to under $7 currently. Red flags for investors include SMTA carrying a negative book value of equity due to accumulating a deficit, despite slight increases in the debt structure in the company. The Company issued $150M in preferred equity in 2018. There is a legitimate concern that the company may go into liquidation. They have already written off a sizable portion of their debt.

This is key: As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was an allowance for loan losses on loans receivable of $35.1 million. $33.8 million of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2018 relate to an allowance on the B-1 Term Loan due from Shopko as a result of Shopko's bankruptcy. I am under the impression that this Shopko loss will be a one-off, but it is not the end of the road. From 2019-2023, Shopko owes SMTA $209M of $1,072M of operating leases (19.5% of total op leases over that period). SMTA has sold off a small amount of their owned properties portfolio, which has contributed to less revenue. Revenue over the past few hears has been stable, but not showing any signs of growth.

*The good:*

SMTA paid a special dividens of $1 on top of their regular dividend of $0.33 in Q4. Let's adjust this to assume a $0.33 dividend for for quarters for a $1.32 annual dividend. If the stock stays in the $7 range, this will yield 18.8%.

Even when being conservative and assuming no special dividends, and no growth. And lets assume also assume since this company is not a going concern, so lets make the cost of capital higher than what they are currently raising.

They issued Prefered shares paying 10% dividends, they have raised debt at effective rates of just below 6% interest.

**Assumptions**:

WACC. Using Duff and Phelps CAPM plus High Financial Risk Size Premium here. I would like some feedback on this part, if nothing else.

Rf = 3.5% normalized Rf rate

Beta= 0.54 SIC 6798 Median Beta

ERP= 5.5%

HFR Size Premium= 16.37%

Total KoE= 22.8%

Cost of raising further Preferred shares or debt will be more than in previous capital raises. I think using a weighted average of the cost of debt and preferred shares would inappropriately bring down the WACC.

Reminder that the Dividend Growth Model is P0= D1/(r-g)

Case 1:

Let's assume no growth in the dividend over the next year for a divided of $1.32 over our cost of equity of 22.8%. This gives us a price of $5.79, indicating it is overvalued by about 17%.

Case 2:

Let's assume small growth in the dividend over the next year, continuing with their special dividend giving us $2.32 annualized, but no further growth in the future with the same cost of equity. This would give us a price of $10.18, indicating about a 40% upside.

Case 3:

The company cuts dividends to $1 annualized, and indicates no future growth, with the same cost of equity. This would give us a prive of $4.39, a 37% downside.

**Conclusion:**

This stock seems to have a lot of question marks, especially with recent capital raises and high financial risk. If you are willing to speculate and are optimistic of the company's performance and a similar year. I am somewhere between all three of these cases, and from the relatively small time I've put into this analysis, I would not be surprised in either direction.

This is my first time posting a stock analysis on this sub. I would love your feedback.

It’s a lot for most people and not that much to others. But it’s definitely more than I’m usually comfortable investing in one single stock, that’s for sure. Go big or go home, I guess.  


When their groundbreaking drug, Orkambi, was awaiting approval, I told a friend I wanted to invest (I was only 25-26y/o at the time and would only be able to invest around $2,000). Since their degree was in the medical/bio field and they were also getting into investing, they said “Nah, ya gotta invest while study results come out. The stock price has seen its increase from Orkambi” in such an irritatingly confident way (in hindsight).  


About a week later Orkambi was approved and the stock shot up 30%. I still regret taking the advice. That was in 2015, I believe. The stock price was around $65. Today it closed at $188.90.  


According to the most recent press release on the trial ([Two Phase 3 Studies of the Triple Combination of VX-445, Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor Met Primary Endpoint of Improvement in Lung Function (ppFEV1) in People with Cystic Fibrosis](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/correcting-and-replacing-two-phase-3-studies-triple-combination)), **this drug increased lung function by 10% in people** ***already*** **taking Orkambi/Symdrko.** And as a user said r/CysticFibrosis, “**this is the single biggest thing to happen to CF treatment ever.**”  


From what I’ve read, I’m confident in the trial and not afraid I’ll lose money. My biggest concern is timing the market. I'm hoping the stock price won't see much of a decline before approval (There have been some drug price issues outside the US) and I don't think they'll submit for approval until the third or fourth quarter.  


Why am I so confident in the company? Vertex is basically a monopoly when it comes to CF treatment. Even after this new drug, they have promised more drugs are in the works.   
Vertex’s closest competitor (Proteostasis Therapeutics) just released their results of a study similar to VX-455 yesterday, and results were very disappointing. The stock loss was about -65.60% (bought some shares of that too while it’s at a low). From MY financial standpoint, that’s good news, but alas, for all CF patients everywhere, that sucks.  
But let me make this clear if it wasn’t before, Vertex has, not one, but TWO, trials in the third phase that are showing significant improvement in lung function. Whichever one performs better, they’ll submit for regulatory approval. So this puts them in a very good position to Outperform and dominate the market.

This is a very simple, easy to use strategy that allows you to see when breakouts or breakdowns are happening on a specific stock. With all the information you are going to receive in this post I am going to make it even easier for you. I am going to show you how the strategy works and how to use it as well as give you the studies to put on your ThinkorSwim charts, give you the scanners to scan for stocks that had a breakout or breakdown. Lets jump into it!

# How It Works

There are several ways to trade this strategy but first let's talk real quick about how it works. The way the opening range strategy works is it takes the highest price of a stock within the first 30 minutes of the day and the low of the first 30 minutes of the day and draws lines for both. So let's breakdown a quick example. Say TSLA opens the day at $275, then within the first 30 minutes it has a high of $278 and a low of $271 within that first 30 minutes of the market being open. This strategy will draw a line at $278 and a line at $271 on your chart. Then you can play the chart multiple ways off of those lines, lets take a look at the most common strategies.

The strategy will also create a grey box highlighting the first 30 minutes of the day. It will also draw a line at the ""midpoint"" or the middle of the opening range high and low.

# Opening Range Breakout

All the lines and data are already drawn out for you. You can also see the stock break above the red line, that would ideally be your entry for a long or call position. You can then see the stock has a nice run-up after the breakout. This is the most common way to play the ORB strategy.

# Opening Range Breakdown

The second most common is the Opening Range Breakdown, this is essentially the opposite of the breakout, you are watching for the stock to break the bottom ORB line and then you would enter a short or put position and as you can see the stock continues to dive lower.

# Opening Range Support/Resistance

The final way to play this is as an intraday Support/Resistance channel. AIG chart above is a good example of that. You can see how the stock just traded a little sideways right on that bottom ORB and then bounced up off of it. You can play this the reverse way as well if the stock trades sideways up at the top of the ORB.

**Important Tips:**

* When playing this strategy make sure you are utilizing the 5 minute chart.
* When using the breakout or breakdown strategy, **DO NOT** enter the trade until the 5 minute candle has closed above or below the top or bottom orb

# Scanners

There are still more goodies! I have also created and added a scanner that will scan for all the stocks that are above the top ORB as well as all the stocks that are below the bottom ORB. This is great because maybe you don't have a lot of stocks on your watchlist, well this will scan the whole market for stocks and pull all the ones that have a breakout or breakdown. The possibilities of finding a trade everyday are endless! This scanner always finds a bunch of stocks everyday for you to trade.

Let's get to all the studies so you can get this party started!

Looking at the history of $TVIX, it was very high at one point and has steadily fallen, with spikes here and there.  I know that this is typically used for day trading and is based on the volatility index.  From what I understand, you should typically not hold it overnight because there is some sort of ""reset"" which occurs each day.  Because of this reset, you will lose money if you hold it over time.

The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety and efficacy data for RI-002 submitted by ADMA in the BLA, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical studies be conducted prior to FDA approval of RI-002 for PIDD.

However, the CRL was issued because:

The FDA identified in the CRL certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at ADMA’s third-party contract manufacturers, including its contract drug substance and product manufacturer, its contract fill and finisher and compliance issues with a third-party contract testing laboratory, and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues.

In September of 2018 the FDA respected the manufacturer and with an improved status and gave a VAI status. Which in my understanding, means their were some issues, but not in the realm of consequence or action needed from the FDA.

Now ADMA RI-002 is set on April 2nd for FDA approval and I want to buy in. I am not very experienced in the stock market and want to know if receiving a VAI can issue another CRL for RI-002!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

UPDATE:

If you've been following my picks you will realize that the number of suggestions has decreased significantly, only 3 showing up today. This is because I have adjusted the decision engine that powers the system on the backend. I was doing an auditing of a random set of top picks for the past month and I noticed that on average these picks have grown about 0.3% every 3 days. This number is rather disappointing. When I investigated further I noticed that I have very good picks with 15%,6% growth in one week but I also have another set of very soft balls. This is the reason why I am adjusting the engine. Ideally, I would like to only see stocks that will have at least a 0.5% growth per day on average.

### US Stocks Preview Ahead of the Open

* **Global stocks are rising as Wall Street banks play down fears of a coming recession** in the wake of the US yield curve inversion last Friday
* **US stocks index futures are rising today,** with front-month Dow Jones minis +0.56%, S&amp;P 500 minis +0.51% and Nasdaq 100 minis +0.51%
* Goldman Sachs is telling clients, together with a number of other Wall Street banks, that **the inversion of the US yield curve seen on Friday, while usually an indication of a coming recession, is not reason to worry this time**
* The United States will announce March data for the **Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index** at 10:00 AM today. Economists expect a reading of 10.0, lower than 16.0 reported for the prior period.  
* The United States will announce **February Housing Starts** at 8:30 AM today. Economists expect 1,210k to be reported compared to 1,310k reported for the prior period.

True the TTM FCF is just break even but the company announced significant cost savings of $300m to be in place by July with a further $150m of potential savings identified.

That’s possible as the company pulls back and closes poorly performing value stores and focuses on fast growing premium and kids brands that already account for more than 50% of sales.

Then big news yesterday as the firm announced the sale of poorly performing (value) Maurices chain allowing further cost reductions and with net proceeds of $200m expected to be used to paydown debt (c.$1.3bn).

It’s a tough environment for retail but Ascena (ASNA) is doing the right thing by cutting costs, paying down debt and focusing on its strong performing premium and kids fashions.

If you're into blindly following predictions, skip to the very end for the list !

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 65 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the last major updates I have been working on backtesting and refining my strategy according to the results. Essentially what I settled on is running every stock on my list for 15 years in the past, predicting the price 10 days out, and comparing against the actual data. I then prioritize by the true positive rate over the false negative rate, times the average size of gains over the average size of loss. The top 25 stocks on my list following this strategy can be seen in the following table:

Note that I defined alpha here in an unconventional manner. A traditional alpha (relative to market performance) would be alpha/glf. Essentially this boils down to if you follow this strategy, your gains to losses will be alpha\*G/l. If you left your money in the market all the time your gain to loss ratio would be glf\*G/l.

So with that in mind, here are the same stocks ordered by glf\*G/l:

The major take away from this: alpha is typically higher than the number of gain to loss days, meaning that we have beat the market on average by following this strategy (a traditional alpha here would be 1.56/1.31=1.19, or 19% better than leaving our money in all the time in the same stocks). I think this is decent, but obviously can be improved. I'd be glad to hear what your ideas and criticism!

I've wanted to get into the stock market since the 7th grade. But until recently I had forgotten about it. So after I couldn't get to sleep I decided to start looking into the stock market. I watched a couple videos on YouTube and looked at some stock market app reveiws. None of the apps seemed trust worthy from the reviews and the videos I watched tended to recommend these apps. So I thought I'd get a bigger community's opinion on how to start and whether I should trust these apps anyway.

Citron research has been bearish on it for years. A recent article by WY Capital, Wayfair: Plenty Of Reasons To Sell, reiterates why W is overvalued and bound for a correction. The problem is, they have been generally wrong, or at least the timing, as W stock price continuously climbs higher.    

I'm on the bearish side as well, but would like to know any counter arguments or why it's not a good time to short it yet.    

Disclosure: I have a minor short position on W, and am thinking of adding more.    

The bear case:  
- The furniture/home goods business is cut-throat, and W doesn't have a moat. Amazon, Walmart, and IKEA are among its larger competitors, against whom W has no real advantage.  
- There's no clear path to profitability. If W's business model were ever to be profitable, it should've been profitable by now. Yet, it has been losing money for 5 straight years.  
- W relies heavily on online advertising to gain customers. The customer acquisition cost has been steadily rising, eating into its already-thin margin.  
- W is highly leveraged, and its stockholder equities is negative. If you own the stock, you literally own nothing but hopes and dreams.    
- W has been investing heavily in Europe and Canada, which is a risky move considering the real estate market cool down in Canada and the overall economic slow down in Europe.  
- W stocks are constantly being diluted due to management awards, and management has been selling their stake non-stop.  
- With a bleak economic outlook, overvalued stocks like W would be under the most selling pressure.  

The bull case:  
- W could POTENTIALLY become the next Amazon.

Boeing faced an unthinkable defection in the spring of 2011. American Airlines, an exclusive Boeing customer for more than a decade, was ready to place an order for hundreds of new, fuel-efficient jets from the world’s other major aircraft manufacturer, Airbus.

The chief executive of American called Boeing’s leader, W. James McNerney Jr., to say a deal was close. If Boeing wanted the business, it would need to move aggressively, the airline executive, Gerard Arpey, told Mr. McNerney.

To win over American, Boeing ditched the idea of developing a new passenger plane, which would take a decade. Instead, it decided to update its workhorse 737, promising the plane would be done in six years.

I hope all is well.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a beginner in the stock market, still studying, reading, researching and trying to find out an acceptable and practical approach.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have an inquiry regarding funds and adviser websites (like IBD and Stock Locator).

&amp;#x200B;

When someone like Warren Buffet says that he advises people to invest in Vanguard, why don't they do it (especially when you track their records, over a long time, you find out that they give you good returns) and why websites don't recommend investing with Vanguard, or, at least, make it not that attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue is IBD's Leaderboard. After reading his book (William O'Neil), I read a lot about his website, but I didn't find it encouraging. The strange thing is that a website (Stock Locator) claims that his returns are around 90% in 2018!! (too good to be true). If it is really true, why don't everybody just subscribe with him and get rich?

&amp;#x200B;

I need your opinion and insights on those issues.

In the short term, post reverse split, this seems like a no brainer.  I haven't fully examined the situation, but considering the market cap in the secondary market compared to net assets, it doesn't seem necessary to do so.  Even if you subtract goodwill (which can't be worthless, must be worth something) you get a net asset value of $345,279,000.   I haven't fully researched the whole story yet though, but for those who have, would be great to hear your thoughts.

# **Dow drops more than 450 points, S&amp;P 500 posts worst day since January amid global growth worries  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/stock-market-wall-street-in-focus-as-growth-concerns-persist.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled on Friday as global growth fears and the Federal Reserve's more cautious economic forecast sparked investor angst into the weekend.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank to its session lows heading into the close and finished down 460.19 points at 25,502.32. Bank stocks led the decline thanks to a sharp pullback in long-term Treasury yields. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.9 percent to 2,800.71, its biggest one-day drop since Jan. 3. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.5 percent to 7,642.67 as shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet and Apple all closed lower.
*****
&gt; ""There's a host of worries out there and those worries continue to mount,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ""The fear of recession is increasing.""
*****
&gt; ""As a result, we have a market that is rethinking some of the optimism that was priced in.""
*****
&gt; Sending bank stocks lower was an inversion of the so-called yield curve. The spread between the 3-month Treasury bill yield and the 10-year note rate turned negative for the first time since 2007, thus inverting the curve. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term rates surpass their longer-term counterparts, putting a damper bank lending profits. An inverted curve is also considered a recession indicator.
*****
&gt; Citigroup fell more than 4 percent. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America all declined at least 2.9 percent.
*****
&gt; Friday's moves come after Fed surprised investors by adopting a sharp dovish stance on Wednesday, projecting no further interest rate hikes this year and ending its balance sheet roll-off. Though investors often dislike higher borrowing costs and rate hikes, the motivation for the central bank's restraint rekindled worries of a GDP growth slowdown. The Fed justified its more temperate outlook by cutting its U.S. economic growth outlook for 2019.
*****
&gt; ""Maybe one should think about the global economy and not pin everything on the Fed,"" Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of Doubleline Capital, told CNBC's Scott Wapner. ""Except the Fed should operate in consideration of global conditions too.""
*****
&gt; Friday saw more weak economic data from around the world that stoked those fears.
*****
&gt; IHS Markit said manufacturing activity in Germany dropped to its lowest level in more than six years in March. In France, manufacturing and services slowed down to their lowest levels in three months and two months, respectively. For the euro zone as a whole, manufacturing fell to its lowest level since April 2013. These data sent the German 10-year bund yield briefly into negative territory, its lowest level since 2016.
*****
&gt; ""The indicators are stacking up to suggest that this is not a 2021 phenomenon, that we could actually see the possibility of a recession starting maybe later this year,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""
*****
&gt; Nike also weighed on the market throughout Friday's session. The athletic apparel company's stock fell 6.6 percent on the back of weak quarterly sales growth in North America. Boeing shares dropped 2.8 percent after Indonesian airline Garuda canceled a $6 billion order for 49 Boeing 737 Max jets.
*****
&gt; Despite the decline on Friday, stocks were still up sharply for the year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are up 11.7 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, has rallied 9.2 percent.
*****
&gt; ""Let's not lose sight of the fact that we've had a nice rally over the last couple of weeks,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Today is not a great day, but after a strong week or two you tend to get a bit of a sell-off.""
*****
&gt; ""Now, should you be cautious? Absolutely, because the slowdown worldwide is something people need to be cautious about.""

# Watch Out For End of March/Q1 Weakness

&gt; March markets have been rather turbulent in recent years with weakness historically later in the month, taking some mean end-of-quarter hits as fund managers often partake in quarterly window dressing and portfolio restructuring. After the big gains we logged in January and February choppy market action is not surprising, especially with the backdrop of the ongoing China trade and Brexit deal delays and what appears to be the end of the Fed tightening cycle for now. Boeing’s woes and U.S. political infighting have not helped either.

&gt; But as you can see in the chart of the recent history of typical March trading patterns with 2019 performance overlaid in dotted lines, action so far this month has not been all that unusual. With that in mind we are ever leery of another end-of-March hit.

# April Almanac: DJIA’s Best Month

&gt; April marks the end of our “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&amp;P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the “Worst Six Months” have been lackluster on average. 

&gt; April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&amp;P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

&gt; The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.

&gt; Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&amp;P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April’s since 1979.

# Russell Falls Apart

&gt; While the rest of the market was rallying and holding up, the Russell has been struggling for close to a month now. After peaking above its 50-DMA back on 2/25, the Russell has had a hard time holding onto any gains lately. Earlier this week it made a lower high when the rest of the market was making higher highs, and to close out the week, it declined 3.6% for its worst day of 2019, making a lower low. Not a pretty chart at all.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Ruh-Roh.png))**

&gt; The Russell’s underperformance can really be seen in the ratio of the Nasdaq to the Russell 2000. This week, the ratio between the two really become unglued, topping 5 for the first time since February 2001.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Ratio-20-years.png))**

&gt; On a longer-term basis, the only time the Nasdaq has been outperforming the Russell 2000 by such a wide margin was during the period from November 1998 through February 2001. And if you think the ratio is extreme now, during that period it got as high as 8.64 on March 28, 2000. In order for the ratio to get to that sort of extreme now, the Nasdaq would need to top 13,000 (assuming the Russell remained at the same level).

# Yield Curve, Yield Curve, Yield Curve

&gt; If you are anything else besides the yield curve today, the market doesn’t care. After inverting for the first time since 2007 earlier today, the spread between the yields on the 10-year and 3-month US Treasuries has sucked up all the oxygen in the room as investors, traders, and their algos fret over the ominous economic signal that an inverted yield curve historically implies. Who cares whether the onset of a recession usually comes several months or even a couple of years after the curve first inverts; investors are using this as an excuse to take profits, and take profits is what they’re doing.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-YCa.png))**

&gt; Just to illustrate how captivating the yield curve has been to the equity market, check out an intraday chart of S&amp;P 500 futures versus the yield curve since very early this morning. Moves in the yield curve are clearly leading equities. When the curve started flattening early this morning, equities started heading south with the pace of selling accelerating when the curve inverted. Then, as the curve made its intraday low right after noon, the low in equities followed less than 40 minutes later. It’s like the school playground, where the yield curve is the ‘cool kid’ and equities are the followers.

# Stocks Feeling Sensitive

&gt; Investors are wondering what the right number is for the market as stocks leg lower on bad global data to close the week. Without taking a view on what the “right” price for the S&amp;P 500 is, below we show a way to organize thinking about valuation in the short-term. In the table below we show a range of EPS growth rates relative to 2018 and a range of multiples on the resulting EPS numbers. The result is where the S&amp;P 500 should trade given hypothetical earnings and how those are valued. For example, if you estimate EPS will fall 2% in both 2019 and 2020, and you value those EPS at a multiple of 15.0x, the S&amp;P 500 is almost 700 points above where it should be! Alternatively, if you think EPS will be stable but should be valued at a relatively aggressive 19.0x, the S&amp;P 500 should be trading near 3100. In the grid below, we’ve highlighted ~2800 values (roughly where the S&amp;P 500 sits right now) to show the implicit EPS growth and multiple assumptions embedded in the price. Again, we don’t know the “right” combination of multiples and EPS growth, but if you’re extremely beared up with the Friday drop or think stocks are set to surge thanks to a dovish Fed, this analysis can help you see what sort of assumptions would need to play out for that to happen.

# The Fed on Reserve

&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed) has doubled down on its patient stance. Policymakers signaled a complete pause in policy at the conclusion of the Fed’s March meeting, with a nod to a slowing pace of growth and global uncertainty.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Fed voting members projected (via the latest “dot plot”) unchanged to slightly lower interest rates this year, with one more rate hike in 2020 or later to lift the long-term rate to 2.75%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DOT-Plot-Aligns-with-a-Federal-Reserve-U-Turn.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Policymakers also lowered their gross domestic product growth projections to 2.1% for 2019 and 1.9% for 2020, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that global weakness could be a notable headwind to the U.S. economy.

&gt; Still, Powell conveyed significant faith in U.S. economic fundamentals, noting in his press conference that “it’s a great time to be patient,” as the labor market remains strong, confidence has improved back to encouraging levels, and the outlook remains positive.

&gt; “Powell and the Fed delivered a balanced message to U.S. investors, indicating that the lack of clarity warrants a patient stance,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We side with the Fed here in thinking that underlying economic conditions remain solid, with evidence of a slowdown at the beginning of this year from near-term temporary headwinds.”

&gt; Powell hinted that interest rates are in the “broad range” of neutral, or the point where policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive to output. That doesn’t mean that rates have hit a short-term ceiling, though. We wouldn’t be surprised if stabilizing U.S. growth and higher inflation lead to a rate hike in the second half of 2019. The Fed’s current projections give few indications of that happening, likely because of policymakers’ hesitance to pass judgment on the U.S. economy amid mixed signals from data. Because of this, we expect the Fed to carefully communicate any change in stance to investors.

&gt; The Fed also announced it would start reducing the pace of its balance-sheet runoff in May, and end the runoff entirely in September. Powell reiterated that interest rate changes are the Fed’s primary policy tool, but a larger balance sheet could help buoy risk assets and capital investments.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

Completion of the transaction, by way of a distribution of a dividend in kind to Novartis shareholders and ADR (American Depositary Receipt) holders, is expected to be on April 9, 2019. In the distribution, each Novartis shareholder will receive 1 Alcon share for every 5 Novartis shares/ADRs they hold on April 8, 2019, close of business, a notice issued to London Stock Exchange said.

Approval has been given, subject to customary conditions, by the SIX Exchange Regulation for the listing of the shares of Alcon Inc. on the Swiss Exchange (SIX) pursuant to the International Reporting Standard. Authorization has also been received for the listing of shares in Alcon Inc. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Shares in Alcon Inc. are expected to be listed and traded from April 9, 2019 on the SIX and the NYSE under the ticker symbol “ALC”. Alcon will also be included in both the Swiss Market Index (SMI®) and Swiss Performance Index (SPI®) from the first day of trading, as recently announced by the SIX.

Alcon has secured debt financing of USD 3.5 billion through a group of banks. The Alcon credit rating will be investment grade following the spin-off. Moody’s Investor Service and S&amp;P Global Ratings have rated Alcon at Baa2 and BBB, respectively, with a stable outlook. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS AG are advising Novartis on the transaction.

Shares of Novartis will continue to trade on the SIX under the symbol “NOVN”. Novartis ADRs will continue to trade “regular-way” on NYSE under the symbol “NVS”.

According to the notification, as opposed to a typical US domestic spin-off, and in order to align trading between the Swiss and US markets, there will be no “ex-distribution” trading of Novartis ADRs, nor “when-issued” trading of Alcon shares, prior to the spin-off. Shareholders will not have the ability to trade Novartis ADRs ex-dividend on the NYSE during the period between the day before the ADR record date and the spin-off completion date and will not have the ability to trade Alcon on a “when-issued basis” on either the SIX or the NYSE prior to the spin-off.

Beginning on April 9, 2019, shareholders will be able to trade Alcon shares in the regular-way market on both the SIX and NYSE under the symbol “ALC”.

These companies have made Timothy Springer into a multi-millionaire, but they haven't had much movement lately and I'm not sure if they will in the future. A lot of these ""high flying"" biotech stocks have an IPO with a lot of fanfare, then it's a slow burn as they have trouble gaining a foothold in the marketplace or get beat by competitor medical products.

I read/watch a lot of stuff that Tim Springer puts out, he's definitely a smart guy and has obviously made smart investments for himself. But that doesn't necessarily translate to profits for people who get in way down the line.

I've never heard of this stock before, but I am familiar with QVC and HSN although I didn't know people still shop their haha

&amp;#x200B;

I seen that QRTEA was oversold and figured I'd take a shot at it. I'm not going long unless this trade goes bad and I'm forced to average down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm only looking to make a 5% gain on this and then I'm rolling that into the next oversold stock. I have my sell limit order at $17.83.

Due to these losses, Lyft may need to borrow or raise more equity after its first year on the public market, which means debt or dilutive stock offerings.

Lyft’s sales, on the other hand, appear positive on the surface with incredible growth year-over-year from $343M in 2016 to $1.05 billion in 2017 and 100%+ growth in 2018 at $2.15 billion. The problem is that the losses are also accelerating.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

JPMorgan, Harlan Sur  
 

There was a “strong focus on profitability” amid a weak  
 first half of the year. Expects fundamentals to trough in the  
 August quarter and improve into 2020.  
 Raises price target to $64 from $55 and affirms overweight  
 rating.  
 

Goldman Sachs, Mark Delaney  
 

“While we are somewhat more positive in aggregate as a  
 result of the incremental supply side response from Micron, we  
 continue to see several fundamental risks for the near to  
 intermediate term,” including a potential increase in inventory  
 and seasonal pricing issues.  
 Affirms neutral rating. Lowers earnings expectations for  
 2019 through 2021, but raises price target to $42 from $38.  
 

Baird, Tristan Gerra  
 

There was a “much sharper” decline in gross margins than  
 expected, and while this takes Micron “closer, faster to a near-  
 term trough,” it expects steady gross-margin declines throughout  
 2020.  
 Affirms underperform rating and $32 price target “as we  
 expect the DRAM environment to deteriorate further next year.”  
 

Citi, Christopher Danely  
 

The results were “bad” and the guidance was “dismal.”  
 While the outlook and production cut were “appropriate  
 steps,” the “DRAM crash” will keep the stock estimates under  
 pressure. Downgrades to sell and cuts price target to a Street-  
 low $30 from $35.  
 

Barclays, Blayne Curtis  
 

The cut in production “admits a weakening market,” but it  
 “also indicates a more rational supply approach in this  
 environment and eliminates some variable cost.”  
 Affirms overweight rating and $40 price target.  
 “Clearly we are not at a bottom yet but demand trends are  
 expected to improve in the 2H, inventory should be worked  
 through midyear, and MU is taking a rational approach to  
 managing these challenging times.”  
 

KeyBanc Capital Markets, Weston Twigg  
 

“MU is managing through this soft period well and long-term  
 drivers should become significant tailwinds in F2020 and  
 beyond.”  
 Lowers estimates “to reflect near-term softness,” but “we  
 fully expect a rebound to occur entering 2020.” Recommends  
 adding to positions now, and raises price target to $49 from  
 $45. Affirms overweight rating.  
 

Morgan Stanley, Joseph Moore  
 

“Micron is executing well in a tough environment,” but  
 seasonality won’t be enough for supply/demand issues to clear.  
 Sees enough value to remain equal weight on the stock, but  
 is “cynical” about a recovery in the second half of the year.  
 Price target $32 from $33.  
 

What Bloomberg Intelligence says  
 

“Weak pricing and demand trends may extend into 3Q, and if  
 they last into calendar 2H19, the elevated inventory may be sold  
 at lower prices amid production cuts, impacting projected 3Q19  
 and 2020 sales and margins.”

 By Ryan Vlastelica  
 (Bloomberg) -- Micron Technology Inc. rose in early trading  
 after the semiconductor company reported second-quarter results  
 that beat expectations. But it also gave a forward outlook that  
 fell below forecasts and said it would cut both production and  
 capital spending in response to weak demand for its DRAM memory  
 chips.  
 Analysts were largely positive on the plan, calling it  
 necessary in a difficult environment, and saying it could set  
 the stage for a rebound in the second half of 2019. While a few  
 firms remained cautious about Micron’s prospects -- with Citi  
 downgrading the stock and Morgan Stanley saying it was “cynical”  
 about the prospect of a rebound -- several firms raised their  
 price targets.  
 Shares gained 3.7 percent before the Thursday market open.  
 As of Wednesday’s close, Micron is down more than 35 percent  
 from a May peak, though it has jumped nearly 40 percent off a  
 December low.

Backtesting example: DIA predicting 3 days into the future, 67% accuracy, size of moves within 12%: [https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F](https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F)

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 3 days into the future (previously 10) in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Source code can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

The new bond will be of benchmark size – which generally means upwards of USD 500 million. “A USD benchmark Reg S offering under its Euro Medium Term Note Programme may follow subject to market conditions,” a notification issued to Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) noted.

QNB is an active debt issuer and has widened its funding sources over the past two years, partly because of Qatar’s regional dispute, opting for private placements in different currencies.

Qatar National Bank (QNB) is the largest lender by assets in the Middle East and Africa. The planned bond issue would be QNB’s first public dollar bond transaction in more than two years and its first since a political dispute erupted in 2017 between Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.

It may be mentioned here that Qatari banks were considering issuing U.S. dollar bonds, hoping to take advantage of an easing in global volatility.

It doesn't come up very often but typically when it does it creates a great day trading opportunity and sometimes even a nice overnight hold. It's based off the 15minute chart using the Money Flow Index (MFI).

First, I use MFI religiously. My trading style compliments overbought/oversold stocks. I noticed that with the 15 minute chart on SPY anytime the MFI has a reading BELOW 20(which is oversold territory) there is a reversal. Sometimes the reversal is quick and a fast $1.50-$2.00 movement occurs. Other times the movement is a bit slow and the run up is only about a $1.00. However, I've noticed that EVERY time this set-up occurs the reversal happens. It's wild. I ran this strategy back to September and couldn't find a time where it failed. Even through the bearish months.

Today at the end of the trading day SPY dropped quite a bit and the MFI fell hard and right when it got to a reading of about 8-10 it reversed back up.

I encourage anyone to go backtest it.

But nothing I google explains what happens when, as many do, you buy shares over a course of time? Seems like a common situation not to be explained by our pals at Investopedia.  


First question: Let's say I bought 50 shares of a stock, then six months later I buy 100 more. If a year passes from the original purchase, I sell it all. Do I pay long-term on the 50 that I owned for a year, and then short-term on the 100 that I did not own for a year? Or does it only matter that I've owned any amount of that stock for at least a year? 

Second question: when is it actually a profit? Let's say my total cost basis for those 150 shares is $12,000. The stock is currently selling at $100. If I sell all of it, I'd make $15,000 and thus come out ahead $3000. Instead, I sell 50 shares for $5000, Have I realized capital gains for purposes of taxation?

Would picking one of these Target date funds be recommended? Expense ratio seems rather high.

Backtesting example: S&amp;P500 past 15 years, 64% accuracy: [https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK](https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK)

Update: I've tested several periods for predicting into the future, and found that changing from 10 days to 3 days significantly improved the size of the predicted moves to within 10%. Predictions will now be given three days in advance.

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 3 days into the future (previously 10) in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

There are things that can be achieved through effort, and some can’t be controlled by that. 

In investing, only by reading good books and articles we can experience the change of investing philosophy. 

However, we can’t change our investing psychology. The old wisdom “Don’t be emotional” is something we can’t act upon easily. 

Oftentimes we find that our emotion is out of our control range. Therefore it doesn’t really seem reasonable to think of directly controlling our emotion in investing. 

The only way to solving it is to set up a right system of behavior, instead of directly trying to change your mind whenever it hit you like it’s a mind control game. 

The idea “Don’t be focused on the daily fluctuation” can’t be achieved only through mind control, but through detailed action plan like “investing only small amount so as not to be itchy to check it every second” or “just check the stock price once a day”

Better yet, we can employ a tactic of “lowering a bar” in which we just check the price 3 times a day at a specified time. 

What I am trying to say is based on different ideas than the famous idea “set up principles and stick to it”. Rather, it is about how we should deal with principles when we fail to act upon them.

Those ideas above are actually subset of principles and it has a little different nuance compared to just principles. It has reflected daily contradictory behaviors and human error when having to follow principles and adjusted principle so that it can be executed in different ways.

Backtesting example: S&amp;P500 past 15 years, 64% accuracy: [https://imgur.com/a/Y9ola9Z](https://imgur.com/a/Y9ola9Z)

Update: I've done quite a bit of work backtesting this script, and now have a visualization of how well this is doing to share with you. I ran my model on the S&amp;P 500 for the past 15 years with the same strategy that I use now. I saved the predictions for each 10 day period, and the actual stock price, and show these in the top plot of this image. The blue shows the predictions and the black shows the actual price. To check the amount of time that the two lines are going in the same direction, and also their overall rate of change, I took the discrete derivative and plot this on the bottom. When the two are going in the same direction, the background is green (and red when the predicted direction fails). It looks to be working about 64% of the time. It also allows you to see just how badly it is off: this typically follows a huge jump (see near day 170, 210, etc.) Once the derivatives get shaken up in other words, it starts to perform worse (as expected). 

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Source code can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

They try to get a similar amount of money on each side so they can take their 5-10% cut of the losing bets and give the rest to the winners. If they have too much action on one side, they risk of losing money. 

They aren’t really even concerned with offering the proper odds. For example, when a big market team with lots of stars and good ESPN coverage plays a team of unknowns from a poor city, the sports book has to offer very good odds so smart money will bet the other side to help mitigate the risk.

I have a strong suspicion that when too much casual money still ends up on one side is when the most otherwise unexplainable officiating happens.

You can search on your own why this is easy to do for small money, but hard to make serious profit off of. I’d forgotten about this but was thinking about how to replicate this in the stock market. 

I think in the stock market, the equivalent to the sports book would be to know who really is too big to fail next time. Which may be a matter of knowing who has spent the most on lobbying lately.

I’m already a contrarian investor, but all this got me thinking again about how to identify and position myself to be on the side of the “smartest” money when the otherwise unexplainable financial officiating happens.

### US Stock Market Preview Ahead of the Open

* **US stocks index futures are climbing this morning,** even after the S&amp;P 500 closed at a 5-year high with front-month Dow Jones minis +0.41%, S&amp;P 500 minis +0.41% and Nasdaq 100 minis +0.40% 
* The **US Federal Reserve (the Fed) is set to release its decision on interest rates tomorrow** after the conclusion of the 2-day FOMC meetings. 
* The United States is set to announce final **January durable goods orders growth** at 10:00 AM. Analysts expect growth of +0.4%, in line with December’s durable goods orders growth of +0.4%. 
* The United States will also announce **factory orders growth in January** at 10:00 AM today. Analysts expect growth of +0.1% while December saw higher factor orders growth of +0.3%.   
* Oppenheimer technical analysis strategists argue that **the current rally in low volatility stocks is positive for the US stock market in general**.  While the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility index is up +17% since the S&amp;P500 hit its lows on December 24th, it has underperformed the broader S&amp;P 500.  The divergence in performance suggests that while low volatility stocks have performed well, it is simply a function of broader re-rating of the S&amp;P 500. 
* A **weaker US Dollar will be needed to help boost the S&amp;P 500 further** according to Bloomberg.  Unless the Greenback weakens in the second half of CY2019, we may not see a strong recovery in tech and materials stocks earnings – the two sectors who saw the largest EPS declines in 1H.  
* After another “no vote” on her BREXIT Plan in the UK Parliament, **UK Prime Minister Theresa May is looking for another extension to the deadline** for the UK exit of the European Union (EU). 
* The VIX is little changed this morning and is currently at 13.1 after closing at 13.1 yesterday

* The US Treasury 2s-10s Spread has widened 0.06 basis points to 0.15%

* Current global crude **oil prices will need a further rally in the US stock market and sustained production cuts from OPEC** according to analysis by Bloomberg.  While Saudi Arabia has recently cut production targets, The Kingdom continues to produce 1mm bbls/day above CY2014 production levels.  This would suggest the current production cuts only address last year’s excess capacity and do not properly confront the impact of decelerating global growth on oil demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking to see if we can start an all out discussion on $FB.  Analysis, structure, cash flow, as an investment, future growth, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

My superficial view of it:  

The Bad: $FB is a company plagued by stupid mistakes. Yes, lots of people have grown to hate it due to #PrivacyGate which has started to affect Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc. but most of the issues, by far, have been on Facebook's end.  A lot of its users have started to lose confidence in the company BUT I do believe the companies, especially Facebook, are starting to get it with this whole privacy thing.  You'll notice that there are more prompts, visible information, opt out buttons, disclaimers that aren't buried in fine print, etc. than there was before when using most products from Google, Apple, and Facebook that wasn't there before.  Zuckerberg doesn't seem to want to guide a purely for profit company, which is good and bad for different audiences.  As investors, we like to see companies relentlessly pursuing higher levels of profit, guidance, etc. 

The Good: They have a large user base that is ""hooked"" on them, with lots of new area to capitalize on in other countries.  Their business model in my opinion (which is by no means professional) is solid - they have a great cash flow, very little cost compared to other companies that we love to invest in.  Very good profit margin.  A sizable cash hoard.  They have countless ways to monetize the information they have via ads (Which they're already doing, of course, but there's more for them to do.).   Though there are people claiming ""FB is dead"" and ""nobody uses it anymore"" etc. the numbers tell a different story.

&amp;#x200B;

For lack of a better term, I've been ""bag holding"" a bunch of FB @ $165.85 for a while now.  Before the big 20%+ hit, I was feeling great.  Now it's FINALLY started to recover and some more bad news came out causing it to dip to $160.  What is your outlook on it?  

&amp;#x200B;

Does FB make up a part of your portfolio?  Long term?  Short term?  What do you expect the price to do?  What options does FB have to continue growth?   

&amp;#x200B;

I know lots like to just spew the ""FB is trash!"" line, but really, the numbers tell a different tale.  Don't let personal distaste attempt to influence reality.

Most notably DTRO and DTNF membranes. They have been growing non stop since they were founded in in 2012. The first 6 months of 2018 they did $25 million in revenue(up 267% or $7.20 million from six months ending 2017), $7.24 million in net income and $0.67 in EPS. They currently trade at $7.33, at a valuation of $80 million.

The reason I think they can keep growing is that China has some of the most polluted rivers in the world and the country recently made a new law requiring companies to prevent water pollution.

Their technology has been promoted by the government.

The numbers of employees have grown at a steady rate since inception, they had over 180 on May, 2018. And almost 300 in January this year. I think this is a indication of a growing demand for their products and services. 

The reason for the explosive employee growth in 2018 is that they finished and moved into their new 185,000 square foot manufacturing, R&amp;D and office facility. They are in phase II on the project and are constructing a 106,000 square foot facility which are going to hold a lab and a plant for membrane materials. It's expected to be completed in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the risks: While the management team has a lot of experience within the water treatment industry, they didn't have any experience in running public companies before they IPOed Newater. 

Another risk is that it's a China based company with all of their revenues coming from China, I think many people will turn away once they hear this, for good reasons. I personally trust the management team but some companies based in China have often managed to hide information from the SEC and the public through their auditors. 

I am looking for higher returns so I am willing to take the political risk if you want to call it that. But the management team have to prove them self over the next quarters/years, but they've done a great job since 2012. 

Another risk is that share price drops can happen very fast, in midst of the trade war it dropped from $30 to $10 with no explanation other than it possible was the trade war. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion there is great potential for the company if they even grow half as good as they currently do in the future. But I think there is a lot of political risk that one has to accept, but I am personally  willing to take that since I see great potential for the company going forward. So what do you think about the company. I would appreciate opinions both good and bad beyond the ones I have stated.

So, I was considering buying shares from a certain company - I don't intend to make a lot of money from it, I literally just want to try it to get a bit of an insight, see first hand how stocks affect the share. If I never make any money from it I'm still perfectly happy. 

All I want to ensure is that I don't lose more money than I invest.

So from what I understand, if the stock price is $20, I'd have to pay a little more than that (similar to currency exchange where the rates are a bit different) and if I'd sell it immediately, I probably wouldn't very the full $20 back, but probably around... 18? 

So yes, I'm ok with losing the $20 (or whatever price I buy the share for), but I wouldn't want to pay any more than that. 

What do I need to keep on mind? Does it depend on the type of company (Inc in that case) whether or not I will be held responsible if their stocks drop?

Thanks for everyone’s wonderful feedback so far and to the r/stocks moderators for their excellent support! This post reflects Friday's moves, and I am posting today (Sunday) in preparation for the upcoming trading week.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play.  My script runs a loop from 50 (previously 200) to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy. 

&amp;#x200B;

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.  
 

Thanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements since my last post:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I cleaned up my source code for public consumption, which can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)
2. Most importantly, backtesting! This has been a frequently asked question, and is without doubt an important undertaking. While more rigorous backtesting is always warranted, here’s what I have done so far: Taking SPY, DIA, and NDAQ as test cases, I ran a loop over the script (included as backtest.pro on github) and tested the predictions against the actual data. I examined mainly the directional accuracy (whether the price goes up or down), and used these to tune several of the parameters: namely how many derivatives to include in the projections, which max/min SMA periods to include, and how to optimally weight the outputs from different SMAs.   
   
 Going back 1000 days and predicting 10 days into the future, this script was \*on average\* 61% correct at predicting the direction of change for SPY, DIA, and NDAQ. I think this is pretty decent, though of course far from perfect. Other sets of parameters that I tested typically yielded between 50-55% accuracy. For comparison, see this ([https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a](https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a)) machine learning approach that generated excitement from the financial crowd with 54% accuracy.   
 
3. I am now including a relative strength index (RSI) column in the table to help identify when a stock is overbought/oversold. A typical strategy is to consider RSI&gt;70 to be overbought, and RSI&lt;30 to be oversold. I try to maintain a portfolio of stocks between those values, although it’s possible for an RSI to remain over 70 (or below 30) for a significant period of time. 
4. To make matters easier for mobile users, you’ll find the top 10 and bottom 10 tickers on my list in the main body of the post, and the full list of stocks that I’m tracking in the comments (including your suggested stocks, so keep them coming!)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Cheers!

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

For those that don't know, this ratio can mark market risk with inflation added: a ratio between 10-20 is healthy, over 20 is considered a market of risk and growth, over 25 a market of high risk and low growth. Basing my opinion on Benjamin Graham's conservative methods. as of today the market is at high risk, which I think that the market can offer the stocks at a lower price in the long term. 

If you compare from May to September 2001, the market went in decline with two stops at 32.17 and 27.67 respectively, then on January 2002 it spiked to 30.1, until the economy kept going down up until March 2003 where the market had lows at aprox. 21.31. 

  
Now if you jump to 2018, the market had similar ratios of years 2001, and as of today I see that the market has been growing consistently in relation to the spike at early Q4 of 2018 (market then went down on december), but, I have this feeling that the market is showing signals that it wants lower ratio, similar to the ones of 2003. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, my opinion is that we can find better stock prices **IF** the market goes lower, which in fact I see that it can go lower. As Jones Dow suggest that the market will always discount the stock prices; Graham also says that in the long term markets will always go down.

# **Week Ahead: Fed to make important forecasts as stocks on 'precipice' of breaking out  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/fed-to-make-forecasts-as-stocks-on-precipice-of-breaking-out.html)**
*****
&gt; The Fed's meeting is the big deal for markets in the coming week, and it is widely expected to send a message that investors in both bonds and stocks could find bullish.
*****
&gt; But analysts in both markets say the Fed's message has been well telegraphed, and market response could be tepid or even a ""sell the news"" reaction.
*****
&gt; The key for both markets will be what the economic data shows, after a series of weak reports. Thursday's regional Philadelphia Fed survey and PMI data Friday on manufacturing and the services sectors will be important. Existing home sales are also released Thursday.
*****
&gt; ""The first quarter has not exactly been a hallelujah quarter, and the Fed has to acknowledge that,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, but it is also expected to issue a new forecast with fewer rate hikes and a slower economy. The Fed also is likely to announce the end of its operation to unwind its balance sheet, but economists are divided on which month this year it will actually end the program.
*****
&gt; Stocks surged in the past week with the best performance since November for the S&amp;P 500, which ended up 2.9 percent. At the same time Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to fall. The bench mark 10-year Treasury slipped below 2.60 percent Friday, its lowest yield since June 4, and the 2-year was at 2.43 percent.
*****
&gt; The fact that both markets are rising at the same time is somewhat unusual, and at some point the trend could break in favor of one market versus the other.
*****
&gt; An easier Federal Reserve, meaning one less inclined to drive up rates, is viewed as a positive for stocks because higher interest rates can slow the economy and send borrowing costs higher for companies and investors. Bond yields also head lower when the Fed is not likely to raise interest rates.
*****
&gt; ""This could be an interesting week,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. He said it should be positive for stocks if the Fed reduces its forecast for rate hikes and delivers on expectations.
*****
&gt; ""This is the meeting where we get more clarity on the balance sheet reduction. Both those things would be an affirmation of where things are right now. It's also technical…where we close [on the S&amp;P] puts us on a precipice of breaking out,"" said Hogan.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,822, near the key 2,825 level which is the upper end of a big band of resistance. ""The only down week of the year was the week before this, and the trend has been higher,"" he said.
*****
&gt; But Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute chief international investment strategist, said the stock market could actually have little reaction to the Fed because Fed officials have been very dovish in public comments.
*****
&gt; ""It could be neutral or perhaps even negative. What more can they say? You might see some people selling the fact,"" he said. Christopher said he sees the market as stretched, and it could sell off. But then, there could be a buying opportunity.
*****
&gt; ""We think stocks have to start to feel better about the economy first,"" he said, adding a trade deal with China could be a positive.
*****
&gt; The Fed's actions could also already be priced into the bond market, according to George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. He said what really matters is what risk markets, or stocks, do in response.
*****
&gt; ""There's scope for risk to do better and the Fed's not hiking. You can see it rally into the summer and the economy will look better and if that happens that will be a buying opportunity for rates,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Economists see the Fed reducing its forecast for two rate hikes to one or even none for this year. They also expect it to say it will end its program to reduce the balance sheet, but they don't agree on whether that happens in June, September or closer to the end of the year.
*****
&gt; The Fed is currently reducing its balance sheet by allowing securities to roll down as they mature, instead of replacing all of them as it previously did. It now theoretically could allow $60 billion a month to roll off, but Fed officials could change that program and begin to repurchase securities to replace them.
*****
&gt; The markets are also waiting to hear if the Fed will focus solely on Treasury securities, and at what part of the curve – or duration. In the past it had purchased mortgages but is expected to discontinue that.
*****
&gt; ""We think they're back to buying Treasurys by Oct. 1. Somethings got to give. At some point, its either that [bond market] people are too pessimistic and the economy is going to do well because the Fed is behind the curve, or we have another kind of correction on our hands in the next six to nine months,"" he said. ""We just have to pass through time There's a powerful faith-based system around easy money can fix all things.""
*****
&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to continue to forecast one rate hike for this year. The Fed interest rate forecasts appear as anonymous dots from individual Fed officials on a chart, known as the ""dot plot.""
*****
&gt; Even so, she doesn't expect the Fed will actually raise rates but it will continue to give itself flexibility. Economic data has been mixed with some very poor reports, like December's retail sales, which fell 1.6 percent, and February's jobs report, which showed job growth of just 20,000 jobs, 160,000 below forecast.
*****
&gt; ""I think they have to walk a fine line between acknowledging the weakness we've seen and then also show that we're still going to see growth this year,"" she said.

# Irish Eyes Shine on Market Last 25 Years, but Monday After Sunday St. Patrick’s Day Weaker

&gt; Saint Patrick’s Day is the only cultural event that perennially lands in March. Over the years gains the day before Saint Patrick’s Day have proved to be slightly better than the day itself and the day after. Perhaps it’s the anticipation of the patron saint’s holiday that boosts the market and the distraction from the parade down Fifth Avenue that causes equity markets to languish. Perhaps it’s the all the green folks don that stirs up thoughts of money and market gains. More likely, it’s the fact that Saint Pat’s typically falls in historically bullish Triple-Witching Week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c625182aa350a6356847eb0e14d70a58/tumblr_inline_poey5afw611spdppr_1280.jpg))**

&gt; Whatever the case, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 0.19% on Saint Patrick’s Day (or the next trading day when it falls on a weekend), a gain of 0.13% the day after and the day before averages a 0.24% advance. S&amp;P 500 median values are 0.17% on the day before, 0.20% on Saint Patrick’s Day and 0.07% on the day after.

&gt; In the nine years when St. Patrick’s Day falls on a Sunday like this year, since 1950, Friday advanced an average 0.15% and the following Monday suffered an average loss of -0.08%. However, over the last 25 years market performance on Saint Patrick’s Day and the day after has improved, up 72% of the time on the Holiday with an average gain of 0.57%.

# The Bespoke Report – Break Out the Monocle

&gt; Below is an updated look at our ETF Asset Class Performance Matrix, which shows the total returns of key ETFs across assets classes on both a YTD, MTD basis as well as over the last week. How strong were global equity markets this week? Well of all the equity-related ETFs in the matrix, not a single one finished the week in the red. Even Industrials (XLI), which were dragged down by Boeing (BA), managed to eke out a gain of 0.2%. Among US indices, the Nasdaq 100 blew away the field rallying over 4%, but every other US index ETF was up over 1.4%. International markets were even stronger with India (PIN), Brazil (EWZ), and China (ASHR) all rallying more than 4%. Rounding out the four names from BRIC, Russia (RSX) even rallied 3.5%. In terms of YTD leaders, China and Crude oil are neck and neck for the top spot with gains of 25%+.

# The Most Loved Stocks in the S&amp;P 500

&gt; Earlier this week we provided a full update on analyst sentiment across sectors and individual stocks in our Closer report. Below are a few charts and tables that we’ve pulled from the big report in case you’re interested.

&gt; As shown below, there are 22 analyst ratings per stock in the S&amp;P 500 on average. But Energy and Communication Services have more than 29 ratings per stock! It’s hard to find an edge with nearly 30 analysts covering a name.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ratingsper.png))**

&gt; Notably, the Energy sector also has the highest percentage of analyst Buy ratings, which is surprising given that Energy has been the weakest sector of the market since the S&amp;P peaked last September. It looks like analysts think the sell-off for Energy has caused valuations to become more attractive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/buyratings.png))**

&gt; Below is a table listing the S&amp;P 500 stocks with the highest percentage of Buy ratings right now. There are 3 stocks in the index that have 100% Buy ratings — Marathon Petroleum (MPC), ABIOMED (ABMD), and Keysight Tech (KEYS). Both MPC and ABMD are basically flat this year, but KEYS is up 39% YTD. Even after the gains, though, analysts still love KEYS.

&gt; Other notables on the list of most loved stocks include mega-caps like Amazon.com (AMZN) with 93.9% Buy ratings, Alphabet (GOOGL) with 93.2% Buy ratings, and Microsoft (MSFT) with 91.9% Buy ratings. Diamondback Energy (FANG) is the most loved Energy sector stock, while AMETEK (AME) is the most loved Industrials stock.

# S&amp;P 500 Sector Trailing 12-Month P/E Ratios

&gt; The S&amp;P 500’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio got down into the low 15s at the bottom in late December, but we’ve seen huge P/E expansion as the market has rallied back. As of this afternoon, the S&amp;P’s trailing 12-month P/E sits at 18.61. Even still, that’s well below readings in the 20s that were seen for a number of weeks in 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spxpe0315.png))**

&gt; Below we show one-year P/E ratio charts for major S&amp;P 500 sectors. Since the December lows, we’ve seen P/E expansion in every sector, but the one that stands out the most is Utilities.

&gt; We went into detail on extended valuations for the Utilities sector in yesterday’s Chart of the Day for members, but you can see the spike up to 19.80 in the one-year chart for Utilities below. At 19.80, only Technology, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary have higher trailing 12-month P/E ratios than Utilities right now.

# Pre-Election-Year March Historically Stronger

&gt; As of today’s close, this pre-election year March is below average when compared to it historical performance. Strong market performance in pre-presidential-election year frequently translates into above average performance for individual months. March is a month that typically enjoys a nice boost, but so far it has not occurred. Prior to the gains of today and yesterday, this March was well off its average levels. This March and past pre-election year average performance has been plotted in the chart above and the gap in performance is readily visible.

&gt; Strong gains in January and February had major indexes right at key resistance levels at the start of the month and when they failed to break out profit taking ensued. Slowing global growth, naming in China and the EU along with ongoing trade concerns and last Friday’s tepid jobs report have all weighed on stocks. Heavy selling of DJIA’s largest component, Boeing (BA) has kept that index in check this week. Despite sign of slowing growth, the US economy is still on relatively firm ground when compared to other regions. Further market gains are likely, but progress is probably going to be choppy.

# What Type of Pullback Could We See?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index corrected nearly 20% from the September peak until December 24 before staging a furious rally of 19%. What could happen next? A well-deserved pullback would be perfectly normal, and in fact, is probably needed before another surge higher can occur. Now the $64,000 question: Would a pullback be a retest of the December lows, a 10% correction, or something more modest?

&gt; As we discussed in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Modest Pullback Or Something Bigger? we think a pullback in the range of 3–5% is the most likely scenario. “We continue to see solid fundamentals, valuations that are quite reasonable, the strong possibility of a U.S.-China trade deal over the coming months, and healthy market technicals,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. In fact, six technical indicators we mentioned in the recent commentary suggest a pullback could offer buying opportunities for suitable investors:

&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is above its upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA), suggesting an improving trend, and at support in the form of its 200-day moving average.
&gt; * March has been the second strongest month for the stock market over the past 20 years.
&gt; * Stocks tend to go up in the final 10 months of a year (25 out of the last 27 years) after experiencing gains during January and February.
&gt; * Market breadth is favorable, with a high proportion of stocks participating in this year’s advance.
&gt; * Investor flows have been negative in 2019—evidence of caution, not euphoria
&gt; * Investor sentiment surveys suggest bulls are not in overabundance.

&gt; Last, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, it’s important to remember that the S&amp;P 500 has been higher a year after every midterm election since World War II—that’s 18 out of the past 18 midterms—with an average return of 14.2%. President Trump views the stock market as part of his re-election path, suggesting this pattern could hold once again. With the S&amp;P 500 up only 1.3% since the midterm election last November, there indeed could still be room for stocks to run in 2019.

By Lisa Ray 

As the market continues to pick up steam and reassert the big bad bull in manifest form, investors are left with the task of splicing the market into useful opportunities. One group that hasn’t received sufficient focus is the conglomerates. Today, we look at three stocks in the group with strong potential for investor gains: 3M Co (NYSE:MMM, Innovest Global Inc (OTCMKTS:IVST), and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX). 

3M Co (NYSE:MMM) trumpets itself as a technology company worldwide. The company’s Industrial segment offers tapes, abrasives, adhesives, ceramics, sealants, specialty materials, purification products, closure systems, acoustic systems products, automotive components, abrasion-resistant films, and paint finishing and detailing products.

Its Safety and Graphics segment provides personal protection and transportation safety products, commercial graphics systems, commercial cleaning and protection products, floor matting, roofing granules, fall protection products, self-contained breathing apparatus systems, and gas and flame detection instruments.

The company’s Health Care segment offers medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, drug delivery and health information systems, dental and orthodontic products, and food safety products. Its Electronics and Energy segment provides optical films, packaging and interconnection devices, insulating and splicing solutions, touch screens and monitors, renewable energy component solutions, and infrastructure protection products.

The company’s Consumer segment offers consumer and office tapes and adhesives, repositionable notes, indexing systems, home improvement products, furnace filters, painter tapes, mounting and home care products, sponges, scouring pads, high-performance clothes, protective material products, and adhesive bandages and braces. It also provides cloud-based, conversational artificial intelligence-powered systems.

It serves automotive, electronics and automotive electrification, appliance, paper and printing, packaging, food and beverage, construction, medical clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, health information systems, food manufacturing and testing, consumer and office retail, office business to business, home improvement, drug and pharmacy retail, and other markets.

MMM hasn’t really done much of anything over the past week, with shares logging no net movement over that period.

3M Co (NYSE:MMM) generated sales of $7.9B, according to information released in the company’s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of -2.5% on the top line. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($3.3B against $7.2B, respectively).

Innovest Global Inc (OTCMKTS:IVST) casts itself as a diversified holding company that focuses on identifying and acquisition of qualified mineral prospects.

This is a diversified holding company with operations in commercial and industrial products and services, energy, biotechnology, and health services. Innovest Global utilizes novel technology and marketing to efficiently acquire customers.

The company’s primary growth strategy is to acquire existing companies in a select few industries, and attract new customers in cost effective ways. Currently, it has a Commercial &amp; Industrial Division, and a Biotechnology &amp; Health Services Division.
The company recently took a strong stake in StemVax Therapeutics, a Translational Biotechnology Company that develops novel therapies for brain tumor patients. The company focuses its efforts on developing immunotherapeutic approaches to treating patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), a devastating brain cancer.

The company also focuses its research efforts on novel drug development to target Cancer Stem cells and other multi-resistant cancer cells. It seeks to “make a difference in patient’s lives. Bringing new beginnings to the market by developing novel therapeutics. Dr. Dwain Morris-Irvin, President of Innovest’s Biotech division is the StemVax founder and Chief Science Officer.”

In addition, the company just announced that it has signed a letter of intent on March 4, 2019 to purchase 100% of a building materials supply company. According to the release, the central Ohio target generated $4.2 million in revenue with income of $300,000 in owner benefit in 2018, and is currently a purchasing member of Authority National Supply (ANS), an Innovest Global Company.

The company was formerly known as Aurum Resource and Asset Management, Inc. and changed its name to Innovest Global, Inc. in January 2017. Innovest Global, Inc. was incorporated in 1999 and is based in Las Vegas, Nevada.

If you’re long this stock, then you’re liking how the stock has responded of late. IVST shares have been moving higher over the past week overall, pushing about 28% to the upside on above average trading volume.

Innovest Global Inc (OTCMKTS:IVST) generated sales of $1.1M, according to information released in the company’s most recent quarterly financial report. In addition, the company is holding cash levels at $390K.

United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) bills itself as a company that provides technology products and services to building systems and aerospace industries worldwide.

Its Otis segment designs, manufactures, sells, and installs passenger and freight elevators, escalators, and moving walkways; and offers modernization products to upgrade elevators and escalators, as well as maintenance and repair services. The company’s Carrier segment provides heating, ventilating, air conditioning, refrigeration, fire, security, and building automation products, solutions, and services for commercial, government, infrastructure, residential, and refrigeration and transportation applications.

This segment also offers building services, including audit, design, installation, system integration, repair, maintenance, and monitoring. Its Pratt &amp; Whitney segment supplies aircraft engines for commercial, military, business jet, and general aviation markets; and provides aftermarket maintenance, repair, and overhaul, as well as fleet management services.
The company’s Collins Aerospace Systems segment provides electric power generation, power management, and distribution systems; air data and aircraft sensing systems; engine control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems; engine components; environmental control systems; fire and ice detection, and protection systems; propeller systems; engine nacelle systems; aircraft lighting, seating, and cargo systems; actuation and landing systems; space products and subsystems; avionics systems; flight controls, communications, navigation, oxygen, and training systems; food and beverage preparation, and storage and galley systems; and lavatory and wastewater management systems. The company offers its services through manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, wholesalers, dealers, retail outlets, and sales representatives, as well as directly to customers.

It will be interesting to see if the stock can break out of its recent sideways action. Over the past week, the stock is net flat, and looking for something new to spark things. UTX shares have been relatively flat over the past month of action, with very little net movement during that period.

United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) managed to rope in revenues totaling $18.1B in overall sales during the company’s most recently reported quarterly financial data — a figure that represents a rate of top line growth of 15.3%, as compared to year-ago data in comparable terms. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($6.2B against $31.4B, respectively).

Hi team, 

I am following up on my previous post back 29 days ago. Since then the stock is up 35% and big catalysts coming up.

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/apwh8o/mrs_mission_ready_solutions_starts_trading_feb/


**What has changed since the previous post?**

1)  MRS completed Unifire Inc acquisition on February 14th and was conditionally approved by the TSX to start trading pending submission of business plans documents for Unifire Inc. They're still working on this to get the full approval.

2) Unifire received $4 billion contract split 6 ways among the 6 licensed companies.
**Unifire Receives TLS Contract Extensions**
On March 7, 2019, Unifire was awarded a bridge contract (the “SOE Bridge Contract”) with the Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) to extend its current Tailored Logistics Services (“TLS”) Special Operations Equipment (“SOE”) contract for an additional year with the new expiration date being March 6, 2020. The SOE Bridge Contract – carrying a maximum dollar value of USD$4 billion – was awarded to the six incumbent TLS SOE contract holders, including Unifire, and will continue coverage of the full line of SOE and incidental services under the DLA Troop Support SOE TLS program. Additional information on the SOE Bridge Contract can be viewed at the following link:

https://dod.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract-View/Article/1779133/

3)  MRS is doing a private placement at 0.25 which is rumoured to be oversubscribed. The private placement is wrapping up shortly possibly within the next 5 business days.

****What are the next catalysts?****
We do not know how much of the $4 billion for the next 365 days Unifire received. I think thats confident information but we will know once the acquisition if fully complete and audited financial statements are sent to shareholders.

We still have yet to see the awards for the DLA contracts which total up to $33 billion for the next 10 years. That's the catalyst.
