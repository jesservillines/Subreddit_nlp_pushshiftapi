Oppenheimer gives Outlooks Therapeutics $12.00 price target(...wtf)

[https://imgur.com/Vt4DyJB](https://imgur.com/Vt4DyJB)

Oppenheimer commits to buying 26 400 000 shares and warrants from Outlook.

[https://imgur.com/fvfjnEU](https://imgur.com/fvfjnEU) 424b4 April.10th.

[https://imgur.com/zon2Qwh](https://imgur.com/zon2Qwh) Chart. Price fell to under $1.00 after this offering. The price per share in the offering was $2.75. Before this recent uptick on May.15, the price was still under $1.00. Underwritten in ""bought deal"".

[https://imgur.com/J8FunXu](https://imgur.com/J8FunXu) Outlook receives 26 million

You can see here [https://imgur.com/yCXHV0f](https://imgur.com/yCXHV0f) that the deal closed with Outlook receiving $26.2 million from the underwriters on April.12.

Are we really to trust Oppenheimer? They were down more then 50% at the time of that buy rating. If it moved from $1.00 to $12.00, that would be a 1200% increase! Charlie Munger is famous for saying, ‚Äúshow me the incentive, and I‚Äôll show you the outcome‚Äù, and with the warrants exercisable at $2.90, this could make a good short term trade, but $12.00? Absolutely not!! Think about it, lets say the price did in fact go to $12.00, Oppenheimer would theoretically be making $160 160 000! They would obviously exercise the warrants well before then because their job is to underwrite the offering, not invest, but it still puts into perspective how ridiculous this buy rating is. Just look at their most recent quarterly report. They only had $100 000 in cash!!???!! WTF!!! How many more offerings will they do between the run up to $12?!!

[https://imgur.com/a/JGL8U1v](https://imgur.com/a/JGL8U1v)

Current market cap is \~650m.  There peers are CGC, APHA, TLRY, etc.  The exception is that they are one of the rare profitable companies in this sector.  They've been a grower of produce (tomatoes, cucumber, etc.) for the last 30yrs operating on razor thin margins and have already established relationships with big box retailers like walmart, wholefoods, krogers, etc.  With the recent nationwide legalization of cannabis in Canada and Hemp in the US, they've pivoted.  They own a 5msqft greenhouse in Canada and is in a Joint Venture (50% )with Emerald Health Therapeutics under a company called Pure Sun Farms (psf).  They're currently cultivating 1.1M sqft (D3) this year and will be converting another 1.1M sqft (D2) to be completed Q2 next year (yet another 2.7m sqft is waiting in the wings -- D1).   In the states, they have a JV (65%) with Natures Crisp based in GA and are currently cultivating 800acres of Hemp. They have access to another 5000acres as part of this agreement. Planting is expected to be completed by Mid June and a rolling harvest will commence about 1-2mo later. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2 major catalysts for this week.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Last Friday, They were just granted a processing license by Health Care Canada.  This enables them to sell their cannabis directly to the provinces.  Up until now, they've been strictly wholesale.

2) Texas is on the verge (this week) to legalizing Hemp.  VFF owns a 5.7m sqft greenhouse in Hemp and will move to quickly convert their operations to the much more lucrative business of Hemp and CBD.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe they are massively undervalued compared to their peers and are poised to run aggressively this year and beyond.  Have a look and come and chat with us in r/weedstocks and [stocktwits.com](https://stocktwits.com)

I stumbled across a few old stock certificates from ~2005, and they are they old Pixar certificates with the Pixar characters and the infamous Steve Jobs signature back when he was chairman. I have 2 certificates each for 2 shares. 

I did a bit of research and it seems like the certificates themselves are selling pretty well online, but I have no clue how to go about this process or if that is the best move to make.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/ULgahQd](https://imgur.com/gallery/ULgahQd) (Trump pumps Workhorse on twitter)

As some of you may remember, the President announced that Workhorse was in talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown complex. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that this is, in my opinion(opinion), impossible, and I‚Äôll show you why.

WKHS is in the middle of a Death Spiral Financing agreement with Arosa Capital Management and Marathon Asset Management. Arosa is owned by Till Bechtolsheimer , grandson of [Karl-Heinz Kipp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Heinz_Kipp), the founder of the Massa [department store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store) chain. [His sisters wedding was attended by the likes of Prince Harry, Prince William, and numerous other prominent royals.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9904867/Duke-and-Duchess-celebrate-friends-wedding-in-Swiss-Alps.html) 

[https://imgur.com/MhCJJ1A](https://imgur.com/MhCJJ1A)

At first, it wasn‚Äôt readily apparent who Till Bechtolsheimer was. When he participated in the GP of Monaco racing event, there was an article written about him that pretended he was [some mystery man.](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2017/03/16/cjwrs-renaissance-man-till-bechtolsheimer-reflects-on-first-ctsc-year/) 

[https://imgur.com/2FJKH5C](https://imgur.com/2FJKH5C)

   
 

It wasn‚Äôt hard to find out who he was because in 2014, his girlfriend (I‚Äôm guessing ex girlfriend now) was party to an altercation where it is claimed she[ smashed a beer bottle over the back of a mans head](https://web.archive.org/web/20190509010704/https:/www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/family-defend-friend-of-duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge-accused-of-beer-bottle-attack-in-club-9138649.html) for daring to bump into her royal boyfriend at a nightclub.

Okay, so now that we know who our mystery man is, lets move on to the real story. There was roughly 20 million warrant shares registered in S-3‚Äôs recently acquired pursuant to a loan agreement with Arosa and Marathon last year. Before Trump issued that Royal Pump on twitter, WKHS was trading under $1.00, and risked being delisted by the Nasdaq. Seems very convenient doesn‚Äôt it? 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/vwxbY4j](https://imgur.com/vwxbY4j) 3/27/19, S-3 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9](https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9) S-3 12/26/18 

   
 

Marathon owns about 10 million warrants, and Arosa 8 million. The exercise price of the warrants has been adjusted down a few times, and as of now they currently sit at $1.25, down from $2.00. The circumstances surrounding how Arosa received these warrants is most unusual‚Ä¶ 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/IS93T8g](https://imgur.com/IS93T8g) 

   
 

Huh?‚Ä¶.So Arosa loans the company money, then 4 months later they get paid back with a new loan from a completely different lender, but they get to keep the 5 million warrants? That‚Äôs one hell of a deal don't you think? 

   
 

Workhorse also recently sold a large asset to Duke Energy, which at the time was being used as collateral in the Arosa loan agreement. Personally, and this is completely my opinion, this transaction reminds me of what they refer to as a [‚Äúbust out‚Äù ](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/24/bain-capital-tony-soprano_n_1542249.html). Many of you remember how Mitt Romney affiliated Bain Capital would lend to struggling companies under aggressive terms, [loot the company of the their assets, then fire everybody](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-183291/). Activity like this is not uncommon in death spiral financing arrangements. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for the borrower to secure financing, but due to desperation, they will agree to whatever terms are available with the hope that things might turn around. This isn‚Äôt the kind of behavior you‚Äôd expect from a company in legitimate talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown Complex, a 6.2 million square foot facility (getting to that soon). 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/U49I51k](https://imgur.com/U49I51k) 

   
 

One of the covenants of the Arosa loan is that Workhorse is to sell [Surefly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2018/10/23/meet-surefly-a-hybrid-electric-helicopter-that-looks-like-a-drone/), one of their most important assets. They manufacturer an interesting Multicopter prototype, something that, with the right leadership, has true potential. 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/LFngngO](https://imgur.com/LFngngO)

   
 

They also accrued a warranty liability of 6.9 million in 2018 for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of money to put aside, and a colossal fuck up considering the timing. They are barely scraping by. 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF](https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF)

   
 

Just one look at their operations makes it pretty clear that the dilution is not even close to being over. Yes, that‚Äôs a quarterly..

They even tell you they don‚Äôt have enough money to make it through to the second half of THIS year, not next year‚Ä¶THIS year! Seriously?! And Trump pumped this thing????!!! This is insanity! He is supposed to be the president of the United States, supposedly the greatest military strength in world history, the Commander-In-Chief, and he is pumping this POS.....

   
 

[https://imgur.com/9JMFGMX](https://imgur.com/9JMFGMX)

   
 

Also, they admit that the financing from Arosa and Marathon is explicitly for further inventory purchases. No mention of capital expenditure.

Net sales went down 93%????‚Ä¶..Okay, lets take a step back here. 2017 sales were 10 million, and in 2018 sales were $700k? The expenses are almost the same for both years though. If you do the math, 2018 expenses were 3000% of net sales!!! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶WTF??!! The question we have to ask ourselves now is HOW DO THEY EXPECT TO BUY A 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT 902 ACRE PRODUCTION FACILITY WHEN THEY HAVE VIRTUALLY NO SALES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING UP TO THEIR PANTS IN DEBT TO EUROPEAN NOBILITY!!!!! THIS IS AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE, OR AS TRUMP LIKES SAYING, ‚ÄúA DISGRACE‚Äù!!!!!! 

   
 

Last, but not least, their competitors are massive corporations with 100‚Äôs of years of combined experience..I could keep going on, but I think you get the point by now. The company is facing bankruptcy, had virtually no sales last year, and the covenants in the loan agreement require them to sell one of their most important assets. They put aside 7 million for a warranty liability for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù, while selling another few million in batteries to Duke Energy. [Also, the founder recently left, someone who had been with the company for almost a decade! ](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/05/1711059/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Promotes-President-and-Chief-Operating-Officer-Duane-Hughes-to-Chief-Executive-Officer.html)

Boeing's response to the two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes was marked by delayed apologies and confusing messages, according to experts, analysts, and lawyers who talked to Business Insider.

This likely deepened mistrust in Boeing rather than winning it back as the company is aiming to do, they said.

Boeing seemed to defend the plane's safety at the same time as apologizing for the crashes and promising to update the plane.

Dear Investors,

I am a second year student of finance and accounting. I kindly ask you to fill in a short, pleasant insightful questionnaire concerning emotions and cognitive errors, which we deal with in investment processes. The survey is an important part of my project concerning behavioural aspects of the decision-making process.   
 I apologise for any mistakes in language ‚Äì I‚Äôm not an English native speaker.

The survey is fully anonymous and contains 19 simple questions and a metric.  
 The questionnaire takes a few minutes to complete.

With last weeks ER (beat by a penny), any fears were stemmed as CSCO didnt suffer any spending cuts and to the contrary was so unfazed by any tariff issues (the company was expecting Trump to go through the tariffs and prepared for the worst).
In response, CSCO jumped 7 %, which is quite a lot for CSCO (it isnt a FANG stock and usually moves like 1 to 1.5 % at best).

With that being said, CSCO is *almost* to its recent high.
From what i can tell, CSCO has very little exposure in China (3 % from what i gathered) and i think is bound to profit A LOT from the ban of Huawei in the US  (which might or might not spread to the UK and EU, its undecided yet)
Also, unlike QCOM and AAPL, CSCO is apparently not depending on sourcing from China.

So, barring any larger market downturn, i feel like CSCO is in an AMAZING spot right now, event though it had a very strong runup since 2017/2018.

Sorry, I realize this is reddit and not TradingView help, but I'm a new free user on their site and my lack of ""reputation"" prevents me from posting comments/questions ANYWHERE.

&amp;#x200B;

Their ""Ideas"" section is great, but I'm having trouble filtering for ideas I would like to see.  TV provides the option to see ideas by categories like ""Asset Class"", ""Chart Patterns"", ""Technical Indicators"", etc.  However, I can't find a way to filter by a combination.  For example, I'd like to see various ""chart patterns"" of ""US stocks"" (asset class), but I can only either see ALL US stock ideas or ALL chart patterns (which is dominated by \[asset class I'm not allowed to post about\]).  Does anyone know if there's a way to do this?  I can see they have tags for each of these ideas but no obvious way to sort them.

ARRY 17% cost basis $21.34
I like their drug pipeline and I think they have lots of potential.

ATRS 9% cost basis $2.81
I like how their Xyosted product has been performing and think there is potential there.

CGC 7% cost basis $45.48
I believe they will become a leader in marijuana, especially if USA legalizes someday.

CWBHF 13% cost basis $21.98
I am down quite a bit on this, however I like that they are a leader in the CBD space and CBD appears to be the current craze now.  Who knows how long that would last.

DIS 22% cost basis $135.85
I probably bought way too high but I like how their films have been doing recently.  Also I look forward to disney+ and ESPN might pick up some steam with sports gambling becoming popular.  I also like the dividend.

GILD 11% cost basis $64.70
This is a stock I see rebounding when there newer drugs start ramping up sales.  Hopefully they develop a FDA approved drug for NASH as that is a projected multi billion market.  I like their dividend too.

GTBIF 10% cost basis $19.21
I probably bought at the wrong time, however with more states legalizing and marijuana sales increasing I think GTBIF will do fine.  They are one of the biggest USA marijuana plays out there.

T 11% cost basis $31.28

I think the bash and trash crowd will be gunning for these stocks in the weeks and months ahead. Don't be the guy selling NFLX at 150 IMO. Be the guy selling today when everything was hunky dorry and at extremely high valuations.

# **Fed speakers could steal focus from trade war in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/fed-speakers-could-steal-focus-from-trade-war-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; A flurry of Fed speakers and any new trade developments could shake up what normally might be a slow week of trading ahead of the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.
*****
&gt; Stocks ended the past week with losses, as trade-related headlines caused big swings in the market. The Dow ended the week with a 0.7% loss to 25,764 in its fourth negative week. The S&amp;P 500 fell for a second week, losing 0.8% to 2,859. The Nasdaq lost even more, 1.2% for the week, after U.S. action against China‚Äôs Huawei depressed U.S. tech names that do business in China.
*****
&gt; Friday ended with losses in the final hour, after CNBC‚Äôs Kayla Tausche reported that talks between the U.S. and China appear to have stalled, and there have been no discussions on scheduling a new round.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWith the trade stuff, this is brass knuckles time. When you institute tariffs...when you go to 25% like we just did, all of a sudden there‚Äôs no room for error,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. ‚ÄúThe stakes are so much greater at 25%, and if we did the other $300 billion dollars, then we start damaging the consumer and you can guarantee a global recession.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The U.S. raised tariffs last week from 10% to 25% on $200 billion in goods, and China responded by raising tariffs on $60 billion in goods.
*****
&gt; Boockvar, like others, had been looking for a trade deal earlier in the month, but there has been no sign of positive movements, and the crackdown on Huawei raised concerns about China retaliating against U.S. companies.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúChina is not bending and with Trump taunting them, they‚Äôre pissed. It still remains the case that everyone wants a deal , It‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interest. It‚Äôs tough to negotiate when you get hit in the head with a baseball bat,‚Äù said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks Monday night at the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs annual conference on Amelia Island, Fla. and there are about a dozen Fed speakers appearing at various conferences and events. There are also minutes Wednesday afternoon from the last Fed meeting, where Powell re-emphasized that the Fed was on hold and it did not see low inflation as a big enough reason to cut rates.
*****
&gt; The market this week began pricing in more than one Fed rate cut for this year, as traders in fed funds futures reacted to some weaker economic data.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhatever message the Fed feels like it needs to get across, they‚Äôll use the minutes to do it. I think they‚Äôre really going to pound the table that they‚Äôre doing nothing for now. They don‚Äôt want to give in to what the market is pricing in, and that‚Äôs a rate cut,‚Äù said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; Both retail sales and industrial production were weaker than expected in the past week. The coming week is light on data though there are PMI manufacturing data Thursday and durable goods data on Friday.
*****
&gt; Existing home sales Tuesday and new home sales on Thursday could also be an important read on the spring housing market.
*****
&gt; There are a few final earnings reports for the quarter, including major retailers like Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, and Lowe‚Äôs.

# Stocks Stand Tall Against Headwinds

&gt; Renewed trade tensions have led to this latest bout of volatility. The recent drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index felt worse because of how quickly it happened‚Äîfrom new highs to down nearly 5% in less than two weeks. Keep in mind stocks have come pretty far pretty fast, beginning with the strong rally at the first of the year that put the S&amp;P 500 back at record highs.

&gt; Swift rallies like this have also tended to lead to drawdowns as stocks typically have lost some steam midyear‚Äîhence sparking the well-known market adage ‚ÄúSell in May.‚Äù The stock market was probably due for some volatility. The S&amp;P 500 has averaged more than three pullbacks of 5% or more each year since 1990, and we‚Äôre still waiting for our first one this year. ‚ÄúEven though volatility has picked up, and may be with us for a while as risk of a bigger trade war lingers, a pullback or two in the coming months would be totally normal, even with fundamentals still in solid shape,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The U.S. economy continues to grow at a solid pace, it‚Äôs steadily creating jobs, wages are broadly rising, and some benefits of tax reform and other fiscal spending are still flowing through. We expect a pickup in business investment to help extend this economic cycle. Key risks beyond a full-blown trade war include lackluster growth in Europe, a messy U.K. divorce from the Europe Union, and rising geopolitical risk in the Mideast.

&gt; According to the U.S. Treasury, China has cut its holding of U.S. Treasury securities to a 22-month low, potentially in retaliation as the trade dispute lingers. ‚ÄúWhat isn‚Äôt discussed as much, though, is that global demand remains strong, with foreign ownership of U.S. debt hitting a record high last month,‚Äù added Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, China has been decreasing how much U.S. debt it holds, while Japan has silently increased its holdings for five consecutive months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/China-Is-Selling-But-Japan-Is-Buying.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we remain hopeful that the United States and China will reach some kind of a trade agreement‚Äîor at least a trade truce‚Äîin the next few months. President Trump cares about the stock market and the economy, and considers both part of his path to re-election. Both sides have a lot to lose from further escalation. And the two sides already came very close to a deal, which suggests the remaining sticking points can be worked out.

# Pullbacks Happen

&gt; As we noted yesterday, the recent bout of volatility has caught many investors off guard. However, we‚Äôve been saying since late March that some type of normal correction could happen, and we‚Äôve taken a more cautious stance.

&gt; This was one of the best starts to a year ever for equities, which historically has led to modest returns the next six months, with an above average chance of a large correction.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Big-Starts-to-a-Year-Can-Produce-Weak-Results-Going-Forward.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index fell nearly 5% before bouncing back yesterday. Here‚Äôs the catch: 5% pullbacks are actually perfectly normal parts of investing. ‚ÄúAfter a 25% bounce since the lows of December and a near 5% decline, it might feel scary and uncomfortable to investors, but it is important to remember that pullbacks are part of investing,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúTrees don‚Äôt grow forever, and neither do bull runs. A break is usually needed before the eventual resumption of higher returns.‚Äù

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, there has been an average of more than three separate 5% declines for the S&amp;P 500 per year going back to 1990. Given there hasn‚Äôt been a 5% pullback yet this year, we think the odds are quite strong that we see multiple 5% drops the rest of this year as the economic cycle ages and volatility picks up.

# On Again/Off Again Tariffs &amp; It‚Äôs a Pre-Election Year

&gt; Even though it has only been a handful of weeks since these charts were last updated and presented, they do put the last few weeks of trading into a broader view. As of today‚Äôs close, DJIA is up 9.9% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 is even better at 13.7% while NASDAQ is still best at 17.9%. Yes, this is down from late-April/early-May highs, but still solid numbers when compared to this point in past pre-election years and especially all years. The recent pullback and the nascent recovery rally could gather further steam and run until early-July (and perhaps challenge old highs again), but from around mid-July until October seasonality becomes a headwind and more backing and filling is likely again.

# Fed &amp; Tariffs Kick Off ‚ÄúSell(ing) in May‚Äù

&gt; Compared to typical May trading over the recent 21-year period, this May has veered off course earlier than usual. On the first trading day of the month, the Fed harshly squashed budding hopes of an interest rate cut and the viewed was confirmed on the second trading day leading to DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ losses on the first and second instead of typical mild average gains. The market did enjoy a brief rally on the third, but it came to a crashing halt as attentions shifted back to trade negations with China. The implementation of 25% tariffs last Friday was initially overlooked, but the realities of the increasing probability of an extended and tumultuous negation process with China (not to mention another flare-up in the Mideast tensions) are hitting the market today. Should the S&amp;P 500 finish the day down more than 1.9%, it will be the second worst day of the year. Only January 3, 2019 was worse, off 2.5%. If mid-May strength fails to materialize, the second half of May could be worse than the first half.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 5/17/19

&gt; Similar to equity price action, the first half of the week was a bit rough but things finished on much more solid ground for economic data. Small business optimism kicked things off on Monday stronger than both expectations and March‚Äôs reading, coming in at 103.5. Other Monday releases weren‚Äôt as lucky as they broadly came in weaker. Export and import price inflation worsened in April and mortgage delinquencies rose. Fortunately, foreclosures fell 3 basis points down to 0.92%. Empire Manufacturing started Wednesday with a bang coming in at 17.8, more than double estimates of 8.0. But it wasn‚Äôt all good as retail figures for the month of April were weaker across the board and Industrial and Manufacturing Production fell 0.5% alongside weaker Capacity Utilization. Things turned much more positive on Thursday, though, as every release beat expectations. Claims were stronger, the Philly Fed crushed estimates, and Housing Starts and Permits both rose while also beating forecasts. On Friday, Michigan Confidence rose to 102.4 versus expectations of staying at 97.2, ending the week on a very high note.

&gt; Turning to next week, it will be a light data slate with only 14 releases all week. The Chicago Fed releases their National Activity Index Monday morning; the only release that day. Similarly, Existing Home Sales is the sole release Tuesday. Meeting Minutes for the May 1st FOMC meeting will be out Wednesday afternoon. In addition to the standard weekly releases, we will get preliminary Markit PMIs, New Home Sales, and the Kansas City Fed‚Äôs Manufacturing Activity Index on Thursday. Preliminary Durable goods for April rounds things off on Friday with weaker data anticipated.

I buy stocks at let's say 0.50 and as soon as the stock hits .51 or higher I sell it right away .
I usually buy same penny dtock for worth $4000 or 5000 a d depending on the increase i make quick 40 or 50 bucks .
Generally theses stock patterns repeat throughout the day.  Fluctuating  between 0.50 and. 0.51 or so.

Is buying penny stocks worth $4000 to make 40 or 50 bucks per stock increase a good idea .?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I feel I know the answer for myself but maybe would like second opinions since I am not the most experienced.

I am loving MSFT and DIS so far. Long term they'll be great. As for Amazon, I have never used their services, never used SHOP, BABA, JD, not much knowledge on the e-commerce side of business. Therefore, I would like less exposure on that side (some but less than MSFT/DIS) But if I had play around money probably hit some SHOP/JD. As far as banks, I'm with BMO, family with TD so some BMO/TD, loving BMO/TD. -- from Canada.

With the weed market down, was thinking of average down my positions (LHS, APHA, IAN, TRST, MPXI) but thought instead of switching sectors in my portfolio. So adding: MSFT, DIS, BMO, TD and some JD, SHOP.

WKHS is in the middle of a Death Spiral Financing agreement with Arosa Capital Management and Marathon Asset Management. Arosa is owned by Till Bechtolsheimer , grandson of [Karl-Heinz Kipp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Heinz_Kipp), the founder of the Massa [department store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store) chain. [His sisters wedding was attended by the likes of Prince Harry, Prince William, and numerous other prominent royals.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9904867/Duke-and-Duchess-celebrate-friends-wedding-in-Swiss-Alps.html)

[https://imgur.com/MhCJJ1A](https://imgur.com/MhCJJ1A)

At first, it wasn‚Äôt readily apparent who Till Bechtolsheimer was. When he participated in the GP of Monaco racing event, there was an article written about him that pretended he was [some mystery man.](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2017/03/16/cjwrs-renaissance-man-till-bechtolsheimer-reflects-on-first-ctsc-year/)

[https://imgur.com/2FJKH5C](https://imgur.com/2FJKH5C)

It wasn‚Äôt hard to find out who he was though, because in 2014, his girlfriend (I‚Äôm guessing ex girlfriend now) was party to an altercation where it is claimed she[ smashed a beer bottle over the back of a mans head](https://web.archive.org/web/20190509010704/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/family-defend-friend-of-duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge-accused-of-beer-bottle-attack-in-club-9138649.html) for daring to bump into her royal boyfriend at a nightclub. It gets even better. Apparently she was the former vice president of HSBC‚Äôs derivatives and structured products arm in New York. What a coincidence.

Okay, so now that we know who our mystery man is, lets move on to the real story. There was roughly 20 million warrant shares registered in S-3‚Äôs recently acquired pursuant to a loan agreement with Arosa and Marathon last year. Before Trump issued that Royal Pump on twitter, WKHS was trading under $1.00, and risked being delisted by the Nasdaq. Seems very convenient doesn‚Äôt it?

[https://imgur.com/vwxbY4j](https://imgur.com/vwxbY4j) 3/27/19, S-3

[https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9](https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9) S-3 12/26/18

Marathon owns about 10 million warrants, and Arosa 8 million. The exercise price of the warrants has been adjusted down a few times, and as of now they currently sit at $1.25, down from $2.00. The circumstances surrounding how Arosa received these warrants is most unusual‚Ä¶

[https://imgur.com/IS93T8g](https://imgur.com/IS93T8g)

Huh?‚Ä¶.So Arosa loans the company money, then 5 months later they get paid back with a new loan from a completely different lender, but they get to keep the 5 million warrants? That‚Äôs one hell of a deal don't you think?

Workhorse also recently sold a large asset to Duke Energy, which at the time was being used as collateral in the Arosa loan agreement. Personally, and this is completely my opinion, this transaction reminds me of what they refer to as a [‚Äúbust out‚Äù ](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/24/bain-capital-tony-soprano_n_1542249.html). Many of you remember how Mitt Romney affiliated Bain Capital would lend to struggling companies under aggressive terms, [loot the company of the their assets, then fire everybody](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-183291/). Activity like this is not uncommon in death spiral financing arrangements. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for the borrower to secure financing, but due to desperation, they will agree to whatever terms are available with the hope that things might turn around. This isn‚Äôt the kind of behavior you‚Äôd expect from a company in legitimate talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown Complex, a 6.2 million square foot facility (getting to that soon).

[https://imgur.com/U49I51k](https://imgur.com/U49I51k)

One of the covenants of the Arosa loan is that Workhorse is to sell [Surefly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2018/10/23/meet-surefly-a-hybrid-electric-helicopter-that-looks-like-a-drone/), one of their most important assets. They manufacturer an interesting Multicopter prototype, something that, with the right leadership, has true potential.

[https://imgur.com/LFngngO](https://imgur.com/LFngngO)

They also accrued a warranty liability of 6.9 million in 2018 for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of money to put aside, and a colossal fuck up considering the timing. They are barely scraping by.

[https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF](https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF)

Just one look at their operations makes it pretty clear that the dilution is not even close to being over. Yes, that‚Äôs a quarterly..

[https://imgur.com/u3DKNn4](https://imgur.com/u3DKNn4)

They even tell you they don‚Äôt have enough money to make it through to the second half of THIS year, not next year‚Ä¶THIS year! Seriously?! And Trump pumped this thing????!!! This is insanity! He is supposed to be the president of the United States, supposedly the greatest military strength in world history, the Commander-In-Chief, and he is pumping this POS.....

[https://imgur.com/9JMFGMX](https://imgur.com/9JMFGMX)

Also, they admit that the financing from Arosa and Marathon is explicitly for further inventory purchases. No mention of capital expenditure.

[https://imgur.com/IokM41c](https://imgur.com/IokM41c) 10k

Net sales went down 93%????‚Ä¶..Okay, lets take a step back here. 2017 sales were 10 million, and in 2018 sales were $700k? The expenses are almost the same for both years though. If you do the math, 2018 expenses were 3000% of net sales!!! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶WTF??!! The question we have to ask ourselves now is HOW DO THEY EXPECT TO BUY A 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT 902 ACRE PRODUCTION FACILITY WHEN THEY HAVE VIRTUALLY NO SALES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING UP TO THEIR PANTS IN DEBT TO EUROPEAN NOBILITY!!!!! THIS IS AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE, OR AS TRUMP LIKES SAYING, ‚ÄúA DISGRACE‚Äù!!!!!!

Last, but not least, their competitors are massive corporations with 100‚Äôs of years of combined experience..I could keep going on, but I think you get the point by now. The company is facing bankruptcy, had virtually no sales last year, and the covenants in the loan agreement require them to sell one of their most important assets. They put aside 7 million for a warranty liability for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù, while selling another few million in batteries to Duke Energy. [Also, the founder recently left, someone who had been with the company for almost a decade!](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/05/1711059/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Promotes-President-and-Chief-Operating-Officer-Duane-Hughes-to-Chief-Executive-Officer.html)

Of course most online discussion is centered around US stocks, it's harder to find resources regarding my local market since Sweden is a fairly small country (although our economy is doing... okay I guess). Most of the companies in businesses I feel like a have a grasp on are based in the US, and it's obviously a dominant economy so a lot of shooting stars are american.

The local brokers here usually have higher fees for trading in US stock, the trading volume is lower on smaller companies, and some smaller penny stocks aren't even traded at all. Some statistics don't work properly on US stocks either etc. Overall it feels like an inferior experience compared to buying local stocks, but on the other hand I feel like it's easier to understand, and also since it's a much bigger economy it's potentially less vulnerable than the Swedish one.

Can it do it again?](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkenkam%2F2019%2F05%2F15%2Famd-ready-to-run-again-as-zombieload-attacks-intel%2F&amp;text=AMD%20ran%20up%2069%25%20last%20year.%20Can%20it%20do%20it%20again%3F) Tony Mitchell, who has outperformed all U.S. equity mutual funds for the last 10 and 15 years, first told us to buy AMD in January 2018 and made it his top pick for 2019. History may be repeating itself as Intel CPUs have recently been revealed to be vulnerable to a new attack called Zombieload, that does not appear to affect AMD CPUs.

**Why AMD Ran Up 69% Last Year**

In January 2018, When Intel revealed announced their CPUs were vulnerable to attacks called Spectre and Meltdown, they released software patches to address the problem. However, early reports surfaced that the patches reduced Intel's CPU performance between 5% and 25%. Intel said that the performance degradation was work-load dependent and since most people don't fully utilize their CPU they would not notice it.

While true about most users, there are customers who do fully utilize their CPUs -- corporate datacenters. For these customers, installing a patch that reduces CPU performance by 25% is like a 25% price increase because they now have to buy 5 CPUs to do the same work that 4 used to do.

This did not immediately benefit AMD because Intel said that Spectre and Meltdown were industry-wide problems meaning that AMD CPUs were equally affected. This turned out to be only partially true.

AMD CPUs are significantly less vulnerable to Spectre and Meltdown because AMD CPUs do not use the feature that these attacks exploit. While not immune from these attacks, AMD's software patches do not exact the same performance penalty as Intel's. The advantage AMD gained in the datacenter market is largely why the stock ran up 69% in 2018.

**It's Happening Again**

The researchers who discovered Spectre and Meltdown have discovered a new vulnerability they call Zombieload which affects all Intel CPUs since 2011. Importantly, they say AMD CPUs do not appear to be affected.

Apple just announced that enabling the software patches to fully mitigate Zombieload, which they call Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS), caused as much as a 40% performance reduction in their testing. I want to see what kind of performance degradation occurs on Red Hat, Centos, Ubuntu and other flavors of Linux, but this is looking good for AMD.

**My Take**: While Intel will no doubt have a way to spin this news that is more favorable to them, I'd rather depend on Tony Mitchell's views when it comes to the investment implications.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Tony first bought AMD in October 2014 at $3.45. He recommended AMD in January 2018 and made it his [top pick for 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2019/01/21/amd-is-top-internet-fund-managers-top-pick-for-2019) when it was at $19. At today‚Äôs price of $27, he has already made a lot of money on his original investment and he sees a lot more upside in 2019.

Tony's Internet Fund has an 18+ year track record that extends through 2 market crashes, numerous corrections, and sector rotations. Over that period, Tony averaged 17.50% a year which compares well to the S&amp;P 500's 5.83% return for the same period. He is up 31% year-to-date vs. 18% for the S&amp;P 500.

I've been following this one penny for a while now that still seems to be relatively unknown. I highly suggest checking them out and doing some DD. I think they are due for a very large bump in share price shortly. Some info that makes me bullish on them is that they have recently paid off existing debt, they were uplisted from pinks to QB and have already applied for the NASDAQ, they developed their own block chain network and paired with UPS for product distribution, they already have contracts to roll out their products and services to 40,000 stores this year which they are currently in the process of, they created a free smart phone service supported by ads to provide phone service for low income families and created their own visa reloadable debit cards which will be able to act similar to a checking account for the under banked. They just opened a new finance, legal and administrative office to help manage the expansion and they got their logo trademarked.

Overall, quite happy with this scalp. To be honest, I got incredibly lucky in timing it right around the time the Trump news came out today. I originally entered in with +4 /ES, when the market over reacted initially around [here](https://i.imgur.com/wN4gwo0.png) (it was impossible to get filled at my initial order so I left it open) then added +2 when it dropped a bit after the initial green moment. I sat around with a few alerts set up to keep me alert on the position. I set a trailing stop once it broke past \~2850 and let it ride from there. I ended up getting kicked from my position around 2856.5 for a grand total of $6000. All in around an hour and a half or so. I probably missed some profits since we're only around noon right now, but it's all good.

Translation from Dutch to English:

# VU discovers megaleak in Intel chips

Thanks to a mistake, the VU uncovered a mega breach in Intel chips. Intel pays the price for a fast but risky design.

The news in brief:

* **Researchers from the VU University Amsterdam have found an extensive data breach that is present in all Intel processors. These chips are in more than 80 percent of all computers and servers.**
* **On Tuesday evening, Intel and VU announced the details of RIDL (Rogue In-Flight Data Load), a vulnerability that allows malicious parties to ""steal almost all data"" from computers. Unauthorized persons can view the data that the processor is currently processing.**
* **The vulnerability is in all Intel processors of the last ten years - including the very latest. Hackers can exploit the vulnerability by hiding code in a web advertisement.**

Two rack cabinets from the Ikea full of computer walls, a jumble of cables and a stack of second-hand processors. It is not immediately the test lab that you expect from which VU University researchers uncovered the sophisticated, super-complex leak in recent months.

Here, in room P455, on the fourth floor of the W&amp;N building in Amsterdam, it was demonstrated that all Intel processors of the past ten years are susceptible to a major leak. This means that more than 80 percent of all computers in the world are susceptible to an attack that gives access to data at the heart of the computer.

RIDL, as the new vulnerability was baptized, came to light by chance. On Tuesday 11 September, Stephan van Schaijk, Computer Science student at VU University Amsterdam, worked on his study assignment: investigating a leak in the Intel processor.

Van Schaijk: ‚ÄûI was busy for an hour but did not advance. I adjusted something in my code and then I saw something strange appear on the screen. Values ‚Äã‚ÄãI did not expect. ""

Van Schaijk had made a mistake, a bug in a bug, with which he could suddenly watch what happened in another program. It was a bigger and more serious leak than he was actually looking for.

His colleagues and teachers were just as surprised. Together, they wrote more than 20 ""exploits"" attack scenarios in a short time that would allow hackers to take control of the computer.

One of those tricks: by logging in with an incorrect password, the attacker forces the computer to compare the wrong password with the correct password. This data runs through the 'pipelines' of the chip and can be intercepted, after which the hacker can retrieve the correct password after some tinkering. ""You find fragments. As if you are going to get a paper document through the shredder and then reassemble the shreds, ‚Äùsays Herbert Bos, professor of system and network security at the VU.

Stephan van Schaijk was sent out to buy as many different processors as possible, to see if they were all vulnerable.

And that was true. Even the oldest one, from 2008, that was picked up via Marktplaats, turned out to be vulnerable to RIDL, or Rogue In-Flight Data Load. And so, Intel was immediately warned.

A beer please

It is not the first time that Intel gets into trouble with a leak in its processors. The chip is extra fast because it is ahead of things: each time the processor speculates which data is probably needed next. This presents risks because computer processes do not remain well separated from each other.

Assistant professor Kaveh Razavi compares it to a caf√©: the processor works like a waitress who assumes that you want to drink the same as the one before you. The glass is poured automatically without the waitress checking whether you can have that beer.

The solution: the tray must be emptied after every order. That makes the processor slower. Depending on the programs you use, the speed difference can be considerable, the researchers expect. That explains why Intel has been struggling so long to fix this leak.

RIDL cuts right through all existing security layers. This applies to the data centers where virtual systems often run on the same server. The encrypted environment that Intel devised for business customers is also vulnerable.

Premium with aftertaste

Although parts of the leak were found by several researchers from different universities and companies, the VU has discovered the majority. Amsterdam University is also the only party to receive a reward: $100,000 (89,000 euros), Intel's maximum reward for discoverers of critical leaks.

There is a small taste to the premium. **According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and ""$80,000"" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**

Anyone who accepts a reward must also adhere to the rules. In this case, that meant: no consultation between researchers and uncertainty about which software manufacturers were warned in advance. According to the researchers, tech companies do not reason in the interests of the user, but of the shareholder.

Intel initially failed to notify Google and Mozilla, two major browser manufacturers.

The VU tried to force the manufacturer to come out faster. Eventually the VU forced Intel to come out in May - otherwise the university would publish the details itself. ""**If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months**,"" says Bos.

Intel had promised that the next generation of chips would not be vulnerable to RIDL, but that is not the case.

Hackers usually anticipate software vulnerabilities. Undiscovered holes (zero days) in important programs are sold for a lot of money in the black circuit. But after Specter and Meltdown, two fundamental holes that were previously found in Intel chips, both the ethical computer experts and the criminal figures are pointing their hardware. ""Processors have become so complex that chip makers no longer have security under control,"" said Bos.

And what should you do as a computer user? Update, update and update again. It is expected that all major software manufacturers will close the gap or have already closed the latest releases.

When security researchers disclosed a series of¬†major vulnerabilities¬†impacting Intel processors back in January 2018, it was clear that ‚ÄúMeltdown‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpectre‚Äù were¬†indeed serious¬†‚Äî and wouldn‚Äôt be the only exploits of multi-threading chips. Now a new Intel chip vulnerability nicknamed ‚ÄúZombieLoad‚Äù has been¬†revealed to the public, and though it‚Äôs already being patched by three major operating system makers, there‚Äôs some bad news: full protection could reduce your CPU‚Äôs performance by up to 40%.
In a just-published¬†support document,¬†Apple suggests that full ZombieLoad mitigation will require Intel chip users to disable Intel‚Äôs hyper-threading processing feature ‚Äî a major selling point of the chipmaker‚Äôs CPUs. During testing this month, Apple says that it found ‚Äúas much as a 40 percent reduction in performance with tests that include multithreaded workloads and public benchmarks,‚Äù though actual performance impacts will vary between machines.
Google and Microsoft (via¬†TechCrunch) have also started the process of patching their Intel-based operating systems. In¬†Google‚Äôs case, Chrome OS devices have already received some protections and will receive more in the next OS release; Intel-only Android devices are rare, but will receive OS patches once device makers deploy them. Microsoft is releasing¬†patches¬†for Windows today, and has already protected Azure users. Some microcode processor updates will come from Microsoft directly, and others from device makers.
The ZombieLoad issue was apparently disclosed to Intel one month ago, and impacts all Intel processors produced since 2011. Chips from AMD and ARM are not believed to be susceptible to this flaw. According to vendors, there are no known real-world exploits of the vulnerability at this point, though the researchers simply say that they don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been abused in the wild.

I was looking into adding some dividend stocks to my portfolio. Currently looking at Nokia, because I think they have a nice upside potential aswell, and a nice little dividend percentage.

Furthermore I saw OXLC with a very high (16%) dividend rate, it did go from about 20$ to about 10.50$ in 8,5 years, but even if you bought at the 20$ peak, you have had 8 years of high dividend.

Doesn‚Äôt this mean that stocks with a high short interest have a higher upwards potential since there‚Äôs the possibility of a short squeeze?

For example a stock with 0% short interest simply moves up and down based on buying and selling, but short interest seems to essentially be the equivalent of selling too. 

So if you purchase a stock with 50% short interest (just an example) and it goes up say 5%, and the shorters get scared and exit their positions, doesn‚Äôt that mean it would go up even more (if that‚Äôs what a short squeeze is anyway)?

I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if it may be better to look at companies with good fundamentals and high short interest as it is, since I‚Äôm thinking that might mean there‚Äôs even more room to go up.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

VFISX and VUSTX. Both are &gt; 99% U.S. Government Bonds.

VUSTX shows a lot of movement in price making it less attractive.

Preserving capital

Which is somewhat chicken and egg, but in 2008's case, it was the sub-prime mortgage crisis. So what happens in ____?

My new hunch says we finally have an impending trigger for a similar but less severe contraction in the market. I think it will start with the end of the current wave of IPOs as UBER and Lyft become insolvent. 

Combined, Uber and Lyft employ almost 3,000,000 Americans (sorry, I mean CUSTOMERS). The labor force is likely to contract by somewhere between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000 jobs during the next downturn, so this figure alone is sufficient for up to half of the potential losses needed for a correction. Automation in retail and transportation is likely to result in significant additional losses into the aforementioned range. And construction is also likely to be impacted quite badly. 

Now, while the above is not inevitable, I think it is likely. Next, we look at the housing market across the country. 

With losses sustained deeply from 2008-2012, I calculated the max deviation (spring 2012 in most cities) from 2000 values, and used that to gauge the state of the market in the 20 metro areas the Case Schiller Index covers. The below numbers show what value we could expect IF A DOWNTURN OCCURS based on rolling forward the resiliency (or lack thereof depending on the metro) of 2008-2012's numbers.  

Metro area / 2019 Case Schiller # / 2020-2024 Case Schiller bottom # / 2007-12 bottom change / 2019-2024 bottom change compared to 2008-12

SFO: 258-&gt;150 (-41.9%) (-42.7%) (+.8%)

Portland: 232-&gt;158 (-31.9%) (-31.0%) (-.9%)

Seattle: 244-&gt;158 (-35.3%) (-32.8%) (-2.5%)

Cleveland: 122-&gt;88 (-28.9%) (-23.6%) (-5.3%)

Atlanta: 149-&gt;66 (-45.7%) (-39%) (-6.7%)

Charlotte: 160-&gt;118 (-26.3%) (-18.8%) (-7.5%)
 
Denver: 216-&gt;144 (-33.3%) (-12.9%) (-20.4%)

Dallas: 188-&gt;126 (-33.0%) (-11.3%) (-21.7%)

Detroit: 123-&gt;36 (-73.3%) (-46.5%) (-26.8%)

As you can see, home prices this boom have increased VERY unevenly and very differently from 2000-&gt;2007 in most metro areas. It would appear most metros (12/20) are more resilient to the next downturn, however, there are a handful that appear to be substantially more inflated this cycle than last, which could be in for particularly nasty shocks by 2024 (Detroit, Dallas, Denver, Charlotte and Atlanta round out the worst potential vs. the last recession, although Vegas home prices could still decrease by almost 60% this bust). 

Looking at housing prices, one has to ask: what is fundamentally different from the last bust? We may have stricter lending policies, but is there any SUSTAINABLE reason Vegas home prices have returned to 2007 levels, or is the same thing happening? And I think the same thing is happening -- incomes and employment have surely not doubled since 2012, in Vegas or anywhere else. And perspectives in DC + NYC are doubly-clouded because in these regions, there really ISN'T much of a bubble, as prices stabilized and didn't run up after 2012 after remaining highest in the country vs. other metros compared to the 2000 baseline. 

So, my thesis is as follows. 

1) UBER and LYFT IPOs are amongst a slew of cash-grabs at the market high as easy money begins to run dry. 

2) UBER and LYFT are going to fail within 1-2 years, probably closer to 1 year. The failure of the current tech boom could be catalyst to a brief severe market correction and a more sustained substantial adjustment. Perhaps 30% at height of the crash but new all-time highs will still be set within a few years (by 2024 / 2025). Most sectors will recover fairly quickly, except those that go bust entirely (ridesharing, possibly co-working / WEWORK). 

3) When the market crashes thanks to the failure of UBER and LYFT, there is going to be a substantial component of the US labor force that becomes instantaneously unemployed. With home prices already falling, this sets off the larger changes that spiral through the bottom of the economy resulting in decreased consumer spending and additional layoffs within 1-2 years in peripheral industries. 

4) The employment downturn coincides with a worsening drop in housing prices, and the market spirals to levels worse than 2008 in a handful of markets. Dallas and Denver have both seen unprecedented growth and are the most iconic ""new"" examples of the 2020 recession. But Las Vegas, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Detroit also take it on the chin, slightly better or substantially worse than 2008-2012. I would wager that ride-sharing underwrites or allows a very substantial portion of mortgages being written in these metros (5-10%), which become the prime catalyst of a focused but severe housing bust. 

5) By 2024, the worst of the bust will be over, with home prices nationally averaging a relatively minor 20% correction from 2018 prices. At this point, the worst-impacted areas will still be at lows, while some cities, led by DC and NYC, surpass #s seen in the late 2010s. Unemployment will become increasingly systemic as new opportunities dwindle with the worsening shift to automated labor.

2.when the fed buys or sells massive amounts of bonds in order to manipulate the money supply, will that not make it a bigger problem in the long term, like if they sell bonds wont that lower the short term money supply but increase the long term supply since interest has to be paid on those bonds?.

Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 13th, 2019.

# **What to watch in the week ahead: Trade chatter, key economic data and Walmart earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/what-to-watch-in-the-week-ahead-trade-chatter-key-economic-data-and-walmart-earnings.html)**
*****
&gt; Important data on the consumer and manufacturing is released in the week ahead, and investors are watching to see what it says about two key parts of the economy as new tariffs go into effect on Chinese goods.
*****
&gt; The economic reports should show how the economy is faring so far in the second quarter, following a surprisingly strong first quarter. Analysts say the better economy gave President Donald Trump some leverage in his trade negotiations with China.
*****
&gt; But it's the progress of those trade negotiations that the markets care about most in the week ahead, after investors were surprised by a lack of progress in the talks and new tariffs this past week.
*****
&gt; On Friday, stocks erased steep losses and bounced higher after both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump called the first negotiating session following new tariffs ""constructive.""
*****
&gt; Retail sales for April are released Wednesday, and should give a good view of consumer spending as the second quarter got underway. Also on Wednesday, industrial production, business inventories and the Empire State manufacturing survey are reported. Consumers sentiment is out Friday. Besides the data, there are just a few earnings, with Walmart reporting Thursday, and Macy's on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Stocks closed out a volatile week lower, and the S&amp;P 500's 2.2% decline was still its worst of the year.
*****
&gt; ""The odds of something going wrong are much higher today than they were last Friday, when there was pretty much consensus that a [trade] deal was going to be done,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
&gt; But strategists say the selling could have been even worse in the past week. They said stocks were supported by investor confidence that a deal will get done, and also the expectation that Trump would take action to avoid a market collapse.
*****
&gt; ""I still think that the risks are perhaps skewed more to the downside, than the upside here. Whether it will escalate further is hard to handicap from a risk perspective,"" Keon said. The Trump administration has complained that China attempted to renegotiate their deal, so Trump raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in goods and threatens tariffs on $300 billion more.
*****
&gt; Whether the Chinese have changed their view, or their lack of agreement on some issues is just posturing is yet to be seen, Keon said.
*****
&gt; ""The U.S. and China are rivals and are going to be economic rivals for many years to come. Doing a trade deal is going to be like the Yankees and Red Sox doing a trade deal. Nobody wants to be the guy who trades away Babe Ruth,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said it's not unusual for trade negotiations to hit a rough spot, as they near the finish line. ""What really matters is whether you have those tariffs on for quite some time. Companies have been doing fairly well managing tariffs, whether it's by supply lines or price. The uncertainty is the problem for firms,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he expects to see strength in the retail sales. Manufacturing data could be soft.
*****
&gt; ""Our take is that the consumer is still in a very good place. We think a lot of the volatility, some of it was real in the sense it was the government shutdown and the movement of the stock market through December. There were some seasonal adjustments,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Analysts have said the fact the stock market was at a record high; first quarter growth was a strong 3.2%, and unemployment fell to a 50-year low of 3.6%, all likely emboldened Trump to play hardball with China. Likewise, improving economic data in China could have made Beijing believe it had a stronger hand.
*****
&gt; For now, markets are watching to see whether talks continue to be constructive or whether the two sides focus on retaliation.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he expects to see a deal, but if it looks like Trump will move forward with tariffs on all Chinese goods, he would reconsider his stock positions. ""If that was coming and we thought that was going to be in place for some time, we would be forced to reevaluate and downgraded our economic outlook and also the outlook for the markets,"" said Tilley.

# Earnings Estimates Stand Firm

&gt; Earnings growth projections have remained positive globally, even as trade tensions have rattled financial markets this week.

&gt; Lately, headlines on the U.S.-China trade dispute have distracted investors, and a few pockets of the global economy have weakened over the last several months. Fixed income markets have positioned for a marked economic slowdown with the yield curve again nearing inversion (long-term rates falling below short-term rates).

&gt; Uncertainty can be uncomfortable, but in times of market volatility, we encourage investors to focus on long-term fundamentals instead of short-term noise. One of the fundamental pillars we like to focus on is company earnings.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, earnings in all three major global regions are expected to rise this year. U.S. companies are poised to lead, with consensus expectations for 4.2% profit growth in 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/U.S.-Leads-Earnings-Growth-Prospects-for-2019-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúThe bar for earnings results is low because of heightened uncertainty,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúEconomic growth may be moderating internationally, but we see enough catalysts ahead to drive another year of record profits in the U.S.‚Äù

&gt; U.S. company profits escaped last quarter‚Äôs soft patch, based on earnings results from about 85% of constituents that have already reported. S&amp;P 500 Index profits likely grew about 1% year over year in the first quarter of 2019, markedly better than the 2‚Äì4% decline expected at the beginning of the reporting season, depending on the data source. Better-than-feared earnings have helped push the S&amp;P 500 to all-time highs over the past few weeks and we expect improving earnings to carry stocks going forward.

&gt; Earnings expectations for developed and emerging markets (EM) are below U.S. projections. However, we think EM earnings projections may be too pessimistic. Global market volatility, trade tensions, and a strong U.S. dollar have contributed to reduced EM growth expectations in recent months, but we think the Federal Reserve‚Äôs pause should help cap gains in the U.S. dollar and help fuel stronger global currencies and EM economic activity.

# Uncomfortable, but Expected

&gt; Trade tensions have flared up again, and they‚Äôve caught the stock market off guard.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has dropped 2.1% over the past two days amid a slew of trade-related headlines. On May 6, the United States announced it would implement additional tariffs on Chinese imports at the end of the week if no trade agreement is reached. In response, China threatened its own retaliatory measures. China and U.S. officials are still scheduled to continue trade talks in Washington, D.C. May 9, but the threat of escalation looms large in investors‚Äô minds.

&gt; Recent market volatility has been uncomfortable, but not particularly surprising given the lack of turbulence year to date. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs largest pullback this year has been unusually small relative to previous years. Since 1970, the S&amp;P 500 has made it through the first five months of the year without at least a 2.5% pullback only once‚Äîin 1995.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019s-Biggest-Drawdown-is-the-Smallest-Since-1995.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; On average, the S&amp;P 500 has endured an 8.5% pullback from January to May each year. This year, stocks haven‚Äôt come close to that. The largest S&amp;P 500 pullback this year has been a one-day slide of 2.48%.

&gt; ‚ÄúGiven the recent run we‚Äôve had, we believe conditions are ripe for an increase in volatility,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúThough we remain optimistic about U.S. stocks‚Äô longer-term prospects, stocks recently reached overbought levels.‚Äù

&gt; While volatility could take over in the near term, we see the resurgence in trade risk as a temporary obstacle to new S&amp;P 500 highs later this year. In our view, current trade headwinds will have a negligible impact on economic growth, and the U.S. economy has emerged relatively unscathed from what is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year. Economic fundamentals also point to higher prices: The labor market is steadily improving, corporate profits are at all-time highs, and inflation is healthy.

&gt; In the meanwhile, we look for S&amp;P 500 support in the 2,775 range, the index‚Äôs 200-day moving average. If this level were to be reached, it would represent a 6% slide from record levels, and at the low range of a typical 6-10% market correction. Solid fundamentals and technical support may provide investors with potential for relief from the recent bout of market volatility.

# May Option Expiration Week: Recent Weakness

&gt; Trading around May option expiration is mostly a mixed bag. DJIA has been down nineteen of the last thirty-seven May expiration days with an average loss of 0.12%. The full-week has a bearish bias for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 with records of 20 declines and 17 advances over the past 37 years. More recently, DJIA has suffered declines in eight of the past ten expiration weeks.

# Rotate in May ‚Äî Top Sectors for the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù May to October

&gt; Today we are not going to bother debating whether one should actually sell in May or not. Instead, let‚Äôs focus on some tactical adjustments that can be made in portfolios to take advantage of what actually does work during the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù while either shorting or outright avoiding what does not work all that frequently.

&gt; In the following table, the performance of the S&amp;P 500 during the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù May to October is compared to fourteen select sector indices or sub-indices, gold and the 30-year Treasury bond. Nine of the fourteen indices chosen are S&amp;P Sector indices. Gold and 30-year bond are continuously-linked, non-adjusted front-month futures contracts. With the exception of two indices, 1990-2018, a full 29 years of data was selected. This selection represents a reasonably balanced number of bull and bear years for each and a long enough timeframe to be statistically significant while representing current trends. In an effort to make an apple-to-apple comparison, dividends are not included in this study.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef156141ee3a14742dbf8c91837f80f/tumblr_inline_pr9c02KFIg1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; Using the S&amp;P 500 as the baseline by which all others were compared, five indices and the 30-year Treasury bond outperformed during the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù while nine others and gold underperformed based upon ‚ÄúAVG %‚Äù return. At the top of the list are Biotech and Healthcare with average gains of 8.69% and 4.85% during the ‚ÄúWorst Months.‚Äù However, before jumping into Biotech positions, only 24 years of data was available and in those years, Biotech was up just 54.2% of the time from May through October. Some years, like 2014, gains were massive while in down years losses were frequently nearly as large. Although not the best sector by AVG %, Consumer Staples advancing 79.3% of the time is the closest thing to a sure bet for a gain during the ‚ÄúWorst Months.‚Äù

# Market Celebrates Mother‚Äôs Day with Gains

&gt; Over the last twenty-four years on the Friday before Mother‚Äôs Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground sixteen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times. Average gain on Friday has been 0.19% and a respectable 0.49% on Monday. However, in four of the last seven years, the Monday following Mother‚Äôs Day has been down.

# Relax It‚Äôs May Not China Trade War Fears

&gt; A full blown trade war with China is not in anyone‚Äôs interest. President Trump‚Äôs negotiating style may be unsettling to the market at times, but neither country is likely to stand on ceremony to save face at the risk to their respective economies and markets. With the market at new highs and up big the first four months this year it is even more prone to short-term weakness in May.

&gt; Our overall outlook for the year remains bullish as it has been since our Annual Forecastin December that was followed by a bullish January Indicator Trifecta. The historical strength of Pre-Election Years, which has been self-evident thus far this year, is supported by resilient economic and corporate readings, a dovish Fed clearly done with raising interest rates for the time being and a White House that is supportive of Wall Street. But, as you can see in the chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns below, the Dow (black dotted line) and S&amp;P (green dotted line) are already at historical average gains for the Pre-Election year and NASDAQ is way ahead of the pace up more than 20% for 2019 to date.

&gt; Ostensibly, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are on the brink of clearing the last levels of resistance. But the Dow is struggling and Russell 2000 is well off the pace. S&amp;P and NASDAQ made new all-time highs last month, but are straining to hold those levels and there is chatter in technical analysis circles about a bearish double top forming on the S&amp;P and NASDAQ. Also evident in the chart here is the weakness often experienced in the latter part of May. So while we remain bullish on the year, we do expect the market to be weaker during the May soft patch and backing and filing during the Worst 4 Months July-October.

Nothing crazy. Just buying and selling at market value. 

However, I've been reading up on shorting and have a very basic understanding of how it works...but it has me intrigued. 

So I understand the whole borrowing shares then giving it back at some point in the future and essentially keeping or paying the difference. I know that it is extremely risky (not looking for everyone to say this and tell me too stay away from this type of trading) but I have also read it can be extremely  profitable. This leads me into some questions that I hope yall could help answer. 

1. Is there a minimum investment required? I know with certain ETFs and mutual funds they require a minimum investment of 2500, 5000, etc. Since it is a risky practice I would prefer to only purchase one or two shares and see how it plays out. 

2. Is there a minimum time required that I hold the stock before giving it back? Like if I shorted a stock of something and things started going sideways would I be able to give it back immediately? 

3. When does the money hit my account? It's not like I'm taking a loan from the stock market and seeing that money up front right? I'm assuming I would see it when it comes time to give the stock back..granted the share price fell and the short was profitable.

On the 27th it dropped another 500 pts but a late day reversal propped it back up 600 pts at days end.

It then compares the data points to that of the stock price in a nice-looking chart. Now you can out-trade those pesky kids at WallStreetBets who think they know everything by doing the opposite of what they do!

(PS this is not financial advice whatsoever).

# How It Works

&amp;#x200B;

**WallStreetBets - Sentiment**:

The tool scrapes WallStreetBets ""hot"" topics and scans for any tickers mentioned in the topic title. If a ticker or company name (ie: Amazon for $AMZN) is found, it continues to scan the comments of said topic. It then grabs the most-upvoted comments and does a ""bag of words"" neural network sentiment scan, meaning that sentence structure and word context is lost as it scans the comment word by word. Sentiment from 1 to 100 is positive (100 being most positive) and -1 to -100 is negative. Once the scan is complete it logs the current stock price of whatever ticker was mentioned and stores the score in a database (so we can go back looking at the different sentiment).

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I don't scan ALL comments from WSB?**

The reason I don't scan every topic and every comment (including daily discussion) is because there are too many comments with low scores. This means any Joe-WallStreetBets could make a comment and the program would analyze the sentiment accordingly which might potentially sway sentiment results. Instead, I've found that the most-upvoted posts are generally a consensus of the people in WSB and have given those topics/comments priority over all others.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, a post with 200 upvotes saying TSLA is going to the moon will hold more water than one random saying buy TSLA puts with 3 upvotes. I've found due to the simplicity of most comments there is approximately 70% success rate on the scans, so it's fairly accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Keyword/Slang Analysis**:

Do you absolutely hate it anytime they use slang in the forum? Tendies? Stock going to the moon? ""Risk-Free""?! What does all this nonsense even mean!? Only god knows, but now you can avoid any of those stocks like the plague because in the ""Keywords"" column of the sentiment section, I've also logged when any of their preferred slang terms have been mentioned in a thread (tendies, risk-free, going to the moon, btfd, going tits up, or not going tits up).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if you click a stock ticker in the site it will show you a chart of the stock's price as well as the sentiment that has been logged in the last 3 months. All sentiment is tied to a trading day, so sentiment that has been logged on a weekend will be tied to the following Monday trading day (I found this was a better way to compare the stock price with the sentiment).

&amp;#x200B;

**WallStreetBets - Trending Stocks:**

These lists are pretty straightforward.

**Controversial Stocks**: These are the stocks where the sentiment sways often from positive to negative.

**Bullish/Bearish Stocks**: These are the stocks where average sentiment is mostly in one direction (with a minimum of 2 entries).

&amp;#x200B;

**WallStreetBets - Due Diligence:**

So, for the due diligence section I log every thread that has been posted throughout the day and every evening I read EVERY SINGLE ARTICLE. I skim the article to first see if the quality of content is decent (real DD vs shitpost DD) and then I log each individual ticker mentioned and the sentiment on it. Each DD also has a sub-category (Fundamentals/Research, Earnings/Insider (like insider buys/sells)/technicals/discussion. The stock price is logged on the date the DD was made, so it's a good reference point to see:

**1**. Who's been posting good DD (good to follow a user or request them to be banned from r/stocks), and

**2**. If the logged DD has any value whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future Updates:**

I have a few future updates/features I want to work on that I might implement (be able to enhance the sorting and filtering of the data to make it easier for you guys to navigate around the site, find posts by specific users, and even keep track of big YOLOs). That way you can completely avoid any wallstreetbet user or data point at ALL TIMES.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is half serious and half as a joke, but the tool is real (link below, also uses HTTPS for security). If any of you have a question or comment about the tool I will be happy to answer. Cheers!

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Key Stats**

* Q1 revenue of $776.0 million vs. $739 million estimated, 5% beat, -10.8% price reaction
* Q1 EBIT of $-1,156.9 million vs. $-575.46 million estimated, -101% miss
* Q1 net loss of $1,138.5 million, adjusted net loss of $228.4 million
* Q1 Adjusted EBITDA of $-216 million¬†
* Q1 Contribution margin (Lyft's KPI Gross Profit metric,rev-cost of rev ex cost of rev items amortization, sbc, and change in insurance reserves) increased to 49.6% from 35.4% in Q12018

**Guidance**

* Q2 Revenue guide $800-$810 million, $809 million mean street estimate, $803 million our model estimates
* Q2 Adjusted EBITDA loss guide $270-$280 million, $277.4 million mean of estimates
* FY 2019 Revenue guide between $3.275 billion and $3.3 billion (52-53% implied growth), $3306 million mean estimate, $3333 million our model estimates
* FY 2019 Adjusted EBITDA loss between $1.15 billion-$1.175 billion, $1.178 million mean estimate
   * 3-5 pps increase in O&amp;S expenses for next 3 quarters relative to Q1 (peak in Q3 2019)
   * Q2 non-GAAP R&amp;D (exclusion of SBC) will increase 2 pps from Q1 to Q2 and up 2 pps from Q2 to Q3 and Q4
   * S&amp;M to decline to 28% of revenue in Q2 and remain at such a level for the rest of 2019
   * Non-GAAP G&amp;A as a percent of revenue will increase 4 pps in Q2 from Q1 and peak at 26% of revenue in Q3 and Q4

**Observations/Scrutiny**

* It is moderately troubling that gross bookings isn't being reported especially when the counter intuitive explanation for not doing so were to avoid ""investor confusion"" as other segments of the business which have a negligible impact on the top line are areas where revenue equals gross bookings, i.e. Lyft owns their own capital in their e-scooter business. Gross bookings is a metric useful in deriving an understanding of the scale of a given TNC and calculating the implied take rate which is one component in forecasting driver liquidity and utilization rates. Reporting of ride milestones ""from time to time"" is a step down in the level of disclosure from the S-1 too. However, less disclosure on rides may be justifiable given that there are bike subscriptions that Lyft offers where an unlimited amount of bike rides are accessible for a fixed dollar amount.¬†
* Brian Roberts (CFO) cites reduction of S&amp;M as a percent of revenue from 127% to 54% to 37% by 2018. This statistic isn't impressive as revenue has increased by 141% to 75% to 48% and is a testament to the benefits of businesses reliant on network effects anyway.¬†
* Brian Roberts also mentions that Lyft's ""strategy is to win on experience, not price"" while competitive pressure has ""recently receded"". However, it seems highly unlikely that either of these statements are true given that excess driver incentives and customer discounts have been more aggressively put forth by both Uber and Lyft. Additionally, smaller TNCs are able to gain market share or more aptly reworded in the case of ridesharing a shared market, given competitive pricing (see Via).¬†
* Logan Green (CEO) responded to a question inquiring about the performance of specific initiatives toward attracting riders and increasing the number of active riders, especially having done so in Q1 2019 to achieve a new record of active riders which increases each quarter anyway. Logan responded by mentioning the Shared Saver feature which is only live in 3 markets and the first rollouts of the bike and scooter in-app integration, both of which are new and currently limited features that don't relate to the increase in the record number of active riders vaunted on the call.
* Lyft is increasing the number of ESG snippets to contribute to their brand's goodwill in what they think will allow them to differentiate themselves from Uber and maintain loyal riders. Some of these actions have been voluntarily buying carbon offsets to make every ride on the Lyft platform carbon neutral and launching a program where riders who opt in will pay their fares in rounded amounts with the excess being donated to a ""handful of nonprofit\[s\]"". I remain unconvinced that this would curry brand loyalty.¬†

**Notes**

* Release of new product feature ""Shared Saver"" which decreases the price for shared Lyft riders by pairing nearby riders to the same pick-up location
* High-value mode ""Lux"" has grown twice as fast as the rest of the ridesharing modes such as Lyft, Shared, Lyft XL
* Introduction of Lyft Direct which provides a no-fee bank account and debit card where Drivers can instantly access their earnings after each ride and Lyft Driver Centers which offers discount on maintenance, repairs and car washes for Lyft drivers' vehicles
* Since Q1 2017 Lyft Business, Lyft's enterprise segment, increased its share of employee ride-hailing expenses from 9% to 22%
* Expected deployment of Waymo vehicles on the Lyft platform in Q2 2019 and to reach 10 vehicles in Q3
* 300,000 users got rid of their car in the last quarter
* Expect 2019 to peak in terms of pro rated losses
* Reducing insurance costs via mitigating the frequency and severity of accidents
* Investments in telematics to assess speeding and braking, predictive analytics to assess fraudulent claims, transition to a new third-party claims administrator to reduce claims cycle times
* No plans for international expanison
* Each insurance initiative has a different timeline for unlocking benefits
* Gross bookings translation not being shared on a quarterly basis, revenue as a percentage of bookings admitted to have increased QoQ, but will not be disclosed in the future as other segments where revenue equals gross bookings will begin to comprise a larger portion of Lyft's business.¬†
* Waymo vehicles integrated into the Lyft platform in Phoenix with safety driver
* 9 markets with bikes, 15 with scooters, ability to book Citi Bikes within the Lyft app
* Anticipation of locking G&amp;A leverage by FY 2020
* Evident trade off between the quality of matches and pickup times
* Hiring of Anthony Foxx previous Dpt. of Transportation head under Obama to lead policy at Lyft

**CFO Comments on Company Financials on an adjusted basis ($894 million of SBC and payroll tax)**

* Leveraged contribution margin by decreased portion of expenses included in cost of revenue such as insurance required by TNC regulations and transaction processing.
* Increase in O&amp;S as a percentage of revenue (15% to 17% from Q1 2018) driven by investments in bikes, scooters and Express Drive Lyft's weekly driver rental program
* R&amp;D expense 14% of revenue adjusted for $14 million reimbursement from AV co-development partner 16% of revenue
* S&amp;M 29% of revenue down from 42% in Q1 2018
* $3.5 billion in cash
* Revenue run rate of 58%-60% for FY 2019

Office Depot Inc. ODP-5.43% shares sank 7.7% in Thursday trading after the office supply retailer reported a profit and sales decline, raising concerns that Amazon.com Inc. AMZN-0.93% is snapping up market share. On Wednesday, Office Depot reported net income of $8 million, or a penny per share, down from $41 million, or 7 cents per share last year. Adjusted EPS of 7 cents beat the 6-cent FactSet consensus. Sales of $2.77 billion fell from $2.83 billion but beat the FactSet estimate for $2.76 billion. Office Depot said its CompuCom business, which offers technology for digital workspaces, fell short. The company also saw production costs for paper and paper-related products rise. Office Depot was upgraded to hold from strong sell based on valuation at CFRA, but analyst Camilla Yanushevksy expressed concern about the competition. ""We see Amazon's push into one-day shipping luring Office Depot's existing business-to-business customers to Amazon Business Prime and note reputation risks from FTC allegations that Office Depot tricked consumers into buying computer repair services."" CFRA maintained its $2 price target. According to an FTC press release, Office Depot has agreed to pay $25 million as part of the settlement, while a California-based tech support software company is paying $10 million.

The article basically argues that Blue Apron is the worse IPO in recent history.

For those who don‚Äôt know, Blue Apron is a ‚ÄúMeal-kit‚Äù service which delivers ingredients and instructions for cooking 3-5 meals a week to your door.

Here‚Äôs what I see‚Äî
Pros: 
-Annual revenue of $660 million (2018)
-Market cap under $200 million
-Top brand name in an emerging $5 billion+ market
-Consistent gross margin of over 40%
-Are beginning to get operational expenses under control, reducing their operating loss to only $5million for quarter ending Dec31 2018 on $145million revenue.

Cons:
-Declining revenues (this is a BIG one)
-Concerns for future growth in Meal-kit market
-Reports of bad corporate culture and sales tactics
-Declining market share from 40%+ last year to ~35% today.

What first comes to my mind is the old saying ‚Äúbuy when others are fearful‚Äù.  It‚Äôs hard to ignore $600million+ annual revenue and a BEATEN DOWN market cap of just under $200million.  Especially with a gross margin of 40%!  and the most recent quarter a very negligible operating loss. 

I just think that Blue Apron will see revenue growth again soon, either by a new marketing campaign (products, advertising, image), or by organic increase in the Meal-kit market.  And revenue growth will mean a HUGE upside for their stock which has been turned upside-down in a toilet.  

What is everyone‚Äôs thoughts?

I believe we are due for a recession. Below are a few indicators in no particular order.

1) We have had an extremely long bull market. I think we are near the end of the cycle.
2) Valuations across the board are out of whack. 
3) Debt, debt, debt and debt (wtf is going on)
4) Climate change is not a hoax and companies are not prepared for the associated costs.
5) Banks are participating in similar behavior seen in previous recessions.


**My Strategy** 
I‚Äôm currently sitting on cash in a few high interest savings accounts with less than 15% in the market. I‚Äôm waiting on the next recession before entering the market again. I‚Äôm happy with my gains over the past few years and am more than comfortable sitting on cash in this market.

* **Exelon (EXC)**¬†confirmed it is moving forward with closing the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. ¬†Exelon is making the move given that a bill to provide subsidies to keep them open has not moved forward in Pennsylvania‚Äôs legislature. ¬†Exelon confirmed previously announced plans. ¬†The plant will be closed by September 30th of this year. ¬†Exelon is rated ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas

Amazon is basically dominating every industry and doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down in trying to dominate more. It‚Äôs slowly but surely killing stores like Macy‚Äôs and JC Penney and even slowing down the growth of dominant delivery firms like Fedex and UPS. 

And furthermore, it‚Äôs not even trying to make a profits yet. It‚Äôs focused more on earnings growth. There are still many things that they can monetise further like AWS. Once Amazon becomes a habit in people‚Äôs life, they can start charging higher prices and make even more money. Amazon is less like a huge player in the game, and more like the game itself. It‚Äôs literally trying to be every company.

The only stopping AMAZON‚Äôs dominance seems to be the government. 

But why isn‚Äôt everyone stocking up on AMZN? When it‚Äôs obviously going to be the most expensive company soon?

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 for 2018 with an almost 69% gain. Tony Mitchell first bought AMD in October 2014 at $3.45. Today it trades at $26.

While you don‚Äôt often see a great performance like AMD had in 2018 followed by another great performance in the following year, there is a good reason to believe history can repeat itself with AMD.

Intel announced in January 2018 that its processors were vulnerable to attacks called Spectre and Meltdown. Intel initially said Spectre and Meltdown were industry-wide problems implying that AMD had no advantage. That is why it took a while before investors saw through Intel's spin and drive up AMD's price.

Believe it or not, it's happening again. In March, Intel revealed its CPUs were vulnerable to another attack called [Spoiler](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2019/03/05/new-intel-cpu-vulnerability-bodes-well-for-amd/#104b17e47961).

This time around the researchers who discovered Spoiler tested AMD processors and found them to be immune. Consequently, Spoiler will give AMD an advantage over Intel. The question now is how big is AMD's advantage and will it last long enough for them to gain significant market share.

Current float is only 20K with a market cap value of $1.6B.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi team,

I am following on my previous post on $MRS. The water has just started flowing with merger being completed and contract awards being handed out. **In 1 month, we received 10 million dollars worth of contracts.**

**RECENT NEWS**
http://www.mrscorp.com/mission-ready-announces-additional-unifire-award-of-cad1-3-million/
http://www.mrscorp.com/mission-ready-announces-usd7mm-in-new-unifire-awards-provides-guidance-on-post-acquisition-strategy/

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/b19r7d/mrs_mission_ready_solutions_follow_up_35/

**What has changed since the previous post?**

Since the previous post, MRS has closed the Unifire acquisition and is on there way to becoming a multi billion dollar company, thanks for their line of credit that they can tap into and the fact that Unifire was one of the 6 companies to be part of the $4 billion in awards from the Defense Logistics Agency. Unifire has a good reputation with the DLA but hasn't had the ability to generate more contract awards due to their limited capital as it takes time and resources to have the supplies on hand in order to service the DLA. With the backing of a public company and its reputational risk, Unifire was able to secure a line of credit that can go up to 100s of millions of dollars. This would help the company have the supply on hand to service the DLA contracts.

**ADS Inc Tactical Loses their Small Business License**

The big fish ADS Inc was caught with defrauding the government and lying about being a small business in 2016-2017. 2 years later, they;ve lost their business license and the good news is that there is a highly unlikely chance they will receive it again. These are some serious allegations that have taken years to develop. With ADS Inc out of the way, who used to take 90% of the billion dollar contracts, it just means that MRS and Unifire have a chance to obtain more than $100million a year in contracts at a minimum.

They projected second-quarter revenue of $800 million to $810 million. Analysts were expecting $782 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales grew 95 percent to $776 million in the first quarter, beating estimates by $38 million.

Lyft also reported an eye-popping net loss of $1.14 billion in the quarter, which was larger than the company‚Äôs loss for the entire year of 2018. Most of the costs were attributed to stock-based compensation and expenses tied to the initial public offering, but the numbers still unnerved some investors.

Shares are down 18 percent from the March IPO price. On a conference call after the report, Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said 2019 would be the peak year for losses, reiterating what executives said during the IPO roadshow. The report suggests intense competition with Uber Technologies Inc. in the ride-hailing market will continue, at least through the end of the year. Lyft projected a loss before interest, taxes and other expenses of as much as $1.18 billion for 2019. It anticipates sales of $3.28 billion to $3.3 billion for the year, which is above estimates.

For reference, Uber had estimated about $3 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 19 percent from a year before. Today, Uber had enough demand to price its IPO shares at the top of its current range. Uber is expected to price Thursday and begin trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, in what‚Äôs expected to be the biggest U.S. IPO in years. 

In its financial statement, Lyft said active riders climbed 46 percent to 20.5 million. Meanwhile, revenue per active rider increased 34 percent to $37.86. Lyft didn‚Äôt disclose gross bookings this quarter, eliminating one measure investors have used to compare the business to Uber‚Äôs. Lyft had shared an annual number in its IPO filing.

About a year ago, I asked about my stocks from my youth and I got the ""they're probably in a safe, I'll see if I can dig around and find them"" response. Considering the already fragile relationship I have with my parents, I don't want to push them again and risk damaging it further. Would I be able to find any record of these transactions and maybe file an affidavit to recover the stocks? It seems to me that it would be worth it if it's possible.

I would like to consider these initial investments as if they were mid to long term, say 7-20 years.

I've been eyeing the following stocks:

**T**

I like T's dividend, P/B, and current price.  However, I cannot seem to understand why their recent net cash flows are negative with the exception of 2019 Q1.  How can I research the reasons behind stats like this?

**BAC**

I like BAC's PEG ratio, and P/B, but once again am confused by negative net cash flows are negative, and why that is acceptable.  

**GM**

I like GM's ROE, PEG, and dividend but am concerned by their higher D/E.  

&amp;#x200B;

As for ETFs, I honestly have no clue which ones to choose and why.  I understand the basics like how VYM focuses on dividends and many ETFs like VGT follow a certain sector, but how should I choose between, for example, the ETFs which follow SNP? Do I even want an ETF which follows the SNP?

P2P in China : The Darkest Side of China

&amp;#x200B;

MyEmail - [icefocus1@163.com](mailto:icefocus1@163.com)

First of all, Thx for watching. My native language is not English, I'm Chinese, there must be some mistakes in such long content, but I will try my best. Of course, If someone can help, it will be better . I promise the following are completely true. for those who are interested in this and who know the Chinese Language, you can go to the platform sites or portal sites to verify what I said. China's p2p industry is the only industry that can legally fraud.

My purpose is spreading it, cuz I was surprised that I can't find the detailed pertinent information on google or bing.

.thousands of platforms crashed.nearly 10 million people are involved in it, but events are not that simple. I hope there are any mainstream media or Finance media (CNN„ÄÅBBC„ÄÅBloomberg„ÄÅMarketWatch...etc.) release news regarding it, or can anyone contact? I have tried to do this, but it all failed.

For decades, there are numerous non-governmental organizations attracted non-official funds with high yields in China, most of them are Ponzi schemes. but with China's first online P2P platform PPdai established, there are many non-governmental organizations with the purpose of fraud had moved on the internet.there are at least 7000 platforms existed in a few years. according to collapse last year, To be sure,90%+ percent of them are scams.

In recent years, everyone can establish a P2P platform in China if they want to,it's as simple as starting a company.everyone can makes use of Ponzi scheme method(because of bonds are not independent for better experience) to through the early phase,and absconded with the funds or withhold funds(using for offset bad debts or paying interest which is extracted when lending) before investment funds are no longer increasing,all you need to do is disguise it well.

even though a few of them are not fraud platforms,  they also to be experimental platforms, inexperienced.

The P2P industry is viewed as the virtual currency by Chinese gov.once a scam crashes, the victims will be treated as the accomplices.

The demonstration, communicate on communication tools, complaining on the web, all of these are not allowed for social stability. even suicide should also be suicide silently.

Otherwise, you'll be caught on a bus. the QQ Group(likes MSN Group) you stay will be banned.

What is the experience of investing in a scam P2P Platform?

Imagine you're watching ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO, there is a P2P Platform(3 years old) AD at the end of the movie. (or Fintech Board on Amazon...or browsing the web somewhere...etc.)

You are interested in it, you checked the reputation of that platform on several portal sites, it looks fine, apparently, they are advertising everywhere although the ranking is not high.

the platform does not promise that the funds are secured. but there were platforms listed on the stock market in P2P industry, they have been operating safely for several years, from the high rate of return to the current low rate of return since a few years ago.

You finally decided to invest in it, it's a financial product on the platform which automatically invests various independent projects for a fixed term.that makes a lot of lending projects are including it.

Everything is fine. after all, it works like a Ponzi scheme, the bad debts have never been exposed, although the rate of return is high but you think they'll balance it well, otherwise how dare it advertising? (even if the bad debt rate is disclosed, it's fake.)

As time goes by, your investment amount is increasing.but one day, some investors are claiming that they can't get the funds back when financial products are expired.

You asked the customer service department for this.they promised that funds will be paid back after a few days or weeks.

Meanwhile, you have checked the projects that automatically chosen by financial product, these projects have never been released on the platform.

Why does this happen? these projects(matching subprime borrowers, each 1000-4000 CNY only) have a higher NPL(non-performing loans) ratio without a mature automatic risk control system.

There are signs that the quite a few of borrowers have never repaid, which means the investors just participated in an experiment probably, or it's just a scam entirely even if it has been in operation for 3 years.

More than that, tens of millions CNY of investment projects have been found among the projects.which be suspected of investing in real estate, even unfinished deserted building, even the funds have not been invested in real estate.

Soon there are close to all of the projects(under the financial products) are expired, the platform completely withholds recovered funds.in the early phase, you can provide evidence by contact borrowers to force they payback the investment funds, but not lasting long.

The investors call the police, call the economic crime investigator, but without effect. The founder claims that all projects are real.everything is legal.we are collecting debts, you have to wait for it.at the same time, customer service staff are leaving.

After a month, they are forced to develop the creditor's rights transfer system which makes investors be able to purchase or sell creditor's rights. for a platform that unable to cover non-performing loans, in fact, it's platform buying creditor's rights, the investors have to suffer huge losses.

Until now, you discovered that the positive comments regarding the platform are posted by employees they hired. the funds also invest in shareholder's companies. What is this doing? It's too late.

Under normal circumstances, all investments must be returned to investors as much as possible, but for a dead P2P platform in China P2P industry, they have already gained profits when lending. the non-performing loans or bad debts are only left.to continue the business is no longer generate profits. In this case, why not keep the funds of investors to themselves as much as possible in a lawless industry? That's what they think.

Whether lending freely with a purpose of fraudulence or experimental, the beneficiaries of the platform would rather bribe local regulator to maximize profits, and harvesting investors by creditor's rights trading system at a low cost.due to there is no rule stipulate P2P Platform can't lend the funds to borrowers as presents in the law.

Actually, above all of these that's what happened to me.the name of the platform is Èå¢ÁõÜÁ∂≤(Èå¢ÁõÜ = MoneyPot), the founder is Huaqiang Liang(Ê¢ÅËèØÂº∑), and he established a wine cup brand called ""Athena Goddess""(ÈõÖÂÖ∏Â®úÂ•≥Á•û) whose operating on Tmall(belong to Alibaba).

So I am sure this has popped up before but I thought it wouldn¬¥t hurt asking for some input.

In terms of trading strategy, in an overall bull market, why is it a bad idea to buy $100 worth of stocks in each equity that has an ER coming out today and then selling it tomorrow at open? 

Example: lets say there are 150 stocks reporting earnings today. If I buy 100 dollars worth of stocks in each of them, that¬¥s 15000 invested. Considering that the stocks report randomly on ER dates, that basket of 150 stocks will be rather well diversified. Assuming that they all report After bell, one could sell the holdings at open the day after. Rinse and repeat the next day. If we¬¥re in an overall bull-market, shouldn¬¥t this strategy have some merit to it?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I¬¥m pretty sure there are a ton of flaws with said idea. But as a form of mental exercise, why do you think such an idea would be bad? I am currently pulling down some data and playing with excel sheets for the fun of it just to see if there is any value in this but I am curious to hear if any of you have tried something similar and what you¬¥ve found out doing something like this.

**CleanSpark, Inc. (OTCQB: CLSK)**, a microgrid company with advanced engineering, software, and controls for innovative distributed energy resource (DER) and microgrid deployments today announced it has achieved government acceptance of its solar plus storage microgrid located at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.

Camp Pendleton is the major West Coast base of the United States Marine Corps and is one of the largest Marine Corps bases in the US. It is located on the Southern California coast, in San Diego County. Completed by general contractor Bethel-Webcor JV, the Communications Information Systems (C.I.S.) Operations Complex includes a data center, headquarters facility, maintenance and supply warehouse, and related communications infrastructure. The complete project receives backup power from UPS and traditional standby generators provided by other contractors. A subset of the critical loads are served by CleanSpark‚Äôs advanced solar plus storage microgrid offering perpetual off-grid 100% renewable driven energy security through an all iron flow battery DC coupled with solar photovoltaic generation located on both carport shade structures and the buildings‚Äô roofs. CleanSpark was responsible for the optimization, design, engineering, and deployment of the solar plus storage microgrid which shows grid as a backup can be a reality.

Anthony Vastola, SVP of Projects for CleanSpark, said, ‚ÄúThere have been quite a few technology achievements on this project, but what excites me the most is the functional outcome. This is a hybrid Zero Net Energy facility incorporating both off-grid and grid connected renewable generation that works together to support project economics while also providing energy security. With strong system modeling, innovative engineering expertise, and effective microgrid control, we believe economics and energy security should go together.‚Äù   Matthew Schultz, CleanSpark‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer, said, ‚ÄúThis new project builds upon our previous successes at Camp Pendleton including the Critical Power Fractal Grid commissioned in 2014 in partnership with the California Energy Commission.

## Benchmark Announces Year-End 2018 Financial Results

&amp;#x200B;

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - April 29, 2019) - **Benchmark Botanics, Inc. (CSE: BBT) (FSE: BBW) (OTC Pink: BHHKF) (""Benchmark"" or the ""Company""),** a cannabis producer, today released its financial and operational results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

""2018 was a truly pivotal year for Benchmark Botanics. We were issued our License to Import and License to Sell from Health Canada. The Company completed a $2,000,000 Private Placement and entered into a Trademarks License Agreement for use of the ""The Bulldog"" trademark in Canada. In addition, Benchmark signed a definitive agreement for the development of 4 acres of greenhouse operations in Pitt Meadows, BC and strengthened the leadership of the Company with the addition of a high-profile director and a well know industry leader,"" said William Ying, Benchmark Botanics President and CEO. ""With this foundation in place, the Company is transitioning into a period of significant expansion with product sales, facility expansion, additional facilities being constructed, and the Asia Pacific Nutraceutical strategy being implemented. Taken together, we have strengthened our value proposition in 2018, and will be well positioned for the next stage of our growth in 2019.""

**2018 KEY DEVELOPMENTS**

***License to Import***

On July 8, 2018, the Company was issued a License to Import by Health Canada. This import license allows Benchmark, through its 100% owned subsidiary Potanicals Green Growers, access to limitless genetics and strains for production. With this approved permit in hand, in July 2018 Benchmark has executed a purchase order with Dutch Passion from the Netherlands to import over 200 seeds that represent 70 different strains. This will enable Benchmark to custom produce exactly what the off-take markets are asking for. Further to this, the medical profile of the strains we are importing ranges from very high Cannabidiol (CBD) low THC, to high-THC/low-CBD, 1:1 THC: CBD strains, as well as, others. This will position the company to have many options for production when looking to service the current and future market demand.

***License to Sell***

On August 31, 2018, Potanicals was issued a license to sell dried cannabis under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (the ""ACMPR"") by Health Canada.

***Non-Brokered Private Placement***

On September 5, 2018, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement of 2,666,667 units (the ""Units"") at a price of $0.75 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,000,000 (the ""Private Placement"") with an arm's-length party (the ""Investor""). Each Unit is comprised of one common share of the Company (""Shares"") and one common share purchase warrant (""Warrant""). Each Warrant shall be exercisable into one common share at a price of $1.20 for a period of 24 months from the closing date of the Private Placement.

***License of ""The Bulldog"" Trademark***

On September 19, 2018, the Company entered into a Trademarks License Agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Leidseplein Beheer B.V. (the ""Licensor""), a company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, in which the Licensor has agreed to grant the Company use of ""The Bulldog"" trademark in Canada upon the terms and conditions set out in the Agreement.

***Definitive Agreement with 1139000 B.C. Ltd.***

The Company, together with Benchmark's wholly-owned subsidiary, Potanicals, signed a binding definitive agreement on August 30, 2018 (the ""Agreement"") with 1139000 B.C. Ltd. (""1139"") to supersede the letter agreement with 1139 for the development of approximately 4 acres of greenhouse operations to be located in Pitt Meadows, British Columbia (the ""Property"") beneficially owned by 1139.

Under the terms of the Agreement, Benchmark has agreed, through Potanicals, to apply for a license under the ACMPR for the Property, and upon receipt of a license under the ACMPR will earn a 25% interest in 1139, the owner of the Property. Upon the Property being developed to a commercial stage, Benchmark will have the right to increase its ownership to 51% of 1139 in consideration for the issuance of common shares of Benchmark, such number of shares to be based on the then fair market value of 1139.

Pursuant to the Agreement, 1139 is responsible for construction of the necessary facilities on the Property for a license under the ACMPR to be obtained. Benchmark has agreed to indemnify 1139 for certain expenses relating to the acquisition of the Property and construction of the facilities if Potanicals fails to obtain a license under the ACMPR for the Property by June 30, 2019, subject to extension in certain circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say we look at Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), a biotech with three FDA-approved drugs for cystic fibrosis and a market cap of 44.53B. The price of a stock is $173 USD.

Now if a biotech company were to make a drug for cystic fibrosis, and:

1) the drug passes Ph 1, 2, &amp; 3 FDA approval

2) the drug is eventually sold to a large number of the addressable CF market

3) investors, in general, are bullish on the stock.

4) the biotech currently has a market cap of 1.5B and stock price of $8

&amp;#x200B;

Is it conceivable that the stock could rise in value to meet or exceed Vertex's market cap? And if it did, in this hypothetical, would the stock rise from $8/share to $237/share? (made by multiplying by 29.7, which is 44.53/1.5)

Just some quick facts: Amazon had GMV (gross merchandise volume) of 255 billion in 2018. They also had total revenue of $233 billion, 25.7 billion of which was AWS. Ebay, on the other hand, had $11 billion of revenue on ~$90 billion of GMV. As of Friday's close, Amazon had a market cap of $966 billion, Ebay had a market cap of $33.4 billion.

So, AWS had operating income of $7.8 billion. Giving that part of the business a 20 p/e values it at $156 billion, leaving the rest at $810 billion. I know Amazon has a multitude of business units, but I am just going to ignore that for now and say that the e-commerce part of the business trades at 3.17x GMV (810/255), while Ebay trades at .37x GMV (33.4/90). How do people justify this, and how does Amazon get away with booking such a higher percentage of their GMV as revenue? I understand that Amazon take ownership of a lot of the products on their website, allowing them to book revenue more similarly to traditional retailer, but: (1) how high of a percentage could that really be of total revenue, and (2) how much earnings potential do they really have if they are still just resellers, not manufacturers?",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,352371,public,self,Amazon valuation discussion: How do you justify it?,0,1557540252,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bl46jr/amazon_valuation_discussion_how_do_you_justify_it/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am looking to invest more cash in the market given the current negative interest rates in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

My broker allows me to buy fractional shares as well as full shares. So far I have been buying a few stocks (full shares) whenever the opportunity presented itself (i.e: December). Since then I have sat on the side watching the recent bull and couldn't get myself to add more money into the stocks I already owned because they traded way above my average price. I guess it is a psychological thing. It didn't feel right to me to deploy larger cash for each position for a price that would diminish my margin of safety and cash at hand should an opportunity like December presents itself.

So I have been thinking of leveraging the fractional shares approach by investing a monthly sum into a set of positions. Basically doing a DCA rather than a lump sum. The brokerage fees are free but the broker would charge 1.5% of the total investment. For that small amount it would be fine. The downsides are the stocks get bought once a month at Friday's closing price so I can't target a specific price.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is that this would allow me to put in more cash incrementally while having a big of cash on the side to take advantage of dips.

Right now my tax advantaged and taxable accounts are 100% stock market index funds at a 65/35 US/international split. My current investing philosophy is that on my 30+ year time scale stocks will return 6 or 7% above inflation and that buying and holding low cost index funds is my best option. I've recently started looking at leveraged etfs as a way to increase my exposure to short term risk in favor of higher long term returns

I've read a million posts about ""volatility drag"" and ""loss compounding"" and I think they're bullshit. I believe in the long term growth of index funds and that I have a longer time horizon than almost any other investor. I do not believe that I can out-predict the market, and that short term fluctuations are effectively random. I also found a dataset with over a hundred years of monthly S&amp;P returns, so I'll just be showing my work on monthly funds

My long term model for returns is


\[;\\prod\_{i=1}\^{N}(x\_{i} + 1);\]


where N is the number of months I hold for, and \[;x\_{i};\] is a time series with E(\[;x\_{i};\]) &gt; 0 and V(\[;x\_{i};\]) = \[;\\varepsilon\_{i};\]. With a 3x leveraged fund this would become

\[;\\prod\_{i=1}\^{N}(3\*x\_{i} + 1);\]

Now these products are ugly, so I'll take the log before I compute the expected values, leaving me with sums which I can compare individually. I don't think this will break anything because the order of \[;x\_{i};\]s doesn't matter. \[[https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/38296/expected-value-of-a-natural-logarithm](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/38296/expected-value-of-a-natural-logarithm)\](This link) was helpful for finding the expected values 

So now I'm comparing

\[;log(1+E\\\[x\_{i}\])-\\frac{V\[x\_{i}\]}{2\*(1+E\[x\_{i}\])\^{2}};\]

and 

\[;log(1+3E\\\[x\_{i}\])-\\frac{9V\[x\_{i}\]}{2\*(1+3E\[x\_{i}\])\^{2}};\]

and clearly I can plug in historic values for E(\[;x\_{i};\]) and V(\[;x\_{i};\]) to find the leverage that maximizes my expected value.


I also backtested this on rolling intervals with my monthly s&amp;p data and am including the results below. The y axis is annualized returns, the x axis is number of months in the rolling intervals, and the two bands are 1x and 3x leveraged 90% confidence intervals. As you can see, on long time scales leveraged etfs look great.

\[[https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K](https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K)\]([https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K](https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K))


Am I missing something here? Leveraged ETFs seem like a fantastic long term investing option, which is the opposite of what all the articles introducing them say.


I am still working out what I believe the optimal level of leverage is, and how I feel about monthly vs daily re-balancing. If anyone has input/ideas/heuristics I'd love to hear them


Personal context: I'm in my 20s, living in The midwest, and am making \~80k a year. I am maxing out my IRA and 401k, and on pace to save a few thousand more in my taxable account.

-More people seem to use Uber than Lyft.

-Change in top management seems to have improved the company overall. 

-It doesn't only have the ridesharing part, but also food delivery, working on autonomous vehicles, and self-driven trucks for the freight industry. 

Seems like shares may be $44-$50 per unit so investing 1k shouldn't be too bad.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 6th, 2019.

# **Trade talks closing in on finish line as markets weigh inflation data, earnings in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/03/trade-talks-closing-in-on-finish-line-as-markets-weigh-inflation-data-earnings-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; A trade agreement between the U.S. and China could be a strong catalyst for stocks, even though analysts say the market may have already priced in much of the gains.
*****
&gt; Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington for talks in the coming week, and sources have told CNBC a deal is possible by Friday. Trade has been one of the biggest overhangs for the market, but the prospect of successful talks has helped fuel the S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s 17% gain this year.
*****
&gt; Besides trade in the coming week, investors are awaiting Friday‚Äôs inflation data, important after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs comment Wednesday that weak inflation is transitory, signaling the Fed does not now have to consider an interest rate cut.
*****
&gt; That comment from the Fed chief sent markets reeling, since many investors have been positioning in both bonds and stocks for a pre-emptive interest rate cut from the Fed. So Friday‚Äôs consumer price index will be key, even though unlike the inflation measure the Fed watches, CPI is expected to show inflation running slightly above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target in April. The Fed‚Äôs favored PCE deflator had core inflation at 1.6% in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; To close out this week, the April jobs report crushed Wall Street‚Äôs expectations‚Äî adding a robust 263,000 new hires while the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, the lowest level in a generation, the Labor Department said Friday. Wall Street had been expecting 190,000 hires and a 3.8% jobless rate.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe more robust the incoming data is, the more time the Fed has to sit and watch and evaluate whether inflation is rising this year in the manner that they think it is. If the labor market is good enough, it allows the Fed to be patient, and let this thing play out,‚Äù said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. Gapen said if the data and inflation is instead weakening, the Fed would have to rethink its position later in the year.
*****
&gt; Disney earnings
&gt; Earnings will continue to be a factor in the week ahead, with about 50 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including media names like Disney, News Corp and Viacom.
*****
&gt; But if the trade negotiations are resolved, that will be the event that could have ramifications for markets and the economy for months to come.
*****
&gt; But the reaction in the stock market may initially seem short-lived. ‚ÄúIf the tariffs come off, you might get some readjustment to earnings expectations. So, you might have a nice couple of days, but I think it‚Äôs three-quarters of the way priced in, maybe a little bit more,‚Äù said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC.
*****
&gt; She said some sectors have already benefited from the prospects of a deal. ‚ÄúThe two I think are in focus are industrials and semis,‚Äù she said. As for semiconductors, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs been such a fierce rally in that space this year. Semis were sort of the pure play on the China fears and they rallied hard and fast. They‚Äôre starting to see some profit-taking.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF is up 33.4% year-to-date.
*****
&gt; Calvasina said the better-than-expected performance in S&amp;P 500 first quarter earnings shows there will not be the earnings recession expected just a month ago. She said companies focused a lot on cost cutting to maintain their margins. According to Refinitiv, the S&amp;P 500 companies are now expected to see profit growth of about 0.7%, compared to expectations for a contraction of 2% back on April 1.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the market very much deserves the rally we‚Äôve had,‚Äù she said. However, she sees limited upside and maintains a target of 2,950 on the S&amp;P for year end. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting to the part of the year where we‚Äôre vulnerable to bad news. It doesn‚Äôt mean today is the top, but when we think about where we‚Äôre going to be at year end, it‚Äôs a good reason not to raise the target. We feel like we can overshoot in in the short term.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably a good time to take money off the table. We‚Äôve said that things could weigh on the market in the second half,‚Äù she said.
*****
&gt; Investors are also looking towards Omaha this weekend. Berkshire Hathaway was holding its annual meeting this Saturday, and that could generate plenty of headlines for investors who are Warren Buffett watchers.

# Strong Starts Hog Gains for the Year

&gt; Big gains the first four months of 2019 have some Wall Street pundits and analysts concerned. While strong starts for the market for the first four months of the year don‚Äôt leave much for the rest of the year, it is by no means a negative implication or bearish indication. S&amp;P 500 leads the pack with its 17.5% gain coming in at #3 since 1950. NASDAQ‚Äôs 22.0% gain is the 5th best first four month since 1971. DJIA‚Äôs 14.0% rise is number 9.

&gt; In the tables below we have displayed the top 20 first four month gains for the three major U.S. market indices with the subsequent changes for May, Rest of the Year, ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù May-October, 2nd half July-December and full year performance. While most of the full year gains are clearly logged in these big first-four-month gains, there still upside to be had in the latter part of the year.

&gt; As you might expect May is weakest for DJIA and S&amp;P and the Worst Six Months are hit hardest mostly after the strongest starts. The major blemish is course in 1987, with other critical givebacks in 1971and 2011. Other significant issues arose in 1975, 1983, 1986 and1998. Basically, if you take 1987 out of the equation the rest of the year after strong starts aint so bad. Average gains are about equal to historical average annual gains. Rest of the year gains sans 1987: DJIA 7.3%, S&amp;P 500 8.7%, NASDAQ 12.6%.

# Typical May Trading: Just a Couple of Positive Areas

&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear ‚ÄúSell in May.‚Äù But when exactly in May is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May‚Äôs eighteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# The Power of Productivity

&gt; The U.S. labor market may be kicking the economic expansion into another gear.

&gt; Consistent productivity growth has been largely absent from the expansion, even as payrolls and wages have grown at a healthy clip. However, strong labor market trends and last year‚Äôs pickup in capital expenditures growth could be sparking a resurgence in productivity, which we think could be key to future economic growth.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, productivity in the first quarter rose at the fastest year-over-year pace since 2010.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Power-of-Productivity.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Increased business spending is the primary catalyst for higher productivity, as better equipment and training boosts output per worker, although a tightening labor market has also helped. Labor shortages and accelerating wage growth normally incentivize companies to invest in boosting output with current labor. In turn, workers may get paid more as output increases, which could flow through to higher consumer spending.

&gt; Growing productivity also helps offset rising labor expenses, as companies get more output per dollar spent, which can help mitigate inflationary pressures and support healthy profit margins for U.S. companies. First quarter unit labor costs rose only 0.1% year over year, the slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2013.

&gt; ‚ÄúLabor market strength has been a pillar of the expansion,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúJob creation and wage growth remain healthy, and increased productivity points to stronger output without significantly higher costs.‚Äù

&gt; The April jobs report, released May 3, showed U.S. hiring hasn‚Äôt wavered amid global uncertainty and trade tensions. Nonfarm payrolls rose 263K, higher than estimates for a 190K gain. Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year, around the fastest pace of the cycle, and at a level that should continue to bolster consumer confidence and support consumer spending. The unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, a cycle low.

# More (Im)patience

&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed) has promised patience, but financial markets now want more.

&gt; On Wednesday, Fed members unanimously voted to keep rates unchanged, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated several times in his May 1 post-meeting press conference that further patience is appropriate. That patience, which soothed stocks earlier this year, spurred nearly a 1% intraday selloff in the S&amp;P 500 Index.

&gt; Investors have pointed to slowing consumer inflation as a case for lower rates, and bond markets have increasingly positioned for a rate cut. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, has slowed in the first three months of this year, falling as the global economy has struggled with trade uncertainty.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Consumer-Inflation-Trailing-Away-from-Federal-reserve-Target.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While the pace of core PCE growth isn‚Äôt alarmingly slow, the downward trend over the past three months runs counter to the Fed‚Äôs intentions.

&gt; Still, Powell attributed lower inflation to transitory factors. He also correctly noted that core PCE growth stayed close to 2% for much of 2018, so fundamentals before the first quarter volatility supported the Fed‚Äôs inflation target. Producer prices and wages have steadily risen over the past few months, and we expect businesses to eventually adjust their prices accordingly as demand picks up.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe think the trend of slowing consumer price growth is temporary and that inflation could pop higher as pricing pressures build,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúIf consumer price growth picks up, we think there is a better chance of a rate hike later this year, rather than a cut.‚Äù

&gt; Other parts of the U.S. economy are rebounding, so we don‚Äôt see a strong argument for a rate cut right now. At the very least, Powell made it clear that the Fed doesn‚Äôt have enough clarity to move policy in either direction, which is prudent given the persistent mixed signals in some data series. For now, the Fed remains in wait-and-see mode as trends settle and growth stabilizes.

# Time to Sell in May? Part Deux

&gt; As we noted earlier this week, these next six months historically have been the worst for stocks. That is why there‚Äôs a well-known investment axiom to ‚ÄúSell in May and Go Away.‚Äù

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Next-Six-Months-Have-Been-the-Worst-on-Average.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; However, that popular principle hasn‚Äôt rung true for most of this bull market.

&gt; ‚ÄúStocks have actually risen over this dreaded six-month stretch in six of the past seven years, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained in May six consecutive years,‚Äù explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúBlindly going to cash and waiting until after Halloween to re-invest hasn‚Äôt been the most profitable strategy lately.‚Äù

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has bucked the seasonal trend recently, but we think a decisive midyear rally could be more difficult to come by this year. With the S&amp;P 500 higher each of the first four months of 2019 and up more than 17.5% for the year (as of April 30), we think a consolidation or pullback could be warranted. As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, over the past 20 years stocks have spent the next several months in a sideways grind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Next-6-Months-Could-Be-Choppy-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The average peak-to-trough correction during these worst six months is 11.1%. With conditions quite stretched near term, stocks could be vulnerable to a potential pullback over the coming months.

The ironic thing about Tesla raising capital is that it will add conviction to both longs and shorts. Tesla is a highly emotional stock, with a long line of doubters and believers who couldn't be further from each other when it comes to their opinions of the stock.

Bulls will believe that the capital raise is a big benefit, easing worries over Tesla's cash position and making sure the company has the funds it needs to fuel its growth.

I'm also looking for funds that lean large cap, as I have reason to believe a recession's going to happen soon, and I've read that large caps react less strongly.

Two funds that have made it to my final pool of consideration are FIVA (Fidelity International Value Factor ETF) and FZILX (Fidelity ZERO International Index Fund).   According to Morningstar's profiles of the funds, FIVA leans more large cap and value, and will probably be more tax-friendly as an ETF.  FZILX, OTOH, is among Fidelity's new offerings that has a zero expense ratio, as opposed to FIVA's 0.39%.  

What else should I consider to push one fund higher than the other for consideration?  And also for sifting through other similar funds that may come up in my research.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

So we good. DOJ said if a rule hit Qualcomm hard it would harm competition because only few left with 5g in other countries. And ofc from a national security point for the USA. The apple Settlement also put a damper on FTC case. Qualcomm will fly high when FTC settle/dismis.

""(T)here is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology,"" the Justice Department wrote. ""Such an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition.""

I am from VietNam and I have been working in US on J1 visa for 18 months now. Back in Mar 2019, I opened a brokerage account with Wells Fargo and started trading stocks (buying mostly). About a month later, without any notification, Wells Fargo has put a restriction of my brokerage account and right now I am unable to transfer money in and out of my brokerage account or trading stock. I was told from the Wells Fargo Advisory officer that I need to provide them my US green card before they can lift the account restriction. I asked them the evidence for such regulations and they said it is the Fed. laws. I think this is bull-shit because:

1. I have known someone similar to my immigration status and they are able to trade stocks and pay tax, so it should not be Fed. law.

2. If that was the case, then why did they allow me to open the account in the first place? and after I have put a lot of my saving into stocks they banned it?. For clarification, I did provide them my visa/passport, Driver license and SSN, and I also asked them if a foreigner legally working in USA (with SSN) can trade stock and they said I was ok.

I would be very much appreciated for any suggestions/advices on how to move forward with this.

An article from Business Insider called ''The world is running out of sand ‚Äî and there's a black market for it now'', written by Rob Ludacer and published Jun. 11 2018 explains how sand, the worlds' third most used resource behind air and water, is running out. Desert sand is (despite popular belief apparently) not usable in things like concrete and most sand that we use in concrete and such is sand produced by rivers - which we consume at twice the rate the world's rivers can produce it.

I planned on starting with one of the free trading apps. I've never traded stock before, however  I've saved up several thousand dollars from a good job I started last year and want to start investing it. I have a 401k with Vanguard *(my only exposure to stocks in any way)* and would like to try my hand at buying stocks on my own. This is money I put aside for this purpose.

I want to research and learn about investing so I won't be emotional about it. I'm trying to avoid getting sucked into FOMO *(Fear Of Missing Out)*.  I'm open to any resources/links that you guys would think are helpful.  Of course personal experience of what you learned and a smart way to start off would be appreciated.

Mainly I think I need to understand:

* What to look for when choosing a stock
* The basic terms that are important to understand
* What schemes to avoid
* What sources to read to learn about specific stocks
* Anything else that I'm too new to know is important
