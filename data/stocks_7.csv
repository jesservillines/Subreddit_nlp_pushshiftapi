Analysts at the investment bank see prices pushing to $1,600 an ounce next year. The price of gold currently sits at $1459.62. That is a nearly 10% gain from present day prices. December gold futures are trading at about $1,456.70 an ounce.

On Sunday, the investment bank stated in a report that it likes the precious metal for 2020, because investors are looking for alternative investment assets.

“Investment deficit creates excess savings, supporting gold. In theory, savings should equal investment, but due to this decline in capex and a rise in precautionary cash balances, a savings surplus is beginning to develop that is supporting gold prices,” the analysts wrote. “When combined with 750 tonnes of central bank gold purchases related to de-dollarization and defensive portfolio rotations, the savings glut means we maintain our bullish gold stance in 2020 with a target of $1600/toz..”

The investment bank’s analysts believe that heightened global uncertainty, along with slowing economic growth, could support gold prices. Recession concerns remain, moreover, according to the analysts. Increasing inflation, as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low, could buoy gold prices. A potential flight from the dollar could also help support the gold price.

Goldman Sachs is less bullish on silver for 2020. The investment bank does see prices increasing to $18 an ounce, a gain of 6.5% over current prices.

“Outside of investment demand, silver fundamentals remain challenged as industrial demand contracted and mine supply, while flat this year, is expected to grow strongly in 2020,” the analysts said. “While we expect investor interest in the precious space to be high in 2020 it will likely be less than during 2H19 when recession fears spiked. In such an environment while gold investment can continue to grow silver often gets overlooked being the marginal precious metal.”

Annual sales of this segment in the US have been growing consistently in the high-single, low-double-digit % range since 2011 or so. This is being driven by the [rising popularity](https://boatingindustry.com/top-stories/2018/02/26/everybodys-gone-surfin/) of wakesurfing/wakeboarding activities among millennials.

Malibu have achieved a phenomenal recovery since the 2009 recession, led by CEO Jack Springer, with EPS and revenue still growing by ~30-40% YOY today. Their performance is eclipsing competitors in the US market, and still has significant expansion potential into new international markets. The company owns a number of patents, and licenses some of its tech to other manufacturers as well. It is a highly profitable company, with a sound balance sheet and huge growth potential.

""This Is How Google Will Collapse"" was an extremely popular article written in 2017, that goes into quite a bit of detail and in depth analysis on how/why Google would ultimately fail as a company. 

It's interesting to see now in the present day, just how wrong the author turned out to be in his predictions as a whole given that, at the time, it garnered such a great deal of popularity when it was posted.

***A personal take / some potential reasoning for why things ended up this way:***

\- People largely underestimated how diversified Google has become.

\- Dismissing YouTube as unprofitable seems laughable, big media companies are probably kicking themselves for not trying a similar concept earlier. That’s the kind of business where an eventual single digit profit margin will make you tremendously wealthy.

\- Google Maps is another example of an ad driver that’s not easily replaced by a competitor. Only giants like Apple and Microsoft can compete on that product.

\- G Suite has made major inroads in the lucrative enterprise productivity space.

\- Google is also slowly building a devices business, and all you have to do is take a peek at Apple to know how successful that can be.

\- Google has the #1 web browser with growing market share to alarming Internet Explorer levels with its search engine and tools set as the defaults. Comparisons to Microsoft’s fall from grace assume history will be repeated, but unlike IE6, nobody’s making a faster/noticeably better to the end user browser than Chrome.

\- As far as the search ads itself, I don’t know that the article makes a compelling case that users simply don’t use search engines or the general Internet anymore. The current trend of ad blocking is that they are getting less and less effective. I’m sure Amazon and Facebook have taken a slice of that advertising pie but it seems unrealistic to expect them to take the whole thing.

\- Not only that but Google’s ad platform allows website owners to place ads directly on sites, so an external link on Facebook can take a user right back into Google’s revenue space.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,442507,public,self,This Is How Google Will Collapse,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/e2ibuj/this_is_how_google_will_collapse/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'CMtsnnM0DoT7K6kFlOFf5buc-NF96m0zy1TVOVYvVpc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 68, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/lwu03luKfaHyjuBSkgaP9OoqV2O-hyV-Kkk91yTwYgk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22a5aae12f57106e1039ee3355b65ec75481f781', 'width': 108}, {'height': 136, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/lwu03luKfaHyjuBSkgaP9OoqV2O-hyV-Kkk91yTwYgk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2440f29f5fd2683712400511a7b2ed2e074b2e72', 'width': 216}, {'height': 202, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/lwu03luKfaHyjuBSkgaP9OoqV2O-hyV-Kkk91yTwYgk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a437a9acf504f4974fb68459072b90879da606e6', 'width': 320}, {'height': 404, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/lwu03luKfaHyjuBSkgaP9OoqV2O-hyV-Kkk91yTwYgk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4304a10692b138a3d2a2628005b50ae3f940c1a', 'width': 640}, {'height': 606, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/lwu03luKfaHyjuBSkgaP9OoqV2O-hyV-Kkk91yTwYgk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a9623b982607919beaa5dc1cd5fae78177de08d', 'width': 960}, {'height': 682, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/lwu03luKfaHyjuBSkgaP9OoqV2O-hyV-Kkk91yTwYgk.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5238740327fe838856e5f23b50781ae79629071f', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 758, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/lwu03luKfaHyjuBSkgaP9OoqV2O-hyV-Kkk91yTwYgk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3f3850290f1a6ea9e3d3bc1c35ec00e7d5291907', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,

I posted about this a week ago...  I'm reposting, because my questions weren't fully answered. 

My question is this: how does the merger between WCG (Wellcare) and Centene work for stock holders?  Put another way: what are the mechanics of how the merger works for stockholders in one or both of the companies?  Do my WCG stocks turn into Centene stocks? Do I get a buyout? Or do both stocks continue on as before?  

Here's the info about the merger:

I invested in WCG about a year ago, and the stock is now up about 60%. Can someone explain what the implication is for someone like me, who's only holding about 10K worth of WCG stocks? Is the merger meaningful to me? What exactly happens if the merger is approved?

This is something I don't fully understand and I'd like to understand better.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, let's say I invest through an online broker. They're reasonably trusted, have a very nice platform, so on. Say I throw $5,000 into the BigGroupCollective (BGC) index and, for some reason, one day the stock broker just -stops-. The reason doesn't matter, but one day I just can't use the online broker any more.

&amp;#x200B;

In that situation, what happens to my stocks? Are the stocks still technically in my name and I just need to sign up with another broker, prove (somehow) that I have 1000 BGC stocks, and get right back to staring at graphs? Do I lose the stocks and somehow get paid back in insurance of some sort? What are the legalities here?

&amp;#x200B;

The same question applies to a real, in-person broker. What if the company just closes up shop one day? Am I SOL and now need to farm cow poo for my weekly frozen dinner?

The price declined sharply below and made a brutal downtrend to most of the crypto projects. However, just before that changes, a lot of traders and analysts were busy drawing falling wedges on the BTC/USD chart. Some were warned against this and stated clearly how these price changes will be invalidated and broken to the downside. It happened and the price fell through it. Now that the price has finally begun a downtrend, how low could it go and is it a good time to short the market?  

Significantly, volatility in cryptocurrency means different things to different people in the markets. It all depends on a person’s tolerance for risk. A risk-averse individual would avoid high-volatility investments since they are more concerned about stability and preserving their wealth. Those who participate in the cryptocurrency market are considered to be risk-takers.

A bullish market is characterized by a rising movement and investor confidence. In regards to trading, a trap is a sudden change of direction during an existing trend. In the case of a bull trap, this means that during a period of falling prices in a bearish period, the market abruptly changes direction and begins to move bullishly. Meanwhile, bear traps can prompt a market participant to expect a decline in the value of a financial instrument, indicating the execution of a short position on the asset. However, the value of the asset stays flat or rallies in this scenario, and the participant is forced to incur a loss.  

Still, trading the bull and bear trap patterns are a good way to make profits immediately instead of having to keep trades open over long periods. Understanding bear and bull traps is just one step on a long journey, to a successful trading career, these phenomena are essential for every trader to comprehend.

For the past few years Target grew almost a cult following among millennials. While Walmart has become synonymous with trashy and cheap, stores like IKEA and Target are known to sell nicer, fashionable home goods and clothing still at a cheaper price than high end stores. As my generation has come into their late 20s (and started earning real paychecks) I think this has had a real effect. Seriously I have friends who only shop at target for furniture and for certain clothing items. Target's management and focus on improving their digital, delivery, and return policies has obviously done the rest and their stock is benefiting massively.  
  
Another example is that millennials drug habits are vastly different from boomers. They tend to not be brand loyal to a particular cheap beer, and in general consume more wine, liquor, and marijuana. Big beer companies that don't adapt will face big problems as their loyal customers die off.

Often it is said that time in the market is better than trying to time the market. But, is this only a relative concept? For example, let’s take TSLA which is sitting around it’s all time high right now. It does not pay a dividend. Certainly, it will drop below it’s all time high some time in the future - what benefit do I have in investing now rather than later at some point when it will probably be cheaper?

Is this time in the market thing more about dividend payers where you would have made the difference in dividends if you happened to buy in the dip?

Confused - some help would be appreciated!

I expect to reach about 36,500 in dividends in 2019 and up to about 40,000 dkk in 2020 (which corresponds to about 3 months consumption in dividend tax).

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

My question about GLD and GLDM  isn’t so much as if it’s worth investing in either or which is better per se. I was wondering what is the difference? My understanding is that both are state street bank gold shares, that merely attempt to track gold pricing. One is just “mini” hence the ‘M’ correct? The charts appear to line up identically, with GLDM appearing to be 1/10 cost of GLD. If I’m correct so far, this is where my confusion arises. If they operate the same (in my mind like BRKA and BRKB) why do they have different net expense ratios on yahoo finance? GLD is listed as 0.4% and GLDM is 0.18%.

Technology, Fashion, Food, Energy and Transportation. 

You can use the left over money any way you want. Mutual funds are an option however buying on margin is not. You can only buy and sell stocks and mutual funds. No options or puts. I do not think penny stocks are an option. The time period is 3 weeks and you can trade any way you want during the time period. (You can sell stocks you bought and buy other stocks before time is up) Person with the highest money wins (in this case, most likely the person with the most remaining money)

I’m 18 from Europe. I wanted to get into trading for a long time and I started in June 2019. I tried to make an account on known platforms like RobinHood or Thinkorswim not knowing they are US platforms and you can’t trade (or it’s not as easy) on them from the EU. Next I downloaded Plus500. I read many articles and watched many videos about it on YouTube which are mostly from 4-5 years ago. In social media it seems like a dead platform. Even 
its subreddit is dead. It seems like the platform has a lot of haters. Comments on YouTube from the old videos are mostly about it being a scam. Of course I know it isn’t true, if it was it wouldn’t exist now. 
Now let me tell You about me. I downloaded Plus500 in July. I connected with Google and stared trading with £40.000. Unexpectedly the first trades I made were good. Of course they were just guesses but that only made me believe more. I found most succes in trading oil and gold. I’m not sure but I feel like they are considered “noob stocks?”. Is that true? Even if they are, money is money, right? Except commodities I traded few popular stocks like Tesla or Apple. 
So I kept making big profit, making my equity above 200% of the demo account starting money. Sometimes, mainly after gold crushes I also made big losses but never as much to get below my £40.000. I finally understood all rules of the platform (as far as I know now). I know what you are probably thinking by now (haha). “Does this guy really think this is so easy? Making crazy 100% profit in few weeks or months with a crazy amount of money he will never be able to invest?” Yes, I know it’s harder to invest with... let’s say £400 than it is with £40.000 (at leats most people say it is). I agree but not all the way. I kept saying that it’s all simple maths. The only thing that is different is the amount of money you earn/lose and the %s are really the same. I made a second account, lowered my equity to about £250 (I’d do even more but I already knew that going under 200 will reset the account. Guess what? I made profit, close to the one on my first account measuring by % I earn with each trade. 

So now what is my question? What is your opinion on Plus500 people from Europe? Is it worth investing? Personally I really like the commissions and I think it’s possible to make money on it. Do you have any advice what I should focus on and what to avoid?

Sorry if some of my sentences are incorrect or hard to understand. As you can see I’m quite new to all this good stuff.

I am more leaning to invest in CBS because it seems to me a more powerful company. 

CBS has a nice 12.68% for last 10y EPS CAGR and is expected to grow almost 10% in the near future. 

The stock is almost hitting rock bottom because the only time it traded at a lower PE was in the recession of 2008. Historically their normal P/E is around 15.  
The merger is supposed to happen until the end of 2019 and if it fails, the CBS stock could lower even more but not so much. On the other hand, the upside is huge comparing with the downside. If the merger happens, as it expected to, and if the stock reach it's normal P/E of 15, we are talking about a growth between 100% and 150% in the next two or three years. 

Revenue have been growing at a pace of 6.5% CAGR for the last 10 years and 9.2% for the past 5 years.

The only think that concerns me is the debt level that increased 21% for the past 5 years.

However, CBS fundamentals looks solid and I think their current value doesn't match the value of the business.

I stumbled on warrior. Now spending an extra $200 a month was kind of ridiculous, seeing as I've only made a few trades since following tim. I've been treating it like school where you get educated, get a degree, then work.

Since joining the warrior room last month, I've made a few successful trades and a few unsuccessful ones. Unfortunately, they didn't pan out like I expected. My emotions got the best of me, and I ended up losing on them. Circling back to warrior, he calls out his positions live, which is useful to see what his though process is and emulate it. I'm never quick enough to get my orders in. By the time I hear the call, I'm not able to fill the order fast enough. I usually use a market order, which allows a trader to get a quicker order. I've been reluctant to use stop orders.

Now, my question to you all is this, since tim and warrior have different trading methods, which is the more profitable one long-term. Meaning which can make me serious cash quicker.

Hello any help is appreciated on my post. I bought 2c for $JPM expiring on 11/29. I expected this contract to already be at my break even price. I have been eyeballing contracts for this bank for some time now. I decided to purchase this contract when the price was around 129.00. Price ranges since I have purchased this contract are from 129 and some change to 131.11. I expected the price to stop around 131 yesterday, but JPM seems to me it will continue to range in these new prices all next week never hitting my breakeven price of 131.70. What do you think the price will be at JPM next week? Another thing I need help with is my limit prices on my contracts. When they are high everyone continues to ride the uptrend on stocks not selling it for the profit for example limit price average stock is currently ranging from .18 to .25 if the price is rising around this price I would try and purchase each contract for .20 cents. My limit order does not go through, the price of the stock and limit price keep going up. I leave my order to see if it will possibly lower and pass it again. This time everyone sees that the uptrend they have been profiting big from since around .18 to .25 is crashing. Now lets say the price starts to lower quickly at .40. These people that denied my first contract will ride the downtrend until it passes my price of .20. Then sell it for the low high (myprice), when it is not averaging at .10 to .17. Ofcourse I wasn’t watching when this happened or else I would have changed my price. I also expected enough people to sell for profits while it is going up, that way the average limit price can lower to my limit price range, and hopefully keep rising after that. This was not the case with my contract at all. Thanks any help is appreciated.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.
*****
&gt; Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.
*****
&gt; While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.
*****
&gt; As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
*****
&gt; Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.
*****
&gt; The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.
*****
&gt; A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.
*****
&gt; In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.
*****
&gt; Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.
*****
&gt; But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.
*****
&gt; “Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”

&gt; She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.

&gt; “I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.

&gt; # Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher
&gt; The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.
*****
&gt; “This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”
*****
&gt; Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..
*****
&gt; “There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”
*****
&gt; Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.

# Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020

&gt; Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.

&gt; Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.

# Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers

&gt; December is now the number two S&amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.

&gt; In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.

&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.

# Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days

&gt; We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.

&gt; There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.

&gt; For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.

# Don’t Fear Record Highs

&gt; “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.

&gt; It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.

&gt; Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.

&gt; “Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”

# STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle

&gt; With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/trump-vs-cycle-table.png))**

&gt; Below we show the S&amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump's second year, the S&amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.

# Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it's important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs.png))**

&gt; Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It's not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That's a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!

&gt; While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.

# What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don't?

&gt; In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there's one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term ""strong consumer"" on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there's still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term ""strong consumer"" in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112119-Strong-Consumer.png))**

&gt; So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald's (MCD) are the sector's largest components. Does the market know something we don't?

**TJX** and **Target** both reported excellent results. However, it was not a good week in general for retail with **Macy’s** reporting a 3.5% drop in same store sales and a data breach. **Kohls** dropped 20% after reporting a miss, cutting guidance and pointing to an “increasingly competitive promotional environment”. 

**Home Depot** results were mixed and the stock price also dropped 10%. A little harsh perhaps after what was a narrow miss and considering comps were still up a very respectable 3.5%. A number of analysts followed the sell off with reassuring comments that the market for home improvement products remained strong with improving home affordability, lower interest rates, aging baby boomers spending money on remodelling and millennials entering the housing market.

Elsewhere, **Snapchat** announced it will be fact-checking all political advertising in a move that offers a middle ground between Facebook and Twitter and may help it take a larger share of political advertising budgets ahead of the 2020 elections. Advertisers will be keen to use Snapchat’s platform which remains highly popular among younger demographics (which are seeing significant increases in voter turnout). With the total spend on political advertising in 2020 estimated at $10 billion even a small share could provide a meaningful boost to Snapchat (TTM revenues $1.54 billion) over the next year.

The man credited with bringing **T-Mobile** back from the dead, CEO John Legere, announced he was moving on and was to be replaced by COO Mike Sievert. The market took the news in its stride, reassured by announcements that there would be no change in strategy and realising perhaps that the time had come for a more conventional approach. Nevertheless Mr Sievert has some big shoes to fill.

**PayPal** said it was putting part of its cash pile to use with a transformative $4 billion acquisition of, discount-finding tool, Honey Science. The stock fell 1.5% but the news was well received by analysts who said it should drive engagement and develop a deeper relationship with consumers and merchants.

Bad news for **Slack Technologies** as a blog post this week by Microsoft Corporation revealed its Microsoft “Teams” service now has more than 20 million users. Teams seems to be gaining momentum, which is clearly a negative for Slack. The latest numbers suggest Teams added 7 million new daily active users in the past five months compared to adding just 1 million new daily active users in the previous 10 months.

Finally the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) released data on Monday, showing a 12% year-over-year declines in appliance shipments. That sounds like bad news for appliance makers such as **Whirlpool** but, as of Friday, the stock was little changed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks (Fluent Inc)**

**Fluent Inc** jumped 20% after management sent a strong signal to the market. However I think it could go significantly higher. 

The company operates in a fast growing, fast changing and competitive sector - digital marketing. It has built up a huge database of (150 million+) that it can target on behalf of clients. It uses competitions to get details and, importantly, gets consent from clients to contact them.  A former CEO has said that if European data protection laws were introduced in the US it would give Fluent a huge advantage as it (largely) already has consent. Indeed Europe offers a huge potential market for Fluent which has already reportedly started testing in the UK.

However Fluent's stock has not had a good year. The data driven digital marketer is down 75% (with a valuation of 0.5x sales and 0.6x book) from highs after reducing guidance, not once but twice. That by itself is an issue as it suggests that, not only is there a problem but, management dont understand how bad it is.

The overall change in guidance was actually not that bad (not something that suggests a 75% SP drop is required). Full year sales are still forecast to rise 6.4% although EBITDA will drop 34%. Q3 and Q4 numbers are down on 2018 but Q4 still reveals an annualised EBITDA of $20m which compares favorably to the current market cap of $130 million.

I think there is more upside potential. Management have been clear throughout that the outlook for the core advertising platform is very good. The drop in revenues and rising costs are due to the company exiting peripheral ventures that have been explored and not met revenue/return targets (as well as a couple of bad debts deemed unrecoverable). They said they did experience some softness at the core for approximately 60 days, spanning mid-August to mid-October. On the November 11 conference call CEO Ryan Schulke said ""Since mid-October, we have regained our traction and to date, we've seen trending improve from top-line revenue and media margin perspective.""

That has been supported by Tuesdays share buy back announcement with Schulke saying “This stock repurchase program reflects the continued confidence we have in the fundamentals and long-term prospects of our business, further supported by improvements we have seen in our core commercial trending following a challenging third quarter,”

Management clearly want to send out a signal that the core business is improving again and the SP jump of 20% is a good start but it is still down 30% on a week ago and 75% on April highs. (as mentioned above the annualised EBITDA of $20m compares favorably to the current market cap of $130 million)

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Target)** 

**Target** reported excellent results as it appears customers warm to the concept of same day pick up from a Target store. More hassle in some ways but it eliminates a load of cardboard boxes that would have to be recycled. Third-quarter results shot past guidance as store traffic and sales growth accelerated. Revenue grew 4.7% to $18.7 billion, beating analyst expectations of $18.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share rose 25% to $1.36 after the company had forecast EPS between $1.04 and $1.24 three months ago. Stock ended the week up 24%. 25% EPS growth compares favorably to the 20x 2019 PE.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highly Speculative Pharmaceuticals (Karuna, Myovant and Hepion)**

**Karuna Therapeutics** jumped 440% on Monday after reporting a very positive mid-stage clinical trial for its lead candidate, KarXT, for the treatment of acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia

Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D., professor and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons and a member of Karuna’s scientific advisory board said “The results of the Phase 2 trial are impressive and encouraging because they indicate that KarXT, if approved, could represent a game-changing therapeutic advance in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia,”

He added. “The effectiveness of antipsychotics has been limited by the frequent and serious side effects of first- and second-generation drugs which are difficult for many patients to tolerate, are potentially harmful, and lead to high rates of discontinuation and relapse. In addition to its novel mechanism of action, KarXT could be a new therapeutic option that has the potential to offer robust efficacy devoid of weight gain, metabolic effects and extrapyramidal *{involuntary movement}* side effects.” 

The second point is important as KarXT antipsychotic drugs are notorious for negative side effects that often cause patients to discontinue use of the drugs. Karuna reported that discontinuation rates in the study were similar between patients receiving KarXT and those receiving placebo. The company said that there was ""no evidence of somnolence *{drowsiness}*, extrapyramidal side effects or weight gain relative to placebo"" -- all of which are common worrisome side effects of current antipsychotic drugs.

The company also said it planned to explore other CNS disorders that could benefit from the treatment, such as psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease as well as the management of pain

Back of the envelope, I would consider the probability of approval has increased from about 20% to 40% and that the lack of side effects should make it possible for the company to take a 40% share in a $10 billion market. 30% margins with forward PE of 14 seems reasonable.

That would yield a valuation of $6.7 billion (40% x 40% x $10 billion x 30% x 14 = $6.72 billion) compared to yesterday’s close at $1.99 billion. That looks attractive even before considering potential applications for psychosis in Alzheimers or pain management.

Shares of small-cap biotech **Myovant Sciences Ltd** doubled after Myovant reported on Tuesday that the the Phase 3 study that evaluated once-daily oral relugolix 120mg in men with advanced prostate cancer met the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as six key secondary endpoints.

Now as far as I can see, relugolix faces some competition in its end market meaning its not going to have the market all to itself. One commentator suggested it would win just 5% of the market. I think that is low, men don't like having their testosterone levels suppressed (given the side effects of hot flashes, fatigue and loss of sexual desire and function) and relugolix can help reduce the time patients need to use the therapy.

Data has shown relugolix quickly lowered testosterone to castration levels and the study also showed testosterone levels recovered faster after patients stopped taking relugolix, which could bring benefit for drug holidays or intermittent therapy.

Consequently I think a 10%+ market share along with 85% probability of success, 3 million people in the US with prostate cancer and cost of treatment $4,400 (based on firmagon estimates) then we have a TAM of $1.1 bn (10% x 85% x 3m x cost of treatment $4,400).

With 30% margins and a PE multiple of 10 you get a target valuation of $3.4 billion compared to current market cap of $1.15 billion. I suspect the 30% margin assumption or the 10% market share assumption maybe too high. But even if that is the case, I dont think Myovant's current mcap is expensive.

Stock closed up 128% with market cap of $1.26 billion.

Now for an off the scale speculative stock. Please exercise extreme caution. New Jersey-based **Hepion Pharmaceuticals** (market cap $12.4 million) reported on Thursday that its CRV431 treatment prevented the development of liver cirrhosis in a highly aggressive, preclinical model of liver disease in an animal study.

""The results align with previous findings in other experimental models and highlight the tremendous potential of CRV431 as a treatment for liver diseases, including NASH, where progression to cirrhosis is a primary medical concern,"" said Hepion CEO Robert Foster.

I’ll just say caveat emptor and it’ll be a great a story if it works out.

**Insider (Nesco Holdings)**

On Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Lee Jacobson purchased $352,154 worth of Nesco Holdings, picking up the stock after a drop of almost 70% this year. 

Nesco is one of the largest specialty equipment rental providers to the electric utility transmission, telecom and rail industries in North America. It reported mixed Q3 results a couple of weeks ago with revenues down 2.6% and a loss of $18 million but the company generated solid revenue growth in both the equipment rental (up 7.3%) and parts, tools, and accessories businesses (up 51.2%), as well as the 13th consecutive quarter of growth in adjusted EBITDA (up 7.5%).

At the time Lee Jacobson, CEO of Nesco, remarked ""We continue to see considerable opportunities for organic growth, supported by growing customer backlogs within our core electric utility markets, increased market penetration of the rail and telecom markets and further penetration of the parts tools and accessories offering across our existing equipment rental customer base. Shortages for specialty rental equipment in the markets we serve have continued and our customer rental contract periods have lengthened to record levels, further supporting our planned investment in fleet growth.”

That is a very positive outlook from Mr Jacobson and, having almost doubled his shareholding, he has backed that up with his own cash. With the stock trading on 0.6x revenues other investors may also want to have a closer look.

I’ve researched everywhere and couldn’t find the answer to the following questions:

Why do we trade stocks? Yes, we can buy low and sell high (or borrow then sell high and buy lower to return the burrowed)... but what causes that high or low? Supply and demand right? People crave that stock so the prices rocket because supply is lowering and demand is high. But why did the demand of that stock increase or decrease in the first place?  Why did everyone just decide to buy the stock of the company across the street? Let’s say they are doing well, what is the incentive of buying a stock of a prospering company and why do earning reports sometimes drive a stock up or down? I understand why it’s harmful to purchase stocks of companies on the brink of bankruptcy because no one wants to own parts of a company that may not exist tomorrow. But why does Apple or Microsoft stock fall at all when they will be here for hundreds of years maybe even millenniums. 
Also during non earning report days what do stocks go down or up at all? How are people able to judge the success of McDonalds without any news or statistics of customer growth? And when those statistics release why do they matter anyway since McDonalds    statistically will probably have a net income over $0 every given year for quite a while. 

What if all millionaires just decided to say “hey let’s all buy shares of this penny stock that has been extremely profitable for decades” wouldn’t the demand be higher and supply lower and thus price go up and drastically benefit those who made this pact? I understand the stock would then be overbought and then plummet because people would want to take profits. Who is in control of saying “hey this stock demand decreased 55% so let’s decrease the price by 55%” (most of the time its not even constant and why is that?). It’s not like the company has complete control over their share prices as they would over their physical merchandise right?

I don’t think it’s as simple as low demand = low share prices because I’ve seen some penny stocks with higher volume than Berkshire Hathaway yet a Berkshire share is worth over 70,000x any given day.

In perspective, the certainty of the deal presents an opportunity to safely use leverage — borrowed money — to increase rate of return. Though there are evils in borrowing money, this typical arbitrage situation (if certain) will reach fruition that we can make an exception. Borrowing money to invest in a risky investment is a sure way to go broke. 

However a high probability of the arbitrage deal being completed equates to a large amount of the risk being removed. Not that we can ever remove all risk, but if most of it is removed, then most of the risk using borrowed money is also removed. It is the (certainty) of the deal that allows us to use large amounts of leverage. If it is in fact “certain” that we will make our projected profit, it is safe to use borrowed money to increase our rate of return. The certainty of the deal — the high probability of its success — counterbalances the risk added by the use of leverage. 

When the market takes a nosedive, we can leverage up on arbitrage deals and make fantastic returns, which countered the effects of a poor performance in the rest of the partnership’s portfolio.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

It provides a broad portfolio of services to simplify the consumer shopping experience, while at the same time making it more affordable and rewarding. The combination of Honey's complementary consumer products with our platform will significantly enhance our ability to drive engagement and play a more meaningful role in the daily lives of our consumers.”

Honey is expected to generate $200 million of revenues this year so, even though it is already profitable, the $4 billion price tag is not cheap.   However PayPal should be able toquickly  leverage its own platform with 300 million users to significantly increase Honey’s user numbers (currently 17 million) and revenue.

In return Honey should help engage PayPal at an earlier stage of the sales funnel , develop a deeper relationship with consumers and increase usage (90% of Honey users are active every month).

Additionally, the acquisition will bring valuable data insights into online shopping behavior allowing PayPal to reach deeper into online shopping and offer a wider range of services and solutions to consumers and merchants. 

PayPal’s stock is down 1.5% but it looks like a good way for the $120 billion company to use part of its $11 billion of cash pile.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.

I entered again at $137 per share, all in. Now it is around 80ish. Sold everything and end up lost 5K.

I could not sleep, concentrate at work, and spend good time with my family well. I think I lost more on my personal life then the money it self.

So my wife and I are trying to pay off our mortgage on our RENTAL PROPERTY within 10 years. Here are some details. Btw, this is in New Zealand where we have no capital gains tax and properties general increase in price as time goes on.

Bought for 405,000

Mortgage at 368,000 at 4.99%

Tenants pay 1740 a month for rent, we put an extra 2000 on top of that.  
In 10 years we would pay around 125,000 in interest. However we would be mortgage free and now have a property increasing in value and providing monthly income. For a 30 year mortgage, we would pay around 340,000.

BUT, WHAT IF I INVESTED THAT 2000 A MONTH IN THE S&amp;P?

Not that history is any predictor of future earnings, but the last ten years in the S&amp;P would have netted someone $379,228 if they drip feed an account 2000 a month for 10 years.

Any thoughts? My gut says I should should pay it off in 30 and invest in the S&amp;P. Anyone else in a similar situation?

They simplify the transfer of funds between crypto exchanges. Stablecoins make purchases faster and less expensive and are used as a medium of exchange, a means of storing value, and a unit of account. In 2012, Mastercoin proposed a stable-value cryptocurrency, which was later renamed as Omni.

A collateralized stablecoins is pegged to assets such as national currencies, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. In centralized models, the stablecoin issuers back the value of their coin by holding the asset.

A Stablecoin’s value is pegged, for instance, to the USD at a 1:1 fixed exchange rate. Other stablecoins are pegged to the price of crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, with algorithms that manage supply and demand of the coin and the reserves. Regardless of how a stablecoin is backed, its value is in its price stability.

In a crypto-collateralized arrangement, a cryptocurrency backs a stablecoin, while seigniorage tokens are not collateralized by anything other than software, which maintains the price stability. A hybrid stablecoin might blend the three above approaches.

**Fiat-backed Stablecoin**

Fiat-backed stablecoins are backed by fiat currencies at a 1:1 ratio. Custodians manage the fiat in such an arrangement by holding the proper amount of backing currency in an account. Fiat-backed tokens can be issued or destroyed by the custodian as needed to maintain the peg. Stablecoins today are backed by the euro, Japanese yen, and other fiat currencies. Of course, stablecoins where funds are held in bank accounts or by third-parties are susceptible to fraud.

A problem with fiat-backed stablecoins is their centralization.

**Commodity-Backed Stablecoin**

Commodity-backed stablecoins are pegged to a commodity, such as gold or silver. A token could be backed by one gram of gold stored in a third-party custodian’s vaults.

These stablecoins are backed by one or more commodities. The backing commodity must reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin.

**Cryptocurrency-Backed Stablecoin**

A Crypto-collateralized stablecoin is backed by a cryptocurrency and sometimes a basket thereof. Certain mathematical innovations were needed in order to make such a stablecoin possible. These stablecoins are considered a more decentralized alternative to other stablecoins.

A major difference between this type of stablecoin and the abovementioned types is the former is handled on blockchain, with smart contracts, where the latter are done in the physical world through bank accounts or gold custodians.

These stablecoins are oftentimes more complex and require more collateral, due to the volatile nature of the backing cryptocurrencies themselves, than the abovementioned stablecoins.

**Seigniorage-Style Stablecoin**

A seigniorage-Style stablecoin is stabilized by an algorithm. The algorithm could, for instance, control the supply of the seigniorage-style stablecoin. New stablecoins can be minted to stabilize prices if demand for the stablecoin increases.

**Libra, JPMorgan Coin &amp; The Stablecoin Market**

Big institutions have shown interest in creating their own stablecoins. Facebook’s Libra is a stablecoin, because the social networking site sees stablecoins as a potential bridge between the existing world of government-issued money and a crypto-based future.

Stablecoins are also gaining attention from the likes of JPMorgan Chase Inc. According to Facebook, Libra will be backed by “a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.” Libra’s value will fluctuate in the same manner that the US dollar varies compared with the euro or yen from day-to-day. Exchanges will be established so that users can convert fiat for Libra.

JP Morgan says its JPM coin will enable fast money transfers between its corporate customers on an internal, private blockchain. JPM Coin is backed by the U.S. dollars held by the bank.

The Federal Reserve has been advised to [consider](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/central-bankers-told-they-should-be-sprinting-toward-blockchain) stablecoins, and the central bank of Sweden is planning a pilot project with an “e-krona” later this year.

**Money on Chain: A Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoin**

Money on Chain foresees big things for stablecoins, too. That’s why in 2015 we started to work on a stablecoin for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

We chose to design a stablecoin on top of Bitcoin because it allowed us to build a truly decentralized stablecoin. We believe Bitcoin’s decentralization and censorship resistance is crucial to a stablecoin.

We’ve created a stablecoin pegged to the American Dollar (Dollar On Chain) that incentivizes various participants in the Bitcoin systems.

Money On Chain is made by Bitcoiners for Bitcoiners.

**TLDR;**  Abiomed is at a low price due to some bad PR. Company is still  fundamentally sound, and is now undervalued. 

Abiomed  is a stock in the healthcare sector, they specifically produce the  Impella line of products which are heart pumps (an alternative to  Intra-aortic balloon pumps).

On  Nov. 17th a university study came out that said these products (Impella)  actually are a worse alternative. The stock price took a pretty big  hit. Now at this point there it is important to state that the products  in question are all FDA approved, and backed by a decade of clinical  trials and hard data. Impella heart pumps are consider Class III  according to the FDA, meaning: ""These devices usually sustain or support  life, are implanted, or present  potential unreasonable risk of illness  or injury. Examples of Class III  devices include implantable  pacemakers and breast implants. 10% of  medical devices fall under this  category."" Because of this high classification, they undergo an even  higher degree of scrutiny before approval. Ducks must be in order. Your  monkeys must all be accounted for.

Abiomed  responded to this study today in a video, and although I am not a  cardiac surgeon and have no medical training, it seemed to point out  some huge flaws in the Washington study. Tomorrow morning I am expecting  an upwards market correction, as investors stop panicking and take this  new information into account.

**HERES MY QUESTION:**

1. Am I correct in expecting the opening price to be higher than the closing price, due to after market buys?
2. Opening  hours are volatile, and likely especially so in this case (the Abiomed  response was release after market close). Should I wait a few minutes  and see if the price spikes in the beginning, then drops as a few  investors try to make a quick buck? I could buy at this low point, but  what if the low point does not come and the stock climbs rapidly and I  lose out on profits?
3. I am torn between a market on open order, or a limit buy on open.

Thanks in advance for your opinions! I was gonna put links in here to get you more information, but I got flagged as a bot. lol If you want to read or watch abiomeds response and criticism of the study, go to their website and look at press released under investor information. The study by the university can be found in circulation by the American Heart Association.

I have found several different sites which would allow me to trade stocks but I am not interested in trading, I would like to invest long term and from what I have found till now, the only possible way to invest in stocks for me, is to go through a bank here in Kosovo(which is charging 25EUR for every buy/sell order).

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Been investing for about 1.5 years. 

I'm trying to figure out how to play WCG (Wellcare), which is going through a merger with Centene. More specifically, I invested in WCG about a year ago, and the stock is now up about 50%. I'm wondering how the merger with Centene will play out over the long and short-term.  Here's details about the merger: 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-27/centene-to-buy-wellcare-in-cash-stock-deal-valued-305-39-shr-jtr1w7pp](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-27/centene-to-buy-wellcare-in-cash-stock-deal-valued-305-39-shr-jtr1w7pp)

The main takeaway for me is that Centene  will acquire WellCare for ""3.38 shares of Centene and $120/share in cash, implying a total enterprise value of $17.3 billion and a per-share value of $305.39""

Can someone explain what the implication is for someone like me, who's only holding about 10K worth of WCG stocks?  Is the merger meaningful to me? What exactly happens if the merger is approved?

I, like make other naive individuals, just assumed it made sense to do so. But then I realized that I couldn't justify it making sense to myself, and after much reflection and research, I have decided it's a Scam.

{*Full disclosure: I think bonds would be a good investment, but not while we have a centrally and illegally counterfeited currency, because that negates any potential gains. I keep my value in MONEY. Research the word and you'll know what I look for in a good money.*}

Here's my reasoning.

NOBODY has been able to explain to me where the fundamental value of the Stock Market comes from. It's just a bunch of neomarxist and Keynesian idiots touting about ""intrinsic value"" and ""muh gainz (#NumberGoUp)"".

Countless attempts at researching it hasn't yielded anything for me either.

But here's what I got so far.

1) ""It's valuable because it's legal ownership of a company!"" Except it's not, that doesn't matter at all, **a company can just print more stock and give it to themselves**, and **nobody can show me a law*** that says holding a stock literally means having legal ownership and ownership of earnings. **Nor can anybody show me a contract** that says I as a shareholder am entitled to anything, on any condition.

2) ""It's valuable if they have good earnings!"" **Except people that hold the stock aren't paid in these earnings**, and fluctuations in **earnings don't represent the fluctuations in value of a stock**, in fact, the market almost always gives an irrational kneejerk /overeacting reaction between the two.

3) ""It's valuable because of dividends!"" except most of the **most valuable companies don't pay any dividends** at all, owning thousands of dollars in a stock only yields a **negligible few cents** that doesn't even cover trading fees unless you sit on your hands for more than ten years, and honestly the price of any stock and it's almost zero earning has almost no relationship whatsoever because it's not even possible to make any significant money from these earnings that you couldn't easier do by holding a savings account.

4) ""Don't criticise the stock market if you don't understand it!"" **as all these morons who don't understand it INVEST tens of thousands of dollars** into it. Let that one sink in.

5) ""IPOs help a business start out with money!"" Except it costs millions to launch an IPO. If I ever need to start a business, I guess I'll just save up a few million dollars first, ""thank you stock market"".


So where does the stock market get it's value? The whole thing looks like it's in a continual uptrend, just a straight shot to the Moon. So obviously value is coming from somewhere, but who is creating it?

Fundamentally, **what's the incentive for a business to pay dividends** or buy their own stock to increase it's price? 

Fundamentally, **what value do you create by buying or selling a stock**?

I'll tell you. I bet these companies are getting **tax write-offs** and **subsidies** for a lot of the things they do, and then the corrupt government steps in and **dumps billions of dollars of quantitative easing into the stock market machine** to keep it afloat. Then millions in propaganda to keep it looking good to the public.

So where does the stock market get it's value? Quantitative Easing, Subsidies, Tax Write-Offs, and Propaganda.

It's a huge money racketeering scheme for the rich, where the government steals from honest people and pours it into this hyperspeculative pseudo financial machine so that day traders can make a living off of following charts and trading with other people's money.

Fundamentally, the stock market is a **1 person wins for every 1 person that loses** kind of game. In order for you to make money, you have to rip off later investors, the business who you shorted, or the taxpayers who gave their **sweat, blood, and tears** for you to make a cheap buck, under the guise that their taxpayer money is going into useful things like **[not] fixing roads or bettering society**.

The stock market is not a ""investment"". It's **gambling**, oftentimes with **other people's money**. By **having your bets subsidized**, you get to win more bets than what you lose. **But only if you're rich enough**to get all the inside trading tricks aka **market manipulation**.

Let me tell you what a real investment is. **Loaning your money to a person or business in need** after doing proper risk analysis is a **legitimate investment**, as well as **purchasing and fixing property** such as houses, cars, and technology, or the **production of useful goods and services in the economy**.

Not a bad trading day overall and learned a few lessons. 

1. There's nothing wrong with buying at the top when the market is in full fomo, but don't average down until after the bounce. That cost me a few dollars today where I'd have been up even more not getting stopped out.  
2. Focusing on the trade &gt; focusing on the money. I've taken this to heart over the last few months and my trading has done so much better because of it!

Initial Public Offering seeks a direct listing approach to a featured, original painting created by the artist. 75% of the painting is available to the public which will be distributed through 9 shares. The painting has been divided into the 9 available shares through an unbiased algorithmic process. The price of each share, $25.63, has then been determined by the overall cost of materials to make the original work. The offering will be open until the clock runs out, which is set for two weeks. When the clock zeros, the featured painting will be severed into the pre-determined shares shown on the homepage.

&amp;#x200B;

* Penny stocks are classified as stocks with a per-share value of $5.00 or less
* Although they are much cheaper than many other stocks, they are also much more volatile to fluctuation. 
* Therefore, there is a greater risk of loss when investing in penny stocks. 

#### Like they say, “A penny spared is a penny earned.”

**However**,  if we’re talking about investing in penny stocks, it’s quite easy to  lose the penny that you invested since the world of penny stocks can be *risky* and *complicated*. 

If you are someone who does not own enough  money to make a big investment, then chances are you might be tempted to  buy low-cost penny stocks. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Before you make the decision to invest, there are a few things you should be aware of. **Continue reading to find out**.

#### How do penny stocks work?

&amp;#x200B;

* Penny stocks are basically like any other stock, but **one should be more cautious when buying them as there is a lot of risk of loss involved.** 

As compared to other stocks, these ones are *less liquid*.  This is because they exchange hands less regularly due to lower volume.  Penny stocks also regularly experience many rate swings which cause  them to be labeled as a **risky investment.**

&amp;#x200B;

* Because of their **lower market capitalization**  and per-share price, one should be cautious while investing in penny  stocks. Many companies that sell penny stocks are known to be **very unreliable.**

 

With less inclusion from financial specialists, there is not enough data present on them which makes it harder to settle on decent trading decisions. Since there is no need for them to file with the **SEC**, the data available on them is usually limited and untrustworthy.

A penny stock is normally classified as a stock with a **per-share value of $5.00 or less**. You won’t find penny stocks being traded at the normal stock exchanges. 

Rather, penny stocks are traded through pink sheets at over-the-counter markets. Smaller businesses and companies with assets valuing less than $5 million are more likely to invest in penny stocks.

How does penny stock trading happen? 

**Unlike ordinary stocks**  where offer costs can be found on the internet and in the paper,  looking for the selling and purchasing cost of a penny stock is more  confusing.

*Let’s break it down!*

&amp;#x200B;

* Upon transaction, the broker organizes an exchange for you dependent on the offer value.
* That is the sum somebody is happy to buy a stock at, also the asking value.
* The price at which somebody is eager to sell a stock. 

#### What is the risk of investing in penny stocks?

 

Well, there is always a **risk** when it comes to investing.

Because penny stocks are usually sold by  small to medium companies with little history of financials and the  portion of the profit that brokers might keep for themselves, it becomes more difficult for one to earn profits on the investments made in penny stocks.  

There's also a very good chance that you  will lose money. Most of the people who invest in penny stocks are the  ones who are willing to get into and out of the market as soon as they can, and this too is a reason that these stocks are unreliable.

#### Can you earn rewards on penny stocks?

You might occasionally, hear success  stories of penny stock on the market. Usually, this involves an  investment by an unknown organization that leads to profit for the investors.  

Though this **does not occur frequently**,  it is still one benefit of investing in penny stock. If a person  invests in penny stock in its early stages and it starts to do well in  the future, then *there is a chance of earning profits through that stock.*

But only a chance. 

#### Are Penny Stocks Worth it?

These stocks can prove to be profitable only if the one who is investing has a complete understanding of them. 

A wise thing to do is make an investment worth what the investor is prepared to lose. It’s  better if the investor does not invest all his money in penny stocks,  as there is a high chance that he might face a huge loss later on. 

Hence, it is **better to make small investments at first**.

One thing that investors should do while  purchasing penny stocks is set expectations that are realistic and  always keep in mind that the chances of earning through these  investments are lower. 

Also, the investor should be ready to cope with the  losses and misfortune that can occur due to investing in them. Prior to  purchasing penny stocks, guarantee that strong groups of organizations  have been gathered in your portfolio and ensure that these theoretical  stocks are just a small part of your overall investments.

 

#### A word of warning

One thing that investors should be aware of  before putting their money in penny stocks is that there is a lot of  manipulation of price value by the trading agents in this market. At  times, their activities can even cause organizations to leave the business. 

While regular stocks  are traded by the broker on your behalf, penny stockbrokers are free to  make deals that are beneficial for them. It doesn't always happen that they are trading for your benefit.

#### Conclusion

It is true that deciding whether to invest  in a penny stock or not is a critical decision. Before you decide to do  so make sure that you do proper research on penny stocks so you know  what you are opting for.

As far as I understood, a stock's price volume mainly depends on how much everyone else invested in it. 

So a company might be having very good profits, but might not have a high stock price volume simply because it's not well known.

I am in my early 20’s and I have an initial $500 lump sum and can contribute up to $50 - $100 monthly.

I am aware the US market is in the longest bull run but I’m looking to do this for the long term, also with a looming devaluation of the naira( our local currency) it’s safe to build wealth in USD

**For investors, penny stocks have two sides**. 

On one side there is *instant wealth* and *market-crushing gains*, which would make anyone a millionaire.

On the other side, there is *possible fraud*, *pump and dump schemes*, *bankrupt companies*, and massive losses. 

This makes you wonder, **are penny stocks worth the investment and the risk?** 

Investing in penny stocks is not for everyone, really. 

This is **not an investment for people who are risk-averse.** Only *reliable* penny stocks that are expected to *pay good returns* in the future should be purchased, and with thorough due diligence 

### How to Determine What Qualifies as a Top Penny Stock?

For a penny stock to qualify as a ""great"" one, there are certain qualities that it must have. 

* The company should have **strong fundamentals** and **quality management.** 
* They should have a **solid balance sheet**, **growing revenues** and earnings as well as a competitive edge against their industry rivals.
* Having **inside ownership** is always a plus because it shows that the management has an interest in the company. This **lessens the chances of financial gimmickry**.

On the other hand, a typical **red flag** is having **excessive debt without sufficient revenue to cover the liabilities**.

*Moreover, the industry in which the company belongs should also be expanding rapidly.* 

The  companies which are developing breakthrough technologies are quite  promising. These entrepreneurial firms are poised for changing the  status quo, which means they will end up surviving the bad times. 

### Top 5 Penny Stocks to Invest in

**GlobalStar**

GlobalStar has a **market capitalization of $600.9 million** and provides **mobile satellite voice and data services** all over the world. 

The company also offers **two-way voice and data products**, for individuals as well as for businesses in remote areas.

* **GlobalStar**  does not compete with terrestrial networks. Rather, it complements  them. It sells access to its systems and regional telecom service  providers.

It is a good idea to choose this penny stock as  an investment since this company would benefit from population growth  and the rising affluence of consumers in remote areas within the  emerging markets. The company also boasts a profit margin of around  52.7% and their quarterly revenue growth is about 8.6%. Earnings are  also expected to rise over the years and are projected to hit 15% on an  annualized basis.

I'm new to investing but I'm trying to do as much research as I can. Right now my portfolio is made up of one REIT, a couple ""dying"" companies that I personally believe aren't really dying yet, and some VERY small fractions of crypto.
Right now my value is about $40 and some change (which is what I deposited when I decided to start this plan last week) I'm looking for some advice on  how to do this right, also feel free to tell me if I've already made a really dumb choice, and please do weigh in your suggestions of where to go from here, what stocks should I ditch? What stocks should I look into?
Heres my current portfolio:

1.New Residential investment (NRZ) - 1 share
   I chose NRZ because of their excellent record, long upward trend, very high dividend, and constantly out performing their expected EPS, I believe in diversity and I think a small percentage of my portfolio should be kept in REITs

2. Ford (F) - 2 shares
   I chose to invest in ford because even though the numbers suggest their a ""dying"" company, I know that they're making some huge changes in their production, and I really believe that they're not going anywhere soon, as one of the leading names in the automotive industry, I believe they have a chance. Not to mention their 7% dividend is very enticing.

3. Gamestop (GME) - 1 share
   I chose to invest in gamestop because as a 21 year old guy in 2019, videogames is in my comfort zone, over the last year they have definitely been on thin ice, and their records reflect that, but however what many of people who aren't involved in video games dont understand is that the current gen consoles (xbox one, ps4, ect.) Are nearing the end of their lifespan, it has already been stated that next year Sony and Microsoft will be rolling out the red carpet for next generations systems (I wish I could afford a Microsoft share) and this will not only spark more sales at gamestop, but will help their ""circle of life"" business model, people will come trade in their old ps4's and buy ps5's, then comes the wave of people who have similar financial situations as me, you know, the people who always have LAST years model of whatever they own, these sales of used products are gamestop's bread and butter, I hope to get more shares soon before the consoles are officially announced.

4. Frontier (FTR) - 2 shares
   I chose frontier because while they are a shitty company (I was once a customer) I must give props to the fact that they have a large stranglehold on rural internet service, and with their shares being worth pennies, I figured why not take the gamble. This stock is expendable and I wouldn't be upset if they went bankrupt, I plan to throw $100 in this stock over the next year and roll the dice, maybe they go bankrupt, or maybe they save the company and the share price climbs back up to that of their competitors, in which I'd make a pretty penny (this ones honestly just for the hell of it)

5. Bitcoin (BTC) - 0.00035316 of one bitcoin (I paid $3)
I figured this ones another dice roll. I make my monthly contribution, pick which stocks in portfolio I want to build on, or new stocks to add, and then there's a couple bucks leftover, may as well dump it into bitcoin, kind of like the acorns app, ya know, you buy a coffee or something and that dew cents change is worthless, so may as well invest it. That's what's nice about crypto, is you can literally just buy it in fractions, you put however much money in that you want, and that money then fluctuates with the price of the cryptocurrency. This one I'm looking at in a similar way as frontier, that leftover 3 bucks wasn't too important to me, so may as well roll the dice, and again next month with whatevers left after buying stocks, it might add up to something big overtime, but if not, I'm not going to miss $3, even if its $3 every  month for a year, I'm not going to notice my wallets $3 short,and who knows maybe I'll make an extra buck.

So now that I've given you my whole life story, what do you think? Feel free to give any advice or weigh in about how my logic is either extremely flawed or whatever contribution you feel is helpful. Some other things that might help explain my situation:

-I can only afford to continue $25 a month right now, but by july of 2020 I will be tapering up until I am contributing $200 a month

-my overall plan for investment is 10-15 years, but I will likely be switching stocks or moving money around every 1 or  2 years, depending on how I see fit 

-I want to avoid index funds, as I like to invest in specific stocks that I can look into, I like to know what  I'm paying into is something I believe in.

-my goal is undecided, maybe I'll spend the next 10 years growing this for a down payment on a house, or maybe I'll get lucky, it does well, and I move all the money into a reliable dividend stock to supplement my income, I'm 21 years old and theres no telling where life will go.

-I understand this portfolio seems risky (obviously not at a $40 value but if I dumped $200 a month into these stocks for 1 year it could be) but as I said I'm young, and by the time I'm ready to cash out I will have likely moved my money far away from some of these stocks, i plan on spending these next few years making short term high risk investments for the hell of it, and maybe I'll do good and maybe your advice will help, but just don't mark me a fool, this will not be my ""life savings"" in these stocks, I have a 401k that I'm not touching until I'm 65, and i work a full time job, this is literally just something i want to do with my extra money to see if I can give myself a nice little present by the time I'm 30-35.

There is no torrent for his DVD's. It must be purchased. If you don't believe me go and search for yourself or ask anyone on here. They are really hard to acquire.

Many websites including [eDollarCourse](https://edollarcourse.com/product/steven-dux-freedom-challenge/) sell his DVD's for cheap, but not cheap enough. eDollarCourse sells **just the freedom challenge** for $109USD.

I am going even cheaper and selling **ALL THREE DVD's for $65USD.** I can even sell them individually instead of all three if you would like. The individual prices can be discussed if you drop me an email.

Once payment is made through PayPal, I will send you the MEGA links for the downloads. Payment is safe as I will issue an invoice where I state my refund policy/terms and conditions.

Overall, this offer is great compared to everyone out there. If you are interested email [**snakhoul04@gmail.com**](mailto:snakhoul04@gmail.com)

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 18th, 2019.

# **After Dow tops 28,000, the next 1,000 points will be determined by trade talks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/trade-talks-will-decide-whether-market-rips-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks bounced on trade headlines on Friday, but the market could stall out in the week ahead if there is no real progress toward a deal.
*****
&gt; Stocks ended the week at record highs, but Treasury yields unwound half the big move of the prior week, as doubts surfaced about a trade pact getting completed.
*****
&gt; The Dow soared above 28,000 for the first time, ending the week at 28,004, with a gain of 1.2% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week up 0.9% at 3,120.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, there is a last blast of earnings, from a few big retailers including Home Depot, Macy’s and Target. Walmart in the past week raised its outlook and said consumers looked healthy going into the holiday season.
*****
&gt; There are some economic releases, but the most important report will be the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting. At that meeting, the Fed cut interest rates and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that it was done with policy changes for now.
*****
&gt; There is housing data with housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There is also Markit manufacturing and services PMI, which will be watched carefully Friday for signs of a pickup in manufacturing activity or any spillover from manufacturing weakness into services.
*****
&gt; “We’ve had Powell speak. It’s crystal clear at this point on what the Fed is thinking going forward,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. “It feels like with retail sales behind us we go to the half of the month where things are going to be pretty quiet for a while.” Powell also testified in the past week, on both Wednesday and Thursday, before congressional committees.
*****
&gt; It’s trade that could be the big factor for the market. In the past week, stocks barely budged when trade news pointed to a possible lack of progress and the focus was on demands by the Chinese to roll back tariffs. But stocks turned around and rallied Friday on comments from White House top economic advisor Larry Kudlow, who said the U.S. and China were getting close to a deal.
*****
&gt; “Honestly, next week it’s going to be every day: ‘Give me the details on the trade deal,’” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. He does expect a deal, but the markets have been trading for weeks on the expectations one would come any day.
*****
&gt; “They’re desperate to do something. They know they can’t leave the market hanging at all-time highs without a written agreement,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; As stocks rallied to new highs in the past week, Treasury yields backed off recent highs. The 10-year Treasury, after hitting a high yield of 1.97% the week earlier, was at 1.83% Friday. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; “Our view is given the rally in the market, and unless we get really, really concrete indications of a trade deal being done and a date being set for signing, there is a potential for a pause in the rally in our view,” said Julian Emanuel, head equities and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the impeachment hearing is not impacting the market and investors are ignoring it for now. “If headlines from Washington between Republicans and Democrats become more contentious that could become a focus as well,” he said. But for now, investors do not expect the Senate to find that President Donald Trump did anything wrong though he will probably be impeached by the House.
*****
&gt; Stocks could ignore that unless the hearings uncover something that would change the tone of the investigation enough to move Republicans to support impeachment of the president.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he expects the market to correct either this year or in the first part of next year.
*****
&gt; “We actually think the potential for consolidation in the market in the near term is kind of ripe because we’ve gone a long way since the fourth quarter started,” Emanuel said. The S&amp;P 500 is up 4.8% quarter to date and up 24.4% year to date.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he believes if there is a sell-off, the market will recover and continue its move higher. He said one reason the market rally could keep going and a sell-off would not be severe is that investors are still apprehensive about the stock market. He said many are confused about where to invest and are not piling into the rotation into cyclicals and away from defense.
*****
&gt; “We’ve seen people basically adding market exposure,” Emanuel said. “The embracing of the rotation is probably only in the second or third inning. ... We think the ninth inning is by the middle of next year.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel and other strategists say that trend is powerful enough to keep the market going higher.

# Pace of Market Gains Likely to Slow in 2020

&gt; With pre-election year 2019 quickly nearing its end and the market closely tracking historical, seasonal performance throughout, let’s preview how election-year 2020 could unfold based upon historical seasonal patterns. In the following three charts for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ historical performance in Election Years, All Years and when a sitting Republican was running for a second term have been plotted.

&gt; Since 1950 there have been five Republican Presidents that ran for a second term, Eisenhower (1956), Nixon (1972), Reagan (1984), G. H. W. Bush (1992) and G. W. Bush (2004). Only G. H. W. Bush failed to win re-election in 1992. DJIA’s average performance in these five election years was 4.1%. DJIA’s best year was 1972, advancing 14.6%, its worst year was 1984 with a 3.7% loss.

&gt; When comparing these past five Election Years when a sitting Republican was running for re-election to All Years and all Election Years, average performance is noticeably weaker. Part of this could be due to strong above average performance in the preceding pre-election years where DJIA averaged 18.6% (1955, 1971, 1983, 1991 and 2003). Nonetheless, the current bull market is likely to continue into and through 2020 as the market has historically performed better with a sitting president running compared to an open field. However, gains may not match the pace of 2019.

# Above Average November Could Stumble Before Thanksgiving

&gt; Stocks have been strong to start off this November. As of today’s close DJIA is up 2.39%, S&amp;P 500 +1.79%, NASDAQ +2.34% and the Russell 2000 has risen 2.09%. This is well above historical average performance in pre-election year Novembers. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have averaged just 0.3% gains in 17 pre-election year Novembers since 1950. Gains this month have been driven by better than expected earnings and an improving trade outlook. However, risks still remain. Trade is likely the biggest as a deal, Phase 1 or other, still remains elusive. November also has a historical tendency to weaken after mid-month with major indexes historically surrendering the major of their first half gains beginning around the 11th trading day through the fourteenth trading day. Should such a dip occur this November, don’t despair as the month also has a historical tendency to rally strongly from around the fifteenth trading day to its end.

# Sluggish Manufacturing in the New York Region

&gt; This morning saw one of the first looks at November activity with the NY Fed Empire Manufacturing report. Economists weren't expecting much of a strong report to begin with as the consensus forecast for the headline General Business Conditions index was for a reading of 6.0 vs last month's reading of 4.0. The actual reading actually showed a slight decline from last month, though, falling to 2.9. While the current conditions index declined, expectations actually saw a small boost rising from 17.1 up to 19.4.

&gt; One interesting thing to note is how little Empire Manufacturing has changed in recent months. With monthly readings of 4.3, 4.8, 2.0, 4.0, and now 2.9, the index has had a five-month range of just 2.8 points. In the history of the survey dating back to 2001, the only five-month window with a narrower range was in late 2011!

&gt; In terms of plans for Capital Expenditures and Technology Spending over the next six months, it was encouraging to see both of these readings rebound after falling sharply in recent months.

&gt; Finally, the table below shows the month/month change for each category of the Empire Manufacturing report in terms of both current conditions and expectations. What's interesting to note about this month's data is that while there was broad-based weakness in terms of current conditions, expectations rebounded, suggesting that manufacturers are expecting an upturn from current conditions.

# Shrinking Ranges

&gt; In the S&amp;P 500's run to new highs over the last few weeks, overall volatility has really become subdued. For example, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't had an intraday swing of even 1% in more than a month now. The chart below shows streaks over the last ten years where the S&amp;P 500 didn't see a 1% spread between its intraday high and low and allows us to compare how the current streak stacks up to prior periods.

&gt; While the current 24 trading day streak without a 1% intraday move is far from the longest over the last ten years, there haven't been a lot of streaks that were longer. Ironically enough, the three streaks that were the longest of the last ten years all occurred in the two years after the 2016 election. For all the turmoil that seems to surround this Administration, market turmoil hasn't been one of them.

# Sentiment Stays the Same

&gt; Despite a couple closes at all-time highs in the past week, the S&amp;P 500 is currently right around the same levels as last Wednesday's close. With little in the way of price changes, sentiment has likewise seen little change. Per AAII's weekly survey, bullish sentiment rose just 0.42 percentage points to 40.72% from 40.30% last week. That small increase is in the bottom 5% of all week-over-week changes in bullish sentiment in the history of the data.

&gt; While little changed, the bulk of investors are still optimistic. Another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence also echoed these results. In that survey released yesterday, 57.6% reported as bullish. While that is the highest reading since July, it is up only around half of one percent from last week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111419-AAII-Bullish.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment was also little changed. The percentage of investors reporting as pessimistic rose 0.89 percentage points to 24.82%. Like bullish sentiment, the one week change in bearish sentiment was small relative to history with this week's change sitting in the 7th percentile of all readings. This week also marked the fourth in a row that bearish sentiment has been below its historical average. That is the longest such streak since a seven-week run from the end of March to early May of this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111419-AAII-Bearish.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment moved the most this week falling 1.31 percentage points. Now at 34.46%, neutral sentiment is the lowest since early September and back in the middle of the past few years' range.

# Record Closes Starting to Pile Up Again

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's breakout to new highs in late October has kicked off a resumption in the count of record closing highs with half a dozen in just the last twelve trading days. With four record closing highs during the April failed breakout and then another nine in June and July, the total for 2019 now stands at 19, which is tied with 2018. A year ago today, the S&amp;P 500 was close to 8% below its record high, so therefore the prospect for additional highs to close out the year was low, but this year is another story altogether. As of this writing, the S&amp;P 500 is actually above its record closing high of 3,093.08, so not only are additional new highs likely over the next seven weeks, but we may even see one today.

&gt; The chart below shows the number of new highs for the S&amp;P 500 by year going back to 1950. Over the 70 years shown, the greatest number of record closing highs for a given year was in 1995 when there were 77, while 1964 saw the second most with 65. In the current bull market, 2017 had the most record closing highs at 62. 2017 was also a year where the S&amp;P 500 never saw a pullback of 3% or more, so therefore record highs were always within striking distance.

&gt; One interesting aspect of the chart is that there have basically been three distinct periods since 1950 where new highs for the S&amp;P 500 were clustered together. The first was from 1954 through 1968 (there were also two years in 1972 and 1973 but there were four years between without any) and the second spanned a 21-year window from 1980 through 2000. The latest period began seven years ago in 2013, and while it may seem like the current 10-year market run has become long in the tooth, if it's anything like the prior two periods, it could be another few years at least before occurrences of record new highs start to dry up.

The move is a potential watershed moment for the retail industry in general (and Amazon in particular) as strong brands realize that traffic driven to their own site is self-sustaining, more profitable, and actually brand enhancing.  That’s good news for brands and bad news for Amazon.

**Disney** had a good week with over 10 million signing up for its new streaming service. There were a few initial technical glitches but overall the app and the backlog catalogue were well received. The Star Wars based series, The Mandalorian, also received very positive feedback. However some commentators noted the lack of content for adults and questioned how long customers would be happy to watch the old classics. It’s an important question for Disney. The catalogue of classic content gives it a head start but it will still need to get up and running fast with consistent high quality (and expensive) new material. 

**Alphabet** said it was exploring ways it could “partner with banks and credit unions in the US to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay, helping their customers benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools,”. It’s the latest attempt by the company to break into the highly regulated world of finance. However, the partnership approach with banks (rather than competing with them) seems more likely to succeed and the opportunities for Alphabet to provide useful tools and Google Pay should benefit all parties.

**Growth stocks (Farfetch, Amarin and Grocery Outlet)** 

**Farfetch’s** stock is up 29% following a Q3 earnings beat with revenues up 90%, GMV up 59%, gross profit up 70% and guidance raised. 

Farfetch is a high-end fashion retailer that carries no inventory which is a major advantage when the risk of getting stuck with expensive stock you cannot sell is significant. Instead the company runs an online marketplace where more than 1,000 retailers and 3 million customers from over 50 countries.  Growth has been spectacular with revenue increasing by 50%+ for several years in a row.  

Significantly, Farfetch reported that the site’s top 10 brands (including Gucci, Prada and Fendi) had doubled the amount of stock they listed on the site (versus a year ago) and that more than 100 new luxury brands (including Stella McCartney and Brunello Cucinelli) have joined the platform.

This rapid growth has led to increasing networking effects and allows Farfetch to charge a 25% to 33% commission fee on sales made through its site. Current year forecast sales are still modest at just under $1 billion. Equally modest, in comparison to the opportunity, is the current market capitalization of $2.74 billion. The $300 billion global market for luxury products is in the midst of a structural shift to online and Farfetch, with its network effects, is in prime position to benefit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Amarin** rose 33% in a week that saw the FDA Advisory Committee vote unanimously to recommend approval of Vascepa label expansion.  However its current valuation (market cap $8.62 billion) still looks cheap compared to the huge opportunity that looks increasingly like it is about to become a reality.

Vascepa is currently approved to reduce triglycerides. The label expansion under consideration would allow it to be prescribed to prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes that affect millions of patients in the United States and are estimated to cost $500 billion annually. That’s not all up for grabs, but Amarin estimate there are 50 million people in the US alone who could benefit from the drug.  30% of that market at $1,000 p.a. would yield $15 billion in the US alone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grocery Outlet** reported strong Q3 earnings on Monday with revenues up 13.1%, comparable store sales up 5.8%, adjusted net income up 58.8% and adjusted EBITDA up 13.2%. Full year guidance was raised across the board with EPS rising from 69 cents to 73.5 cents at the midpoint (and comparable to 18 cents last year).

The company has been called the TJ Maxx of grocery and its business model is very similar. It sells branded goods at discounts of 40%-70% by acting as a clearing channel for producers. That offers a treasure hunt experience for buyers and useful way to offload excess inventory for producers. 

I was initially sceptical of the ability to implement the model for grocery but the results speak for themselves. It is true that the company has to buy and sell certain staples such as bread and milk like any other grocery store. However it appears that there is a huge range of goods (dry goods, cereals, wines, deli, frozen etc) that lend themselves very well to the model. Opportunistic purchases of fresh produce such as meat, fruit and vegetables enhance the product range.

The two drivers for this business are;

1.  There is a huge opportunity, Grocery Outlet currently has 330 locations but believes there is demand nationwide for 4,800 stores

2. Grocery Outlet (similar to TJ Maxx) is establishing itself as the go to market place for both producers and consumers. That leads to a virtuous circle of more high quality goods, more variety, more customers, more high quality goods.

The stock isn’t cheap on 43x current year estimates but the valuation appears very justifiable.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks (Tyson Foods and Verso)**

**Tyson Food's** rose 10% this week despite narrowly missing estimates on the top and bottom line and reporting a 33% drop in EPS (from the record year that was 2018). Nevertheless Q4 sales were up 9% and CEO Noel White said “We’re very optimistic about fiscal 2020, and we currently expect to meet or exceed our long-term earnings algorithm of high single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth as we’re well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the global marketplace.”

That optimism seems well placed. Tyson reported that its in-house rival to Beyond Meat, Raised &amp; Rooted, now supplies fake-chicken nuggets to around 7,000 stores. Significantly more than the 4,000 it had previously estimated.

It also bodes well for other Tyson Raised &amp; Rooted products; the chicken nuggets were essentially a pilot offering. The next one that'll hit store shelves is a blended hamburger that's a combination of Angus beef and plant protein.

The company also received a welcome boost on Thursday when China lifted its 4 year ban on US chicken products. All in all the stock looks cheap (no pun intended). Even after the rise the stock is valued on a trailing PE of 16.36 and just 13.5x current year estimates. That compares favourably to the 5 year historic annual growth rate of 16.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Verso Corporation**, the paper and pulp company, has struggled as demand for paper products has weakened. However my interest was aroused by the announcement this week that it has agreed the sale of Androscoggin and Stevens Point Mills for $400 million. The intention is to return a significant portion of the net proceeds to stockholders either by way of dividend or share repurchase. 

Now, I will highlight that I don’t know much about this industry and I expect there are many risks and costs involved with the business and the potential to offload the other mills. Nevertheless $400 million is a significant sum for a company with a market capitalization of $640 million. The company is currently valued at well under book value, has negligible debt and those 2 mills only account for around 20% of total capacity. If anyone has an insight it would be great to hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Speculative (****SmileDirectClub****)**

**SmileDirectClub,** the online startup disrupting the orthodontic industry, saw its shares fall 26% after its earnings report on Tuesday failed to impress. Third quarter sales surged 50.6% to $180.2 million but losses widened (as expected) to $88.3 million from a loss of $14.9 million in 2018. 

However, in my opinion, the short term quarterly results are of little importance. To understand the value of the company you must balance the huge potential opportunity that faces SmileDirectClub against the pending legislation that could impose harsher regulations on online dentistry companies. 

It is estimated that there are 124 million potential orthodontic customers in the U.S. and half a billion worldwide.  That's a total addressable market of $245 billion in the U.S. and $700 billion in the rest of the world. That is a global TAM of $945 billion compared to SmileDirectClub's current market cap of $3.3 billion.

The outcome of litigation processes are always extremely difficult to call. Nevertheless the stock offers a good balance of risk and reward. It is very high risk and potentially extremely high reward. Please be aware that this is a HIGH RISK highly speculative stock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Insider (Comscore)**

**Comscore’s** new CEO, Bill Livek, snapped up $1 million of stock on Tuesday (along with a few other insider purchases) following Q3 results last week. That should only enhance the strong incentives already in place for him to deliver a sale of the company at an advantageous value for investors. Livek, a 30-year veteran of the media and data measurement market, will receive a $1 million cash bonus from a sale. However, he will get an additional cash bonus (based on a percentage of the gross transaction if the sale yields $500 million or more in proceeds). That’s an 85% premium to Friday’s closing market capitalization of $270 million.

You heard us say that you win or lose the trade the moment you enter and my first trade out of the gate was a pure, and stupid FOMO. I then got quickly stopped out and realized my mistake then got jumpy and entered short... not in my trade plan. Then perfectly got stopped out there and should've called it a day at that point as it was two stupid moves and I was down ~$300 (-$700 unrealized profit which is 2x my daily personal limit).

I then kept trading and took a small 1 point profit and my first green trade of the day. Entered another trade both with horrible entries short and got out with a very small profit and was now committed to getting back to break even on the day... and nothing more! Took one last trade as the shorts gave up control and made it back to $62.50 (+$21.80 after commissions). 

I'm not proud of how I over traded today because it was completely my fault, but proud that I got back to break even instead of trying to go that extra step for profit and would've likely gone back in the red. 

The lesson for me. When you do stupid trades, you win stupid prizes so make sure that you review those mistakes to ensure that you don't those mistakes in the next trading session. I'm calling it a day and my 9th consecutive green day with $21.80 in profit.

Air Canada (tsx:AC) and American Airlines (AAL) are both currently valued at around 12.5 billion dollars. 

The MASSIVE difference I noticed between these companies, however, is that American airlines produces net income in the range of 1 billion, while air canada produces around 150 million in net income. (based off of recent results) 

How can two companies, one earning 10x more than its peer, be valued the same? Is there some great airline growth projection thesis towards air canada?

Coin flipping, one would think, would be 0% skill and 100% chance. While chess—a turn-based game where both players see all information at all times—would be 100% skill. The MIT scientists “reasoned that if a game were more skill-based, then a player’s performance should be persistent. It might be good or bad, but it would remain relatively constant over multiple rounds.”      

On a scale of zero (pure luck) to one (pure skill), coin flipping indeed ranked a zero. But moving back towards the stock market, the study also looked at **45,000 mutual funds’** performances from 2005 to 2015, and ended up giving mutual funds a score of **0.32**.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

If you are an investor and looking for market gains and success, the best thing for you to do is to **expand your time horizon**. 

Short-term investments do profit in the immediate term, but many times, unexpected events can derail your position. 

* If you pick ideas from the **best long-term stocks** in the market, and this can also include penny stocks to buy long term, then you **have the chance of improving your odds significantly**. 

Investing in a *financially sound company* helps in the trading dynamics and even when unfavorable news events can negatively impact a company.

However, in the long run, time evens out all volatility. 

In order to get the most out of long-term investments, investors should **focus on the corporate growth prospects, sectoral growth, and financial performances**, amongst other factors. 

## What are Long Term Stocks? 

As per the IRS, stocks are considered to be **capital assets**.

The  market value of stocks can rise or fall, without involving any taxes,  but once the investor decides to sell the stock, the IRS gets involved.

* **When you sell** your stock, you either have a **capital gain** or a **capital loss**, which depends upon *whether you sold your stock for more or less than what you bought it for*. 

There are different rates of taxes that apply in the short-term and long-term capital gains, which is why it is *crucial to keep track of your sale and purchase dates*.

## Holding Period

The capital gains are **classified** by the IRS on the stock transactions as either **short term or long term**, **depending on the length of time you have owned the stock for before the sale**.

If the stock is held for a *year or less before a sale*, then your gain or loss would be **short term**.

The sale transaction for a stock which has been *held for more than a year* results in a **long-term** capital gain or a loss.

# Difference Between Short Term and Long-term Investment

A **long-term investment** strategy means there is a *higher probability of maximizing your returns over a 10-year period*, as compared to a short-term investment strategy, which can bring profits in just a few years.

A **short-term investment** is usually *held for three years or less*.

* Examples of long-term investments are index funds, vehicles, etc.
* Examples of short-term investments are certificates of deposit, money market funds, etc.

Many investors like to **play** in the market and speculate **with their day trading**, but it is quite a **risky business**, and one has to be educated enough and do thorough research before they venture into short-term investments or trading.

* For most people, it is **safer and more comfortable to plan and have investments in long-term stocks**.

## Why You Should Hold Stocks for Long Term

Many financial experts suggest that **stocks should be held for the long term**.

There have been *losses* in the S&amp;P 500 indexes *in 10 years out of fifty* from 1975 to 2015, which makes stock market returns pretty volatile when it comes to the short term.

* Most of the investors have also experienced **better returns and greater success when they have held stocks for long**.

&amp;#x200B;

# Better Long-term Returns

If you look at **historical data** of asset class returns from the **past several decades**, it is easy to see that the **stocks have performed better than most other asset classes**.

* When considering an 87-year period from 1928 to 2015, the S&amp;P 500 has given a return of 9.5% per annum.
* This is compared to the 3.5% return from 3-month treasury bills and 5% return of 10-year treasury notes.

While the stock market performs better than other types of securities, the *risky assets generally do give higher returns than the less risky ones*.

**Long-term investments** are **preferred** because short-term fluctuations are usually there, which can be significant to make a tremendous impact on the returns.

The  small-cap generally give better returns on average while the  large-cap stocks provide lower returns and average around 9% per annum.

## Gives an Opportunity to Even Out the Highs and the Lows

Stocks are **usually considered as long-term investments**, and it is not unusual for stocks to drop 10-20% or sometimes even more in value over a shorter time frame.

&amp;#x200B;

*Over the period of many years*, sometimes even decades, **investors** have the opportunity to even out the high and the lows and **are able to generate better returns in the long run**.

Even  when one considers the stock returns over the years, it does suggest  that long-term investments yield positive results if they are given  enough time.

## Investors are Bad Market Timers

One of the flaws that investors have is that they have a tendency for being emotional.

*A lot of people claim to be long-term investors, until the market begins to fall*, which is when they end up **withdrawing their investment** in fear not to incur additional losses.

A  lot of the same investors fail to invest in stocks when a rebound  occurs and only jump back when the majority of their gains have been  achieved.

*This behavior of buying high and sell low ends up crippling the investor returns*.

* Most  investors pay too much attention to the stock market to reduce their  chances of success by timing the market frequently, while **a simple strategy of buy and hold would be able to give better returns.** 

## Lower Rate of Tax for Capital Gains

If  an investor sells his or her security within one year of purchasing it,  any capital gains that they earn on that security is treated as  ordinary income.

* It depends on the **individual's adjusted gross income**, which means the tax rate can be as high as 39.6%.

The *securities that are held for more than a year*, when they are sold, the gains are taxed at a **maximum rate of 20%**.

In fact, those investors who fall in a lower tax bracket can even qualify for a 0% long term capital gains tax.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,436804,public,self,Long Term Stocks for Long Term Profit,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dwnc8o/long_term_stocks_for_long_term_profit/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

Unless I am mis understanding how gold works it seems there is a some kind of instant deposit glitch going on with my account. For reference, Prior to making these deposits I have used $2316 of gold. 

I then made a transfer for $3500 and received only $500 of the instant deposit because I hit my 5K deposit limit from previous transfers. I was supposed to receive the remaining $3000 of those funds today but instead received an email saying the funds have been deposited but we’re used to cover a deficit in my account. 

I now have $152.45 of gold buying power in my account and $0 of my own money. No sign of the $3000 deposit.  It still says I have $2471.51 margin available with 2319.06 of margin used and 152.45 of buying power. 


Even if I was a bit below margin maintenance by a few hundred bucks this doesn’t mean the remaining 3k of my deposit would be put towards that right? Am I missing something here? What happened to my $3000? 

 
I emailed support. Support said the reason I didn’t receive the money was because I was given an instant deposit for it already (not true). I had to then take screenshots to show them I never got the instant deposits for my most recent transfer because I had already maxed my limit out. I replied to her with screenshots explaining that I maxed my instant deposits out and only got $500 of instant so I actually didn’t receive a full instant deposit for my last transfer. She still has not replied. Instead another agent replied to me saying it was because of the gold I used. How does this make any sense? If that’s the case shouldn’t my ”margin used” say $0 now? The app is still showing that I have $152.45 of gold buying power in my account and $0 of my deposit money. No sign of the $3000 deposit.  

It still says I have $2471.51 margin available with 2319.06 of margin used and 152.45 of buying power.

CAMPBELL, Calif., Nov. 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KULR) (the “Company” or “KULR”), a leading developer of battery safety and thermal management technologies, announced it will collaborate with a global Tier-1 power tool manufacturer on innovations that will improve motor speed while extending longevity in a new line of brushless DC motor (BLDC) products.  

When motors run they produce heat which can slow or drain the power transfer from the battery and wear down essential components. Reducing heat, by drawing it away from a source, can increase power transfer and help motors run faster and more efficiently for longer. To reduce the impact of heat and increase performance of their upcoming suite of high-performance BLDC power tools, this Tier-1 manufacturer plans to apply KULR’s proprietary Fiber Thermal Interface (FTI) technology in future beta models, after testing has been completed.
KULR’s FTI technology is a carbon fiber solution that is lightweight, flexible, has high bulk thermal conductivity, and extremely efficient at conducting heat. Variations of KULR’s FTI technology have been used by NASA on multiple missions to improve performance and reliability of sensitive electronics and other components.

“The trend in power tools is to draw more power and efficiency from existing battery designs, without adding to size or weight,” said Dr. Timothy Knowles, CTO of KULR. “We are helping the customer achieve these goals by employing the technology we developed for space applications and applying it to their BLDC power tool designs -- redirecting heat away from the coil winding, which allowed the motor to run faster for longer.” 

“Our outstanding line of cooling products extends beyond our battery heat sink TRS technologies. We aim to commercialize what we believe to be the best performing, lightweight thermal interface material (FTI) on earth and are working closely with world-class organizations to create cost-effective cooling solutions that improve their products,” said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR.

According to market analysts, the global brushless DC motor market size is expected to reach $71.9 billion in 2026, from $34.1 billion in 2018, growing at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2019 to 2026. In addition, the motor and power design efficiencies attained by KULR’s FTI technology have broad applications in other BLDC centric markets, such as industrial machinery, automotive, healthcare, and HVAC industries.

About KULR Technology Group, Inc.
KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KULR) develops, manufactures and licenses next-generation carbon fiber thermal management technologies for batteries and electronic systems. Leveraging the company’s roots in developing breakthrough cooling solutions for NASA deep space missions and backed by a strong intellectual property portfolio, KULR enables leading aerospace, electronics and electric vehicle manufacturers to make their products cooler, lighter and safer for the consumer.

My portfolio is now the same as it was at the beginning, I have no profit.

Yet, the Sharpe ratio, if I understand it correctly (based on [this explanation](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/sortino-ratio/), for example), should be:

(25% - RiskFreeRateOfReturn)/106%

Where 
 * 25% is an average of 100% and -50%

The monthly dividends are impressive and his constant reinvestments have his portfolio sitting around 350k right now.

So, do dividend growth strategies, or dividend aristocrat strategies beat the market consistently, or should I just put my side-hustle money into VUG as well.

I've never had any exposure to stocks and shares, but out of curiosity I logged into my People's Pension portfolio (UK Pension Scheme) I have my profile set to adventurous investment (B&amp;CE GIup to 100% shares)

When I first started paying in it says that B&amp;CE GI was in the 700s (I'm guessing this is the share cost?) Now it's up in the 1000s.

At first I thought that was good, but after thinking about it, doesn't that mean I'm getting less for my money and should switch to a safer profile?

Can anyone ELI5 what these figures mean?

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find what I needed, which was a real time strategy. This is when I went on youtube and typed ""daytrading strategies."" The idea obviously being to find someone more experienced who'd be willing to share their strategies. Tim sykes strategies are great and they appear to work, but they aren't for me. I stumbled on warrior. Now spending an extra $200 a month was kind of ridiculous, seeing as I've only made a few trades since following tim. I've been treating it like school where you get educated, get a degree, then work.

Since joining warrior last month, I've made a few successful trades and a few unsuccessful ones. Unfortunately, they didn't pan out like I expected. My emotions got the best of me, and I ended up losing on them. Circling back to warrior, he calls out his positions live, which is useful to see what his though process is and emulate it. I'm never quick enough to get my orders in. By the time I hear the call, I'm not able to fill the order fast enough. I usually use a market order, which allows a trader to get a quicker order. I've been reluctant to use stop orders.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find what I needed, which was a real time strategy. This is when I went on youtube and typed ""daytrading strategies."" The idea obviously being to find someone more experienced who'd be willing to share their strategies. Tim sykes strategies are great and they appear to work, but they aren't for me. I stumbled on warrior. Now spending an extra $200 a month was kind of ridiculous, seeing as I've only made a few trades since following tim. I've been treating it like school where you get educated, get a degree, then work.

Since joining warrior last month, I've made a few successful trades and a few unsuccessful ones. Unfortunately, they didn't pan out like I expected. My emotions got the best of me, and I ended up losing on them. Circling back to warrior, he calls out his positions live, which is useful to see what his though process is and emulate it. I'm never quick enough to get my orders in. By the time I hear the call, I'm not able to fill the order fast enough. I usually use a market order, which allows a trader to get a quicker order. I've been reluctant to use stop orders.

Hey everyone, i was curious, with such a variety of strategies and methods of valuation etc how the results would all pan out if put in a concise manner. Upon thinking about it i thought asking about strategies, returns etc would be quite invasive so the survey is entirely anonymous. I understand it is quite sparse as well but i wanted the survey to be relatively quick and have as few variables as possible.  
 I'm not overly sure if this breaches any rules on the forums, and as far as i have checked it seems that it is not.  
 Feel free to add any constructive criticism either on the survey itself or on this thread, or regarding the appropriateness of such a survey.  
 When i've received an appropriate range of results ill happily share my findings and any correlations, causes etc.

Being able to begin investing soon I thought it'd be interesting information to have, but it’s primarily being used for a finance assignment im working on at school so all submissions are incredibly helpful both to my knowledge and my grade 😊

That being said, I wanted to take one last opportunity to encourage you to research Disney on your own accord and to consider adding it to your portfolio or increasing your position.  Technical analysis demonstrates that Disney will perform well in both the short and long term and with the recent launch of Disney+, there has never been a better time to get in.

I have written about Disney before (maybe half a year ago) and since, I have seen over 20% returns.  I am circling back to this company because of two recent developments.  The first are the results of the most recent (Q4) financial statements.  Disney is spending less money than expected on developing Disney+.  On top of that, they beat revenues and EPS increased notably.  In short, Disney is spending less and making more money than analysts have predicted.  Much more than the recent 4% jump reflects.  

The second development (I'm sure you saw this one coming) is the release of Disney+.  But obviously the release has been priced in for a long time.  I am more so referring to the performance of the platform.  We have already seen that Disney+ is experiencing technical difficulties due to foot traffic that exceeded even Disney's highest expectations.  Note that last line.  That was said by Disney executives verbatim.  Disney has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure the launch went off without a hitch.  The only reason the site is malfunctioning is because of insane foot traffic.  That being said, I expect that by the end of the year, Disney will release subscriber numbers that will blow any analyst's expectations out of the water.  At that point, I expect Disney will not see the price point it has today for a long while.

Long story short, there are key indicators that Disney+ is already outperforming expectations.  The argument that this is already priced in is null and void because by definition, ""beats"" are in the moment and therefore, can not be priced in.  Disney's technical difficulties on release are a soft tell that early adopters will be higher than anyone expected.  I hope all of you at least look into the company and consider adding to your position.

hey do you know of the best site that can graph the market cap of multiple companies?

have been using http://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market_cap over time to see market cap but doesnt look like you can add other companies

- it's just to see how large and dominant a company is, or what relative size a startup is

- dont know if there's any good sites out there that makes this goal easier

- i keep this data on g sheets, along with glassdoor ratings, but it has gotten pretty pointless over time, since the largest companies always are top, and they switch places from time to time

i dont really update this sheet much, it's not actually that useful/helpful for anything, it's more a one time recurring over time

actually a more ideal site would be:

1. if you enter in a company

2. then it'd auto-populate popular and common companies on the graph/chart/grid with market cap that are relatively close to it,

3. so this way you can easily tell how large or what size around a company is (cos ofc it has helpful contextual info)

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Upon thinking about it i thought asking about strategies, returns etc would be quite invasive so the survey is entirely anonymous. I understand it is quite sparse as well but i wanted the survey to be relatively quick and have as few variables as possible.  
I'm not overly sure if this breaches any rules on the forums, and as far as i have checked it seems that it is not.  
Feel free to add any constructive criticism either on the survey itself or on this thread, or regarding the appropriateness of such a survey.  
When i've received an appropriate range of results ill happily share my findings and any correlations, causes etc.

First of all, sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. If it needs to be somewhere else, feel free to point me in the right direction :)

A little bit about me: I'm a 28 year old that wants to get into investing with the intent to save up for my retirement in hopefully 25 years from now. I've been reading up on investing and have decided that (for now), actively investing is probably not my cup of tea since it would at best be educated guesses instead of solid decisions. Hence my intent to focus mostly on ETF's.
However, I have a few questions regarding this and would be happy with all questions/insights.

- seeing as I'm only 28 and the focus is on the longterm, I figured that an accumulating ETF would be the best choice for me. I'm more interested in the end value than having this be an extra income for now. Is this correct?

- my intended split would be 50% in a worldwide etf, 40% in S&amp;P 500 ETF and last 10% in stocks once I get more comfortable with that. Does this sound reasonable or will the world etf and s&amp;p 500 overlap too much?

- my starting budget is 60k with the intent to add around 6-8k on a yearly basis. Would you recommend for the initial 60k to just buy the etf's all at once, or average down? In case of averaging, what time frame would you recommend?

- for the ETF'S, I'm a European. So if anyone has ticker codes for accumulating etf's as described above, feel free to link them :)

Especially scalping for a penny or two.  I’d never aim for only a cent or two profit margin, but it’s now possible.  This would seem to open up more opportunities for day trading.

Have you thought about what strategies you can adopt or change giving the new landscape?  I feel like there might be some “SOES bandit” type opportunities out there - cases where you can get in with an almost guaranteed stop for no loss, with a chance to ride a trend up if things go your way.

A round-trip trade used to cost me $10 - or a penny a share on 1,000 - and on a 100 shares - the savings is 10 cents apiece.  This would seem to make day trading of much higher priced stocks than I’ve typically traded quite feasible.

Also, buying no longer has to be done all at once.  Even for longer-term positions, breaking orders up into 100 share trades (as opposed to 1,000 - 2,000 shares) seems quite viable.

# **The market rally will soon be tested by a big Trump speech and testimony from the Fed chief  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/08/the-market-rally-will-soon-be-tested-by-a-big-trump-speech-and-testimony-from-the-fed-chief.html)**
*****
&gt; Progress in trade talks and a steady, but accomodative Fed policy have eased the way for the stock market’s rally to new highs, and both will be in the forefront when President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell speak at separate events in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Against a backdrop of a stabilizing global economy, stocks have hit new highs and bond yields have pushed higher, particularly in the past week with a 23 basis point surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year rose to end the week at 1.94%, its highest closing level since Aug. 1, the day Trump threatened another round of tariffs on China.
*****
&gt; Trump speaks to the Economic Club of New York during a Tuesday luncheon, and investors are hoping for clarity on a possible trade deal. The Fed chairman speaks Wednesday to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, and he also appears before the House Budget Committee Thursday.
*****
&gt; There are a few key economic reports, including CPI on Wednesday and retail sales and industrial production on Friday. Empire State manufacturing survey Friday could provide a fresh look at the manufacturing sector in the New York region. Just a few major earnings are expected in the week ahead, including Cisco Wednesday and Walmart and NVIDIA on Thursday.
*****
&gt; But trade is likely to remain the more important wild card for markets, as the calendar edges closer to Dec. 15, the date new tariffs on consumer goods from China would go into effect if there is no deal. The House of Representatives also hold impeachment hearings before the public for the first time in the coming week, but the markets have so far ignored the topic and see it unlikely that the Senate would convict the president.
*****
&gt; # Stock records
&gt; Stocks continued to rally to new highs this past week, and the major indices all ended the week at record levels, as bonds sold off hard. Stock market gains were limited part of the session Friday after Trump said that he has not agreed to the tariff rollbacks sought by China.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fifth week, up 0.9%, and is now up about 1.8% for November so far. The S&amp;P closed at 3,093 Friday.
*****
&gt; “President Trump is always unpredictable, so we’ll have to see what he says,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
&gt; Keon expects a trade agreement of some sort in the near future, and that should help risk markets to advance.
*****
&gt; “The way we’ve been interpreting this is it probably amounts to a truce. The United States has been using this rhetoric that it’s a phase one deal. China has not embraced the same rhetoric. So I don’t know if we’ll get major progress on the thornier issues in the first deal,” Keon said. “The other question is how hard does the president push in an election year to make further progress in the negotiations, given that China might dig in its heels? That’s unknowable. I have no insight into what the president is going to do.”
*****
&gt; Cowen policy strategist Chris Krueger said Trump’s address Tuesday could be important for the direction of a deal. “In our minds, the most critical sections will deal with trade and whether Trump is favoring the “phase one” deal with China and a scheduled rollback of the tariffs. This could well be a trial balloon to gauge the ferocity of expected pushback from influential China hawks. Trump will give remarks and then take questions from two moderators,” wrote Krueger.
*****
&gt; Powell’s testimony is not expected to have as much potential to rock markets, after the clear message he sent to markets following the Fed’s rate cut Oct. 30.
*****
&gt; “I would expect the chairman to continue the rhetoric he had at his last press conference. They’re probably on hold. It will depend on the data. If anything the data looks a little more promising on the margin. Certainly the consumer and service sector appear to be doing fine and with the GM strike ending, some of the things impacted by that should improve,” said Keon. “They think rates are appropriate for now, and if the economy weakens, they’ll be prepared to take further action.”
*****
&gt; The health of the global economy has been a topic of concern in markets for months, but with the global rise in yields and signs of improvement in global PMI data, investors have clearly become more optimistic.
*****
&gt; “I’ve been kind of skeptical most of the year, but I do think at the margin, the economic outlook has improved, especially outside the United States,” said Keon. “The recession talk that was pretty active just a month or two ago has really died down. The yield curve is dramatically uninverted. I feel a little better about the economic outlook.”
*****
&gt; When the yield curve becomes inverted, short term rates, like the 2-year note yield for instance, rise above the long end, or the 10-year yield. That is very often a recession warning, as investors bet that the economy will be weaker in the longer term than it is in the near term. But there’s been a sudden shift, and now those curves are getting steeper.
*****
&gt; Keon said the higher yields are a positive sign, and he is adding to stock holdings, but more in foreign names. “The sense Europe was heading into a recession has died off, and there are signs things are stabilizing,” he said. “This could all change in a minute but it looks like the overall outlook has significantly picked up in the last month or two.”
*****
&gt; Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he is still cautious about the improvement, though earnings were not as bad as expected, the Fed has cut rates and the trade situation appears to be improving. “That combined with green shoots on the macro front, the markets have really taken that and run with it,” he said, adding the move may have been too optimistic. “It’s out-sized relative to the significance of the data.”
*****
&gt; Suzuki said he needs to see more proof that U.S. manufacturing has stabilized, as many believe. ISM manufacturing was better in October than in September, but it is still in contraction. “Why is this definitely the bottom? The jury’s still out,” he said.
*****
&gt; “I think you have to answer the question—if this is the bottom and growth is going to rebound here, what’s going to be the catalyst for that?...I don’t see anything in the data that suggests there’s going to be a big rebound for any of those fronts. I see more headwinds to growth than I see tail winds,” he said. “On the investment side, it would be highly unusual to see a big rebo

# November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Best

&gt; DJIA has been up 10 of the last 15 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 13 of the last 17 years with an average gain of 0.45%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 16 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 15 and 14 times respectively over the past 25 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the usually bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

# S&amp;P 500 Price vs 50-DMA

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been on a seemingly uninterrupted run higher over the last several days, but by some measures, it may not be as extended as you would think. The chart below shows the historical percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500 and its 50-day moving average (DMA) over the last three years. Through Thursday's close, the S&amp;P 500 was 3.2% above its 50-DMA, which is relatively high but nowhere near an extreme. The red line in the chart below shows the current percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500's price and its 50-DMA. There have been a number of times since the 2016 election where this spread was higher with the most recent being back in July. In fact, 17% of all prior days in the last three years have seen the S&amp;P 500 close at a higher level relative to its 50-DMA than it is now. That doesn't mean the market isn't overbought, but it's not exactly at unprecedented levels either.

# Leaders and Laggards Since FOMC

&gt; We've now had nearly a full week of trading since last Wednesday's FOMC meeting where Fed Chair Powell suggested that the punch bowl isn't going to be taken away anytime soon. During that time, we've seen a real shift in leadership as defensive sectors have sold off while cyclical sectors have been on fire. Energy - yes, Energy - has been the top-performing sector with a gain of 3.5% while Industrials aren't far behind with a gain of 2.8%, Behind these two, Technology and Financials have also comfortably outperformed the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.2%. On the downside, Real Estate and Utilities, two of the market's most popular sectors for much of 2019 due to their dividend yields, have both dropped over 1% while Consumer Staples and Health Care have also sold off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC.png))**

&gt; Due to the fact that we are also in the thick of earnings season, it's a bit more difficult to see how the Fed's actions last week impacted individual stocks as some of the best and worst performances over the last week have been earnings-related. With that caveat, the tables below list the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the last week. Starting off with the winners, three S&amp;P 500 stocks are up over 20% in the last week, and all three were due to earnings reports. Overall, 12 stocks have rallied over 10%, while all 25 of the top performers are up over 7%. In terms of sector representation on the list, nearly a third (8) of the stocks on the list are from the Technology sector, while another five come from the Consumer Discretionary sector. The remaining 12 stocks on the list come from five different sectors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC-Stocks.png))**

&gt; On the downside, 8 of the 25 worst performers since last week's FOMC meeting are down over 10% with Arista Networks (ANET) losing nearly a quarter of its value. Again, ANET's decline was tied to an earnings report as opposed to a reaction to the FOMC. In terms of overall sector representation, though, the underperformance of the Real Estate sector highlighted above is also evident on this list as eight of the companies listed come from that sector.

# The Few, the Lowly, the Laggards

&gt; With less than two months left to go in 2019, the S&amp;P 500 is sitting on a gain of nearly 23% YTD, and all but two of the index's 24 industry groups are up by at least double-digit percentages. The two laggards are Energy (+4.5%) and Drugs and Biotechs (+5.5%), while the three strongest groups are all from the Technology sector (Tech Hardware: +44.8%, Semis: +37.7%, and Software: +32.8%). Surprisingly enough, Banks are even starting to move up the performance list as that group is up just a hair under 30% on the year putting it in fifth place on a YTD basis.

&gt; The table below lists where each of the S&amp;P 500's Industry Groups is currently trading with respect to its 50-DMA. While you would expect just about everything to be extended after the recent leg higher, that's not the case. The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is just 3% above its 50-DMA, and just five groups are more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. The two most extended groups are Tech Hardware (think Apple) and Banks. On the downside, there are actually as many Industry Groups trading below their 50-DMAs as there are groups trading more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. As shown at the bottom of the table, Consumer Services, Real Estate, Household &amp; Personal Products, Commercial Services, and Utilities are all currently below their 50-DMAs. These aren't groups that have been lagging the market all year. In fact, three of them are outperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, but in the majority of cases, these are defensive-oriented groups that have fallen out of favor as the market's sentiment has shifted and rates have risen.

# Seasonally Strong Period, But…

&gt; As I head to Las Vegas for my annual pilgrimage to @MoneyShows TradersEXPO I am both thrilled and shocked to hear everybody on Wall Street and the financial media talking about bullish yearend market seasonality and practically every one of them has used the phrase, “seasonally strong period.”

&gt; I’m thrilled because it validates what we already know and what I live and breathe: that there are clear evidence-based results of real, consistent, tradable and investable seasonal market patterns. I am shocked at how late many of them are to the party. We’ve been in bullish Best Six Months mode since our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on October 11.

&gt; Since our October 11 Buy Signal we have tactically maneuvered out of our defensive positions in Bonds, Cyclicals, Utilities and others and into the main U.S. equity index ETFs: DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM and the gamut of seasonally strong growth sectors over three weeks ago. We also put out a brand new Stock Basket of undervalued growth stocks under Wall Street’s radar.

&gt; Market seasonality is clearly firing on all pistons as it has been all year, but everyone’s is jumping on the seasonal bandwagon just a two regular seasonal soft patches are about to come around on the calendar. Now that our Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy is complete with some big market gains at the end of October and the beginning of November we are on the lookout for weakness ahead of Thanksgiving.

&gt; Next week is two weeks before Thanksgiving and we’ve shown in several recent posts, it is part of the mid-November soft patch. Then stocks usually pick up in anticipation of Thanksgiving and continue to rally through the end of November. After thanksgiving watch out, the first couple weeks of December are notoriously choppy and not especially bullish as tax-loss selling kicks into high gear.

&gt; With the market elevated and the news ever changing, stocks will be vulnerable to these perennial weak spots.

# Presidential Cycle Stars Align for Stocks in 2020

&gt; Despite all of the geopolitical events, things still look good for stocks next year with an incumbent running. The potential for a decent trade truce with China, along with an economy that’s still growing and accommodative interest rates add up to a continuation of the bull market.

&gt; With the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 coming off the press this week here’s a little preview of some our analysis and outlook that’s in the 53rd Annual Edition.

&gt; Presidential incumbency is a powerful phenomenon and the driving force behind the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle. This quadrennial quadrille is what has made the Pre-Election Year the best year of the cycle and Election Year second best. Since 1952 S&amp;P 500 is up 12.5% on average in election years when a sitting president is running for reelection vs. 6.7% in all election years and –1.5% in election years with an open field and no incumbent commander-in-chief running for a second term.

&gt; We are also arguably now experiencing some fiscal and monetary policy synchronicity. After several years of conflicting policy the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Federal government are finally getting in synch. Interest rates are historically low and the Fed has lowered rates again at the last three scheduled FOMC meetings at the same time as fiscal policy has been lowering taxes and increasing spending. These dual pro-growth policies should continue to propel the stock market higher.

&gt; Gains will of course not come without pause and correction. The world stage will continue to feature some challenging geopolitical, political, diplomatic, trade-related and economic storylines. U.S. presidential campaign politics will increasingly focus on domestic political disputes, standoffs and unfinished business – as well as impeachment proceedings. But when all is said and done, we expect 2020 to be a positive year based on the historical patterns and cycles and current favorable policies, healthy economics, and positive market behavior.

# Pre-Election Year Patterns: A November Market Pause

&gt; Now that we’ve survived Octoberphobia and the market has begun to strengthen again, breaking out above resistance and logging new highs on DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we are likely to experience a bit of consolidation here in November. Normally the top S&amp;P month of the year and #2 for DJIA, NASDAQ and the Russell 2000, November has been weaker in Pre-Election Years.

&gt; As you can see in the updated chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns overlaid with 2019 we have been tracking all year November tends to be flat in the Pre-Election Year with a pop around Thanksgiving. Then after the usual first half of December softness the market tends to push toward additional new highs near yearend. Considering the banner performance so far this year and the uncanny tracking of this historical seasonal pattern, we expect the stock to consolidate over the next few weeks and then resume its march higher.

# Bulls Stay in Motion

&gt; “An object in motion tends to remain in motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force.” Sir Isaac Newton

&gt; What a year it has been for the bulls. The S&amp;P 500 Index recently made four more new highs, and it’s up more than 20% for the year (as of Nov. 4). This leads to the big question: What could happen in the final two months of 2019? Well, we think the bulls might like it.

&gt; “A good year tends to see continued strong performance the final two months of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up 20% or more for the year heading into the usually bullish November, stocks have never dropped in November, while December also has tended to see a strong upward bias.”

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the day shows, going back to 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 20% heading into November, then the final two months were up an average of 6.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has also never fallen in the final two months of the year after closing October up more than 20% for the year.

&gt; This phenomenon could be due to portfolio managers buying to play catch-up, or it could be that an object in motion stays in motion, as Newton noted more than 300 years ago.

I have no positions in defense nor gov't contractors and want to expose my portfolio to defense and aerospace.

I like UTX because of their diversification as far as contracts go, subcontracting with companies like LMT and BA. I also like them for their planned merger with RTN.

Stock market rookie. dabbled in acb and the rest of the canadian market when it blew up and got somewhat lucky but couldnt handle the day to day stress. now i’m back and ready to do it right with a diverse portfolio. i took 20k of my savings and put it back into fidelity and i plan to add more as the months go on. last week i bought:

42% in the VT world stock index. 

18% in CPRT

14% in MSFT

6.5% in JNJ


2.8% in PG. ( i’m going to increase this when my cash settles)

i bought 14% disney at 131 and sold it at 135 yesterday as an almost retired coworker who’s been in the market for his whole life showed me how to read charts and when to buy and sell based on moving averages and all that jazz. not saying i’m an expert now and as always you can’t really predict everything but, according to the chart facts disney was a sell so i sold it with my 5% win. 

I will be putting a small portion back into ACB as it looks like it’s bottomed out for the most part back to where it was before all this stuff blew up. 
 
I think i want to further diversify into maybe 10-12 stocks based on what i read, but also having 42% in VT sorta does that in its own yes?

Any info would be appreciated, i’m very mobile and can monitor and buy/sell as markets move but i’m in it for the long haul. 15.5 years left to go in the air force and with my future pension i want to retire early and just chill in a surf shop til it’s time.

5 minute chart for Boeing (BA). Why are there volume spikes at these strange times?

BA - 5 minute chart volume spikes 
10/31 - 4:55pm
11/01 - 4:55pm
11/04 - 3:55pm
11/05 - 3:55pm
11/06 - 3:55pm

On many stocks, a large volume spike on 5 minute charts are very reliable indicators of upcoming uptrends (or downtrends).

But why do they happen at these consistently strange hours?

Why does this happen? It has to be institutional buying right?

More:
FCX - 5 minute chart volume spikes  
10/31 - 7:30pm
11/01 - 4:55pm
11/04 - 3:55pm
11/05 - 3:55pm 
11/06 - 6:30pm

CTL- 5 minute chart volume spikes 
10/31 - 7:30pm
11/01 - No significant volume spike
11/04 - 6:30pm
11/05 - 6:30pm
11/06 - 6:30

AAPL - 5 minute chart volume spikes 
10/31 - 4:55pm
11/01 - 4:55pm
11/04 - 3:55pm
11/05 - 3:55pm
11/06 - 3:55pm

There are many many more of course. 

On these stocks if there is a GREEN SPIKE and you buy at open and sell at 9:34 you win it appears to be up most of the time...

Am I missing something glaringly obvious here?

Another question: As I understand it the volume spikes are green or red depending on whether selling was higher or lower but not by how much. For example if it was 51% selling and 49% buying the bar would still be red.

# **The market rally will soon be tested by a big Trump speech and testimony from the Fed chief  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/08/the-market-rally-will-soon-be-tested-by-a-big-trump-speech-and-testimony-from-the-fed-chief.html)**
*****
&gt; Progress in trade talks and a steady, but accomodative Fed policy have eased the way for the stock market’s rally to new highs, and both will be in the forefront when President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell speak at separate events in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Against a backdrop of a stabilizing global economy, stocks have hit new highs and bond yields have pushed higher, particularly in the past week with a 23 basis point surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year rose to end the week at 1.94%, its highest closing level since Aug. 1, the day Trump threatened another round of tariffs on China.
*****
&gt; Trump speaks to the Economic Club of New York during a Tuesday luncheon, and investors are hoping for clarity on a possible trade deal. The Fed chairman speaks Wednesday to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, and he also appears before the House Budget Committee Thursday.
*****
&gt; There are a few key economic reports, including CPI on Wednesday and retail sales and industrial production on Friday. Empire State manufacturing survey Friday could provide a fresh look at the manufacturing sector in the New York region. Just a few major earnings are expected in the week ahead, including Cisco Wednesday and Walmart and NVIDIA on Thursday.
*****
&gt; But trade is likely to remain the more important wild card for markets, as the calendar edges closer to Dec. 15, the date new tariffs on consumer goods from China would go into effect if there is no deal. The House of Representatives also hold impeachment hearings before the public for the first time in the coming week, but the markets have so far ignored the topic and see it unlikely that the Senate would convict the president.
*****
&gt; # Stock records
&gt; Stocks continued to rally to new highs this past week, and the major indices all ended the week at record levels, as bonds sold off hard. Stock market gains were limited part of the session Friday after Trump said that he has not agreed to the tariff rollbacks sought by China.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fifth week, up 0.9%, and is now up about 1.8% for November so far. The S&amp;P closed at 3,093 Friday.
*****
&gt; “President Trump is always unpredictable, so we’ll have to see what he says,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
&gt; Keon expects a trade agreement of some sort in the near future, and that should help risk markets to advance.
*****
&gt; “The way we’ve been interpreting this is it probably amounts to a truce. The United States has been using this rhetoric that it’s a phase one deal. China has not embraced the same rhetoric. So I don’t know if we’ll get major progress on the thornier issues in the first deal,” Keon said. “The other question is how hard does the president push in an election year to make further progress in the negotiations, given that China might dig in its heels? That’s unknowable. I have no insight into what the president is going to do.”
*****
&gt; Cowen policy strategist Chris Krueger said Trump’s address Tuesday could be important for the direction of a deal. “In our minds, the most critical sections will deal with trade and whether Trump is favoring the “phase one” deal with China and a scheduled rollback of the tariffs. This could well be a trial balloon to gauge the ferocity of expected pushback from influential China hawks. Trump will give remarks and then take questions from two moderators,” wrote Krueger.
*****
&gt; Powell’s testimony is not expected to have as much potential to rock markets, after the clear message he sent to markets following the Fed’s rate cut Oct. 30.
*****
&gt; “I would expect the chairman to continue the rhetoric he had at his last press conference. They’re probably on hold. It will depend on the data. If anything the data looks a little more promising on the margin. Certainly the consumer and service sector appear to be doing fine and with the GM strike ending, some of the things impacted by that should improve,” said Keon. “They think rates are appropriate for now, and if the economy weakens, they’ll be prepared to take further action.”
*****
&gt; The health of the global economy has been a topic of concern in markets for months, but with the global rise in yields and signs of improvement in global PMI data, investors have clearly become more optimistic.
*****
&gt; “I’ve been kind of skeptical most of the year, but I do think at the margin, the economic outlook has improved, especially outside the United States,” said Keon. “The recession talk that was pretty active just a month or two ago has really died down. The yield curve is dramatically uninverted. I feel a little better about the economic outlook.”
*****
&gt; When the yield curve becomes inverted, short term rates, like the 2-year note yield for instance, rise above the long end, or the 10-year yield. That is very often a recession warning, as investors bet that the economy will be weaker in the longer term than it is in the near term. But there’s been a sudden shift, and now those curves are getting steeper.
*****
&gt; Keon said the higher yields are a positive sign, and he is adding to stock holdings, but more in foreign names. “The sense Europe was heading into a recession has died off, and there are signs things are stabilizing,” he said. “This could all change in a minute but it looks like the overall outlook has significantly picked up in the last month or two.”
*****
&gt; Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he is still cautious about the improvement, though earnings were not as bad as expected, the Fed has cut rates and the trade situation appears to be improving. “That combined with green shoots on the macro front, the markets have really taken that and run with it,” he said, adding the move may have been too optimistic. “It’s out-sized relative to the significance of the data.”
*****
&gt; Suzuki said he needs to see more proof that U.S. manufacturing has stabilized, as many believe. ISM manufacturing was better in October than in September, but it is still in contraction. “Why is this definitely the bottom? The jury’s still out,” he said.
*****
&gt; “I think you have to answer the question—if this is the bottom and growth is going to rebound here, what’s going to be the catalyst for that?...I don’t see anything in the data that suggests there’s going to be a big rebound for any of those fronts. I see more headwinds to growth than I see tail winds,” he said. “On the investment side, it would be highly unusual to see a big rebo

# November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Best

&gt; DJIA has been up 10 of the last 15 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 13 of the last 17 years with an average gain of 0.45%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 16 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 15 and 14 times respectively over the past 25 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the usually bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

# S&amp;P 500 Price vs 50-DMA

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been on a seemingly uninterrupted run higher over the last several days, but by some measures, it may not be as extended as you would think. The chart below shows the historical percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500 and its 50-day moving average (DMA) over the last three years. Through Thursday's close, the S&amp;P 500 was 3.2% above its 50-DMA, which is relatively high but nowhere near an extreme. The red line in the chart below shows the current percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500's price and its 50-DMA. There have been a number of times since the 2016 election where this spread was higher with the most recent being back in July. In fact, 17% of all prior days in the last three years have seen the S&amp;P 500 close at a higher level relative to its 50-DMA than it is now. That doesn't mean the market isn't overbought, but it's not exactly at unprecedented levels either.

# Leaders and Laggards Since FOMC

&gt; We've now had nearly a full week of trading since last Wednesday's FOMC meeting where Fed Chair Powell suggested that the punch bowl isn't going to be taken away anytime soon. During that time, we've seen a real shift in leadership as defensive sectors have sold off while cyclical sectors have been on fire. Energy - yes, Energy - has been the top-performing sector with a gain of 3.5% while Industrials aren't far behind with a gain of 2.8%, Behind these two, Technology and Financials have also comfortably outperformed the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.2%. On the downside, Real Estate and Utilities, two of the market's most popular sectors for much of 2019 due to their dividend yields, have both dropped over 1% while Consumer Staples and Health Care have also sold off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC.png))**

&gt; Due to the fact that we are also in the thick of earnings season, it's a bit more difficult to see how the Fed's actions last week impacted individual stocks as some of the best and worst performances over the last week have been earnings-related. With that caveat, the tables below list the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the last week. Starting off with the winners, three S&amp;P 500 stocks are up over 20% in the last week, and all three were due to earnings reports. Overall, 12 stocks have rallied over 10%, while all 25 of the top performers are up over 7%. In terms of sector representation on the list, nearly a third (8) of the stocks on the list are from the Technology sector, while another five come from the Consumer Discretionary sector. The remaining 12 stocks on the list come from five different sectors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC-Stocks.png))**

&gt; On the downside, 8 of the 25 worst performers since last week's FOMC meeting are down over 10% with Arista Networks (ANET) losing nearly a quarter of its value. Again, ANET's decline was tied to an earnings report as opposed to a reaction to the FOMC. In terms of overall sector representation, though, the underperformance of the Real Estate sector highlighted above is also evident on this list as eight of the companies listed come from that sector.

# The Few, the Lowly, the Laggards

&gt; With less than two months left to go in 2019, the S&amp;P 500 is sitting on a gain of nearly 23% YTD, and all but two of the index's 24 industry groups are up by at least double-digit percentages. The two laggards are Energy (+4.5%) and Drugs and Biotechs (+5.5%), while the three strongest groups are all from the Technology sector (Tech Hardware: +44.8%, Semis: +37.7%, and Software: +32.8%). Surprisingly enough, Banks are even starting to move up the performance list as that group is up just a hair under 30% on the year putting it in fifth place on a YTD basis.

&gt; The table below lists where each of the S&amp;P 500's Industry Groups is currently trading with respect to its 50-DMA. While you would expect just about everything to be extended after the recent leg higher, that's not the case. The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is just 3% above its 50-DMA, and just five groups are more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. The two most extended groups are Tech Hardware (think Apple) and Banks. On the downside, there are actually as many Industry Groups trading below their 50-DMAs as there are groups trading more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. As shown at the bottom of the table, Consumer Services, Real Estate, Household &amp; Personal Products, Commercial Services, and Utilities are all currently below their 50-DMAs. These aren't groups that have been lagging the market all year. In fact, three of them are outperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, but in the majority of cases, these are defensive-oriented groups that have fallen out of favor as the market's sentiment has shifted and rates have risen.

# Seasonally Strong Period, But…

&gt; As I head to Las Vegas for my annual pilgrimage to @MoneyShows TradersEXPO I am both thrilled and shocked to hear everybody on Wall Street and the financial media talking about bullish yearend market seasonality and practically every one of them has used the phrase, “seasonally strong period.”

&gt; I’m thrilled because it validates what we already know and what I live and breathe: that there are clear evidence-based results of real, consistent, tradable and investable seasonal market patterns. I am shocked at how late many of them are to the party. We’ve been in bullish Best Six Months mode since our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on October 11.

&gt; Since our October 11 Buy Signal we have tactically maneuvered out of our defensive positions in Bonds, Cyclicals, Utilities and others and into the main U.S. equity index ETFs: DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM and the gamut of seasonally strong growth sectors over three weeks ago. We also put out a brand new Stock Basket of undervalued growth stocks under Wall Street’s radar.

&gt; Market seasonality is clearly firing on all pistons as it has been all year, but everyone’s is jumping on the seasonal bandwagon just a two regular seasonal soft patches are about to come around on the calendar. Now that our Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy is complete with some big market gains at the end of October and the beginning of November we are on the lookout for weakness ahead of Thanksgiving.

&gt; Next week is two weeks before Thanksgiving and we’ve shown in several recent posts, it is part of the mid-November soft patch. Then stocks usually pick up in anticipation of Thanksgiving and continue to rally through the end of November. After thanksgiving watch out, the first couple weeks of December are notoriously choppy and not especially bullish as tax-loss selling kicks into high gear.

&gt; With the market elevated and the news ever changing, stocks will be vulnerable to these perennial weak spots.

# Presidential Cycle Stars Align for Stocks in 2020

&gt; Despite all of the geopolitical events, things still look good for stocks next year with an incumbent running. The potential for a decent trade truce with China, along with an economy that’s still growing and accommodative interest rates add up to a continuation of the bull market.

&gt; With the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 coming off the press this week here’s a little preview of some our analysis and outlook that’s in the 53rd Annual Edition.

&gt; Presidential incumbency is a powerful phenomenon and the driving force behind the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle. This quadrennial quadrille is what has made the Pre-Election Year the best year of the cycle and Election Year second best. Since 1952 S&amp;P 500 is up 12.5% on average in election years when a sitting president is running for reelection vs. 6.7% in all election years and –1.5% in election years with an open field and no incumbent commander-in-chief running for a second term.

&gt; We are also arguably now experiencing some fiscal and monetary policy synchronicity. After several years of conflicting policy the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Federal government are finally getting in synch. Interest rates are historically low and the Fed has lowered rates again at the last three scheduled FOMC meetings at the same time as fiscal policy has been lowering taxes and increasing spending. These dual pro-growth policies should continue to propel the stock market higher.

&gt; Gains will of course not come without pause and correction. The world stage will continue to feature some challenging geopolitical, political, diplomatic, trade-related and economic storylines. U.S. presidential campaign politics will increasingly focus on domestic political disputes, standoffs and unfinished business – as well as impeachment proceedings. But when all is said and done, we expect 2020 to be a positive year based on the historical patterns and cycles and current favorable policies, healthy economics, and positive market behavior.

# Pre-Election Year Patterns: A November Market Pause

&gt; Now that we’ve survived Octoberphobia and the market has begun to strengthen again, breaking out above resistance and logging new highs on DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we are likely to experience a bit of consolidation here in November. Normally the top S&amp;P month of the year and #2 for DJIA, NASDAQ and the Russell 2000, November has been weaker in Pre-Election Years.

&gt; As you can see in the updated chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns overlaid with 2019 we have been tracking all year November tends to be flat in the Pre-Election Year with a pop around Thanksgiving. Then after the usual first half of December softness the market tends to push toward additional new highs near yearend. Considering the banner performance so far this year and the uncanny tracking of this historical seasonal pattern, we expect the stock to consolidate over the next few weeks and then resume its march higher.

# Bulls Stay in Motion

&gt; “An object in motion tends to remain in motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force.” Sir Isaac Newton

&gt; What a year it has been for the bulls. The S&amp;P 500 Index recently made four more new highs, and it’s up more than 20% for the year (as of Nov. 4). This leads to the big question: What could happen in the final two months of 2019? Well, we think the bulls might like it.

&gt; “A good year tends to see continued strong performance the final two months of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up 20% or more for the year heading into the usually bullish November, stocks have never dropped in November, while December also has tended to see a strong upward bias.”

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the day shows, going back to 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 20% heading into November, then the final two months were up an average of 6.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has also never fallen in the final two months of the year after closing October up more than 20% for the year.

&gt; This phenomenon could be due to portfolio managers buying to play catch-up, or it could be that an object in motion stays in motion, as Newton noted more than 300 years ago.

[],False,InterestingNews1,,[],,text,t2_uipg9,False,[],False,False,1573302067,self.stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dtv9bi/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/,{},dtv9bi,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,,dark,text,False,False,True,28,0,False,all_ads,/r/stocks/comments/dtv9bi/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/,False,6,,1573302069,1,"Lots more news this week with earnings season still in full swing as well as a few other controversial developments. As usual I am going to start with the large caps before moving on to smaller companies and have tried to categorize them as much as possible for those who prefer to dip in and out. 

The week kicked off on Monday with the rebranding of **Facebook** as FACEBOOK which was seen by some as an attempt to distinguish the app from the company and by others (of a more cynical nature) as an attempt to deflect attention during a time of regulatory scrutiny. However, if that was the case, Facebook need not have bothered as plenty of distraction was caused by the termination of **McDonald’s** CEO position for a romantic encounter with a subordinate and the announcement by **Under Armour** that their accounting practices were under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Elsewhere, **Xerox** launched a bold bid to acquire HP Inc, a company three times its size, for $22 (a premium of 37% above where the stock traded a month ago) split 77% cash and 23% stock in a transaction that would still leave HPQ shareholders in control of 48% of the company. Xerox has identified potential synergies totalling $2 billion, a meaningful amount for a group with a combined market capitalisation of $36.3 billion.  However, synergies often fail to materialise and with both entities facing secular decline it seems like a mistake, to put it mildly, to propose a $28 billion cash payment that will be funded primarily by debt.

On Monday **Ferrari** saw its stock jump 6% after reporting a strong beat and raise along with announcing a planned collaboration with Armani. It is an attempt to transform Ferrari into a fully fledged luxury brand and away from the sun glasses and polo tops that are currently diluting its top end aspirations. Easier said than done.  The stock later gave back most of Monday’s gains but finished the week still trading on an earnings multiple of 37. That’s a big premium for an auto company even if consensus forecasts point to 15% annual growth. 

**Square** jumped 5% on Thursday after reporting strong Q3 sales growth of 43% and a 42% increase in gross profits. The stock is still down 35% from its 2018 peak due to concerns about a lack of profitability and increasing competition. Nevertheless investors were cheered by Wednesday’s print.  

Square’s stock had  dropped in August after guidance for adjusted revenue fell short of analyst expectations of $599 million. Q3’s result did beat those with adjusted revenue of $602 million and shows that Square continues to grow revenue at an impressive rate in a total addressable market that is estimated (in the US alone) at almost 30x current GPV/revenues.  Additionally Square has yet to enter significant markets abroad. There are over 125 million businesses around the world that can potentially use Square’s services, so the company's growth has the potential to accelerate once it targets international expansion. The current valuation of $26 billion looks reasonable at 6.5x sales.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Everbridge,**  **Everquote, RealReal, and Chegg)** 

There were a number of high quality growth stocks reporting this week. They didn’t disappoint with rapid revenue growth in huge target markets. However profitability was generally notable by its absence and valuations were sky high. Unfortunately, that is the price you have to pay today to own these disruptor stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

First up, **Everbridge** reported a beat on Monday with revenue growth of 35%, a sharp drop in losses and was named “Growth Company of the Year” by Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council.

The company is the go to provider of critical event management (i.e. how organisations respond to events such as terrorist attacks, shooters or extreme weather) with global reach and includes most of the world’s largest companies and organizations as customers. That in itself, along with 150+ patents, is a competitive advantage. Growth has been strong and retention rates excellent at 110%. Significantly customers have demonstrated a reluctance to change provider once on boarded.

Everbridge’s valuation is high (very high), at $3 billion it is about 15x current year estimated sales. However, compared to its TAM of $40 billion it looks justifiable. Additionally, with three quarters of revenues from the US, there is the real opportunity for international growth. Specifically, the EU has mandated that all member states must have alerting services in place over the next few years. Deployment across the 27 members expected over the next 18 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday **Everquote**, an insurance comparison website, shot up 30% after reporting a 61% year on year revenue increase and 81% yoy increase in quote requests. Everquote is priced on a more reasonable price to sales ratio of 4x current year estimates. That’s probably due to the company facing numerous competitors from other comparison websites. Nevertheless with a market capitalization of $12 billion compared to an estimated TAM of $120 billion there is still plenty of room for growth and the company’s offering is clearly resonating with customers. Additionally the company reported strong growth in property and health insurance which offers a profitable add-on service for Everquote as well as diversification from its current concentration in auto insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

The **RealReal** (the leading online marketplace for designer clothing, fine jewellery, watches, fine art and home decor) reported strong results on Monday with sales up 55% but the stock price was hit by a CNBC report on negative customer reviews and counterfeit merchandise.  It ended the week down 25% with a market capitalization of $1.3 billion.

That valuation (4x sales) looks cheap compared to growth and outlook. RealReal offers a marketplace for luxury items that has resonated with younger customers who see the value opportunity of owning luxury goods for just a short time while also appreciating the ethical aspects of recycling.

The company has responded to claims of fake merchandise quickly. Its processes are industry leading and, at the end of the day, it offers a guarantee for authenticity so customers should be reassured. Consequently I would expect this scandal to pass quickly and the strong tail winds that are driving this industry will push the stock significantly higher.

The risk is that the company has been seriously negligent on authentication in its rush for growth and that there is a wave of bad news waiting to come out. If that is the case, then its reputation is ruined. However the bottom line for me is that the total addressable market for luxury goods in the US is massive at $198 billion. That means the risk return still looks favourable with RealReal in the early stages of growth. The potential downside is (as always) 100% but that compares to huge potential upside given the current gross merchandise volume of just $1 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chegg** (online textbook and tutoring services) also reported strong results with revenues up 28% and raised guidance. Over the past 30 years, textbook prices have increased 812% and in the same time, the average tuition fee has increased 559%. In an attempt to help students cope with this financial burden, Chegg offers the rental of both physical and digital textbooks. The stock jumped 14% in response to the print and now trades on a PE of 42x and PS 10x. That is another pricey multiple but Chegg still looks interesting because;

1. Fat gross profit margins

2. Moat provided by huge supply of over 25 million answered questions and 5million textbooks. This massive supply of premium content is hard to replicate for most entrants.

3. Huge potential for growth with business so far catering for just 2.2 million out of a total of 36 million students

4. Highly scalable business with profits expected to rise exponentially as sales increase

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks (Air Lease and WW International)**

**Air Lease** (aircraft leasing) reported Q3 earnings on Wednesday with revenues up 19.4% and earnings up 9.2%. The company said that despite meaningful delays from both Boeing and Airbus the company plans a 25% year-over-year fleet value expansion and strong growth is expected to continue with 316 aircraft on the order books. Additionally, it was able to report that all aircraft previously leased to (now defunct) Thomas Cook have been profitably placed with new airline customers.

Like most aircraft leasing companies, Air Lease trades on a very attractive trailing PE of 9.3 despite strong historic and forecast growth. However what sets Air Lease apart from the others is its CEO, Steven Udvar-Hazy, a pioneer in airline leasing with over 40 years of experience. In 1973, he co-founded the aircraft leasing business International Lease Finance Corporation (now AerCap) and led ILFC as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until his departure in 2010 to launch Air Lease.

Air Lease has grown steadily over the past 10 years and tailwinds from rising global incomes and demand for more efficient aircraft are boosting strong order books. Air Lease wil probably never trade on a big premium but with historic and forecast CAGR of 17% it can still provide a good return for investors.

&amp;#x200B;

**WW International** (Weight Watchers) dropped 20% on Wednesday after reporting revenue of $348.6 million for the quarter, down from $365.8 million last year and missing guidance for $353.0 million. However WW is expecting a few things to help drive revenue in the coming months and raised full year guidance. Product sales that have been down for the year are expected to turn positive in the fourth quarter due to new merchandise and “improving studio attendance trends,” according to the CFO.

More importantly it was reported that Oprah will be doing huge tour for Weight Watchers next year where she will tour the country to discuss her health journey and dialogue with experts on how to live healthier lifestyles. Oprah hasn’t been on a tour like this since 2014 and the surrounding fanfare is expected to bring an influx of new subscribers. Trailing PE 15.23.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Insider (Zovio and Assured Guarantee Ltd)**

There was insider buying at **Zovio** (online education) on Tuesday, by Chief Executive Officer Andrew S. Clark who purchased 150,000 shares for a cost of $2.58 each, for a total investment of $386,505. Zovio has fallen back to $2.30 since then but is up 44% since reporting Q3 results on October 31. 

On that call the education technology services company (and owner of online Ashford University) outlined a restructuring plan to drive cost savings totalling $51 million in 2020 and drive the company back to profitability with guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.50 to$0.90. If successfull the current stock price of $2.29 would be a bargain. The CEO’s purchase is an encouraging endorsement.

&amp;#x200B;

Insider buying at **Assured Guarantee Ltd** as Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Feldstein, makes a $1.17 million purchase on Wednesday.  It is actually his 13th purchase in the last six weeks.

The company is a monoline guarantor that insures municipal and structured debt issuance. It ran into trouble during the great recession but has staged something of a recovery and Mr Feldstein seems to be highly confident in its future.

Two points of interest that caught my eye;

1. The company estimates it’s non GAAP adjusted book value at $90.18 compared to Thursdays close at $48.60 (GAAP valuation of $68.94 also compares well) 

2. The company CEO said on the Q2 earnings call that he believed the firm had $3.2 billion of excess capital beyond what was required to maintain its AAA rating. A meaningful amount for a company with a market capitalization of $4.8 billion.

Southwest Airlines Co. and American Airlines Group Inc. said they will remove the 737 Max from their flight schedules through early March -- almost a year since Boeing Co.’s best-selling jet was grounded worldwide after two deadly crashes.

The plan to pull the plane from Southwest’s schedule through March 6 is due to “continued uncertainty around the timing of Max return to service,” the carrier said in a regulatory filing Friday. American followed suit within hours, saying it expected to resume commercial flights with the aircraft on March 5.
