Rembember this is not a blind picks to buy it at the open. It needs to form proper intraday setup. I like confirmation on my bias, meaning if the stock is in the LONG watchlist - it needs to hold opening range for me to get interested and if it is in SHORT watchlist - it needs to be below opening range.

As a beginner, it can be even more intimidating. I kept seeing everyone around me seemingly making moves with their investments but I had no idea to approach it. Then I decided to start reading more for myself. These three books were everything I needed as beginner:

\- Stock Investing for Dummies: Helped me understand how much I could afford to invest and what the key terms and definitions were. The best thing about this book is that you can jump around from chapter to chapter since each specific topic is fairly self-contained with that chapter. Also, the appendix can point you in the right direction with resources to learn more different brokers and investing books and websites to learn more.

\- Unshakeable by Tony Robbins: An excellent guide on the mindset that you need to have as an investor. It provides several facts that can free you from the fear and anxiety that dominates most people’s financial lives. I really think that this was the book that gave me the confidence I needed to get started with investing because of the amount of factual information about the market that was given.

\- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham: There are 2 chapters in here that will teach you more about being a successful investor than anything else. One on market fluctuations and one on incorporating what he calls a “Margin of safety”, which could help prevent you from losing a lot of money on your investments. Part of the focus of this book is to show you the importance in doing your own research before making any investments.

I highly recommend these and break these down in detail here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4wmcHElQY&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4wmcHElQY&amp;)

During times of high volatility, it can be tempting to get out of the market, but Bank of America said this can cost investors a lot over the long term.

Looking at data going back to 1930, the firm found that if an investor sat out the S&amp;P 500′s 10 best days per decade, total returns would be significantly lower than the return for investors who waited it out.

It was a day when the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, already at unprecedented lows, at one point dropped more than 25 basis points to below 0.7%. The S&amp;P 500 plunged as much as 4% before a closing rally cut that by half. Credit markets buckled after data showed cash fleeing corporate bond funds at the fastest ever pace.

From America to Europe, inflation expectations have plunged to the lowest this century. The options market shows bets for stock volatility still rising even after they hit the highest since the 2011 euro debt crisis. Cracks are appearing in both credit and the interbank lending markets.

“The antidote to this crisis, in my opinion as a citizen not as an expert, is to deal with the spread of the virus itself, not money printing or interest-rate cuts,” said Stephen Jen, chief executive officer at Eurizon SLJ. “With the passing of each day, the virus is spreading exponentially and the policy makers all have this blank stare.”",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,332581,public,confidence,self,Wild Week Puts Wall Street on Notice: The Rout Isn’t Going Away,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/few1no/wild_week_puts_wall_street_on_notice_the_rout/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# **Wall Street braces for more market volatility as wild swings become the ‘new normal’ amid coronavirus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/investors-brace-for-more-volatility-as-wild-swings-become-new-normal.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has never behaved like this, but Wall Street strategists say get used to it.
*****
&gt; Investors just witnessed the equity benchmark swinging up or down 2% for four days straight in the face of the coronavirus panic.
*****
&gt; In the index’s history dating back to 1927, this is the first time the S&amp;P 500 had a week of alternating gains and losses of more than 2% from Monday through Thursday, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.
*****
&gt; “The message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions. The coronavirus outbreak kept investors on edge as global cases of the infections surpassed 100,000. It’s also spreading rapidly in the U.S. California has declared a state of emergency, while the number of cases in New York reached 33.
*****
&gt; “Uncertainty breeds greater market volatility,” Keith Lerner, SunTrust’s chief market strategist, said in a note. “Much is still unknown about how severe and widespread the coronavirus will become. From a market perspective, what we are seeing is uncomfortable but somewhat typical after shock periods.”
*****
&gt; More stimulus?
&gt; So far, the actions from global central banks and governments in response to the outbreak haven’t triggered a sustainable rebound.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis did little to calm investor anxiety. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.
*****
&gt; “The market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,” said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. “If the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.”
*****
&gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn’t expect the moves to create a huge rebound.
*****
&gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting.
*****
&gt; Where is the bottom?
&gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds.
*****
&gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank’s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak.
*****
&gt; “The magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,” Chadha said in a note. “We do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.”
*****
&gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020.
*****
&gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling.
*****
&gt; “It is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,” Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.

# A ""Run of the Mill"" Drawdown

&gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.

&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!

# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire

&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**

&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**

&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**

&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?

# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil

&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**

&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**

&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.

# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%

&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. “The decline in yields has been remarkable,” said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today’s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.”

&gt; As shown in LPL Research’s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?

&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt
&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase
&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates

&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?

&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off
&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income
&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors
&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off

&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it’s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.

# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On

&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.

&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it’s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)

&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “February’s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That’s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.”

&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the–year economic rebound.

# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time

&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.

# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut

&gt; Today’s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these “emergency” or “surprise” rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.

&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only “worked” once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.

&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.

Using Robinhood gold, a user deposits $2000. Using margin, that user now has $3000 total to invest, $1000 being taxed at 5% interest per month.

I'll preface this by saying I'm not super confident in my trading abilities, but I think this is solid.  Hoping for some feedback here. Now, let the mudslinging begin.  

HDFC has the largest share price of the indian banks (floating at around $51.50 today) = the largest put potential.  It is the largest private sector lender, and largest bank by market cap in India. Total assets of $170B, market cap of $280B, revenue of $17B.  Besides having regular beervirus worries, this is a bank that was already in trouble.

They’ve been trying to find a successor for the replacement of the CEO Aditya Puri.  This guy has been at the helm since 1994, and has led the massive growth of the company since that time.  His awards have been racking up since 2013. Why does he want to get out now? Good question. His obvious successor resigned in the summer of 2018, and word has it that he isn’t interested in the position.  Not good. After a six month search, they announced on Wednesday this week that they can’t find anyone to take the role and they’re starting the search over. Why doesn’t anyone want this job? Does no one want to oversee the company’s downfall?  


India’s economy was slowing pre-beer virus: India's GDP growth for the October-December (Q3) quarter has slipped to 4.7 per cent as the government revised growth estimate for the second quarter to 5.1 per cent. It was earlier pegged at 4.5 per cent. https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/india-s-q3-gdp-growth-improves-marginally-at-4-7-1650933-2020-02-28


In repo market posts, people keepmentioneung crap collateral for loans at overseas banks.  Check out the list of items that HDFC specializes in providing loans for: auto loans, two wheeler loans, personal loans, loans against property, consumer durable loan, lifestyle loan and credit cards.  WTF is a lifestyle loan?  How do you take lifestyle as collateral? In addition to these crap sounding loans, they’ve just announced a partnership with Suzuki to provide auto loans.  Have you ever driven a Suzuki? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank  


Yes Bank, also an Indian Bank (but smaller), essentially went bankrupt yesterday and the Indian Central Bank stepped in to take it over.  Guess what types of loans they provide? Credit Card, Car Loan, Home Loan, Personal Loan, Bike Loan, Gold Loan, Loan Against Property, Credit Card Bill Payment, Construction Equipment Loan, Commercial Vehicle Loan… didn’t see any two wheeler loans listed.


PM Modi has been stating over and over again that the economic fundamentals are strong, and that the government will stand behind the financial institutions, but doing that for Yes Bank is a little easier that for a bank the size of HDFC.  Also, let’s not forget about the Beer Virus spreading in India.


Lucky for India, the country is known for being clean and well sanitized, so the spread of this virus will be easily contained. Cough cough MF’ers.  So far India has been spared, and so it hasn’t really effected the economy… yet. That changed this week. The number of cases jumped sharply from 6 to 31 yesterday.  Based on those official numbers, we can assume that hundreds of others are well on their way to testing, even with the closures of schools until the end of March, and much subdued Holi celebrations.  The politicians are staying away from the celebrations, but you can bet people will still fill the streets. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-india-200305091138840.html


Finally, my prediction: Covid in India spreads faster than Aunti’s Pork Vindaloo recipe, and the government responds by continuing to shut down schools and places of business.  This in turn hurts the individual worker’s abilities to pay off their short term, high interest, shit-asset backed loans, and the bank gets in trouble real quick. Combine this with the lack of black box liquidity in the repo market AND the fact that the Indian government won’t be able to bail out all of the banks, and you have India’s Lehman Brothers. Now take all of that and weight it against a historically stable stock price, and you have low entry puts that could yield some massive results.

When asked if stocks — again well off their mid-February highs — represented a buying opportunity of a lifetime right now, only 36% said Yes.

It’s been a wild ride in the markets the past two weeks, and I think that this is just the beginning of what we’ll be seeing.

I’ve been reading up on posts on this subreddit as well as r/stocks, giving advice on what to expect looking forward, as well as hearing what you guys have to say about this situation.

Let’s face it - China and Germany, two powerful leaders in the economy, are already in a recession right now, causing a HUGE sting in the Global Supply Chain. We’ve been seeing new articles pop up everyday discussing new problems that our economy is challenged with.

I’m not an advocate for selling fear, but I really do think we should prepare ourselves. 

Not in the sense of hoarding up toilet paper, but in the sense of taking a look at our current positions and possibly locking in profits and dollar cost averaging as markets continue to tumble.

I posted a video about this situation on my channel but don’t want it to be the focus of this post. **I intend this post to be a discussion of what’s been going on the past two weeks and what you think will happen in the coming months.** If you care to watch it, here’s a link: https://youtu.be/oAO4kiBmAwk

It needs to confirm the thesis and my bias.

Market gapped down substantially - so there might be some nice bounce setups.

Also DRAD ENZ NNVC STIM TGNA gapped up 30%+ or more and should be on watch for the opportunities as well.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1L9K7sAPW4) video provides some evidence and explanations, but it isn't enough to confirm a release date or the actual name of the game.

For Red Dead Redemption 2, TTWO's latest game, the trailer was released in October 2016, and the actual game in October 2018. From 2016 to 2018 the stock price steadily grew from 34 USD to 110 USD in that period. But after the release the price didn't change much, it fell and rose, now it's at 115 USD.

So what I'm asking is: ""Will a trailer for GTA 6 or the release of GTA 6 boost the stock?"" and ""Is it smart to invest now in TTWO?""

Technically, a trailer should get people hyped for the release, and make investors start buying, thus the price skyrocketing, but that wasn't the case with RDR2, the price steadily grew as it got closer to the release date, then when it released the price rose a bit and fell.

So what's your opinion on this ? Is the trailer hype logic even true ?

The stocks I\'ve listed in the edit at the bottom of this thread are what I\'ve collected from the comments and have *not* been vetted by me. I\'m floating the idea of opening a google doc for public collaboration on research into these banks. I don\'t vouch for any of the tickers I\'ve mentioned in this thread. Yet.\n\nDrop me a chat (not a dm, swear to god, reddit doesn\'t need two different messaging systems) if you\'d like to talk about coordinating. I\'ll get up with you guys tomorrow. I would love to pool information and repost this over the weekend with a more comprehensive picture of what the fuck is going on with the international lending system. Cheers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nForgot to put strike/date at the top: I\'m in September BAC $18 puts. Banks will start failing later this year. It\'s hard to tell which ones will fail, due to the *shadowy* nature of the *shadow lending* market. That, and the dollar will moon. You want positions spoonfed to you? Fuck off. This post is half food for thought, half explanation. Trying to follow the money here is *hard.* If you\'re lazy, just buy puts on indices like $INDA and $EWG and $EWY: any country that\'s loaded up on eurodollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, you tards, listen up: this is going to be a long, confusing post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off, I\'d like to say that I\'m not smart. But that doesn\'t concern me, because you\'re not smart, either. I just began reading about repo operations a few days ago. I\'ve seen a few posts on here lately remarking on the repo ops, and a lot of misconceptions about what they *are* and what they\'re intended to *do*. I\'ve learned all of what I\'m going to post here from other users on here and from my own research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most important thing you need to understand about the repo market is that it\'s a black box. It\'s an **interbank loan market** **where securities (ideally bonds) are put up as collateral for short-term cash loans**. The transactions are private and the market usually sets the rates. Repurchase agreements are semantically different from fed repos, but **operate in the exact same way.** This is important. Banks, per federal legislation, are required to keep a minimum amount of cash on hand to prevent liquidity issues. The repo market exists as a way to circumvent these requirements; banks run as close to the reserve requirements as possible to maximize their profitability, and sometimes run below the limit. In this case, the bank posts collateral on the repo market in exchange for liquid cash to meet the requirements again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn September of last year, the fed was forced to offer hundreds of billions of dollars in repo agreements to banks. This is because the interbank repo interest rate had reached 10% due to liquidity problems. I\'m still not sure, and I\'m not sure that anyone else is sure, why the liquidity shortage arose, but it did. If I were to hazard a guess, it\'s because big domestic lenders, sensing volatility abroad, started to pull out of the repo market. Since then, the fed has been, on-and-off, offering repo agreements to large banks (designated banks are called Primary Dealer Banks \\[PDBs\\]) and they hold a special status and maintain accounts with the fed. Once these PDBs post collateral (again, securities), money (kind of) is transferred temporarily to their fed account. These PDBs then distribute the cash in the interbank repo market (which is anonymous) at a slight profit. The fed repo interest rate was around 1.6%; on Tuesday night, it jumped up to 1.8% because of the emergency demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fed had planned to cut repo ops to 0 by April of this year, essentially weaning the US banking system off of liquidity infusions. This didn\'t happen. Due to supply chain disruptions and market volatility, the fed was forced to offer several hundred billion in overnight repo agreements this week to PDBs in an effort to maintain liquidity. In fact, this month is set to hit record repo lending balances. Furthermore, the [fed is expecting another $130b](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details#monthly-summary) to be repaid in the next three weeks, sucking even more liquidity out of the market.\n\nEdit: The fed was also pondering establishing a standing clearing house for fed repos to smaller entities like hedge funds. Hopefully, they\'re walking that idea back, because it\'s a fucking *terrible* one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here\'s where I learned I was wrong, and this is a point of confusion for some: **the banks don\'t need the liquidity for themselves.** They need the liquidity for their *borrowers*. See, these PDBs float money anonymously in the repo market to lots and lots of entities, both domestic and foreign. This is *shadow banking*. Remember when I said the repo market is a black box? Right, well, American banks have been lending money to foreign banks that don\'t have as stringent of regulations as American ones do. In the US, between two US banks, when a loan is written, some percentage of the loan size must be physically transferred over to the borrower (the reserve amount). Between an American bank and a foreign bank, though, no such requirement exists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom this discrepancy in regulation, the eurodollar is born. **The eurodollar is imaginary money** that is printed by American banks: when they make a loan to a foreign bank, the loan exists only on the balance sheets. There is no physical manifestation of currency transfer. Consequently, eurodollars get *leveraged to shit*. Instead of the fractional reserve system, the ideal interbank loan system in America, eurodollars can get loaned indefinitely, forever. Eurodollars are paying factory workers, building bridges, and trading as currency. But it\'s *not* currency. And because eurodollars are what circulate outside the US, real USD are becoming increasingly rare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, the USD has become the de facto global currency. There\'s a lot of confidence in it. It backs virtually every exchange of goods or services in the world. Right now, though, emerging markets\' banks aren\'t really using it; they\'re hoarding it. Additionally, they\'re accepting *awful* collateral in exchange for eurodollars, because they know the USD has intrinsic value and eurodollars are imaginary. Collateral like subprime loans. Sound familiar? It should, because the 08 crisis was global *because of the international monetary system*. The mortgage defaults here at home were just the impetus - just like the supply chain disruptions this year might be. The subprime mortgage scandal was just the scapegoat for the **underlying fragility of the eurodollar system.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, PDBs are aware of this. That\'s one reason they\'re starting to become stingier with their lending. They know that their borrowers are accepting garbage collateral in exchange for eurodollars. They know that foreign banks are leveraging themselves up to the tits on *low-grade collateral,* which means, in essence, the fed is, by proxy, making out hundreds of billions in loans to banks in places like India for fucking used car loans instead of treasury bonds. So, say that Shyam over in India can\'t make his car payments this month because he hasn\'t worked since the quarantine began. And his neighbors all do the same. Without US liquidity injections, channeled through the PDBs and into the shady repo market, that Indian bank will fail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, that\'s why it matters that US lenders are pulling out of foreign markets: with supply/manufacturing disruptions and increasing volatility all over the world, foreign banks are direly hurting for liquidity so they can make out loans for businesses and manufacturers and individuals and all sorts of entities. If they don\'t get this liquidity, they\'re likely to default. And what happens when these capital groups and small banks die? They default on *their* loans. So on, up the chain. Say JPM takes out $50b against its treasuries from the fed. It then sells that money on the repo market. Eventually, that money finds its way to Yong Jiang over in China, who took out a loan to keep the lights on in the McDonald\'s Toy factory in Hubei. Well, three months later, sales haven\'t made up for lost revenue during the quarantine, and Yong Jiang becomes insolvent and defaults on his loan. That default makes its way back up the ladder to JPM. Now, JPM can either default on its loan from the fed (and bonds get dumped on the market) or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJPM has made this calculation and decided, fuck no, it wants none of that. The problem is, though, that the loan has already been taken out by Yong Jiang. Say Yong Jiang\'s bank needs some liquidity because Yong defaults. Well, JPM has stopped taking fed repos because of the risk, so there\'s no money to buy on the market, and Yong\'s bank fails. This happens dozens of times, across dozens of countries. Pretty soon, the international banking industry faces systemic collapse. For reference, the global repo market [is valued at $12T](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjqgof02IToAhXwm-AKHY3rA8gQFjACegQICxAF&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bis.org%2Fpubl%2Fcgfs59.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw21Jay8zD6uNqWJcspNvCXa) USD, and only 3/4 of it is backed by ""pristine collateral"" - government bonds. **That means that $3T of it is in equities or derivatives.** The fed\'s balance sheet is only *$4T* USD in comparison. Additionally, $.5T is in private capital groups, which are entirely opaque and likely have rotten fucking lending standards. No way to see who they\'re lending to, or what collateral they\'re taking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe\'re already seeing this beginning: [India\'s Yes Bank is about to be nationalized](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/india-s-central-bank-to-seize-yes-bank-to-help-revive-lender) due to, you guessed it, *liquidity* problems. It\'s been involved in shadow lending practices, and American liquidity is starting to dry up across the world. China is also heavily dependent on eurodollars, but I\'m not sure how that relationship will shake out. Their economy might be so big and so vital that we\'re forced to prop them up. If not, China\'s banking system will go tits up, too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe question then becomes, is the fed willing and able to meet global liquidity demands? And beyond this, how do they force PDBs to keep printing eurodollars and continue to assume risk, risk which may violate their fiduciary obligation to shareholders? Trillion-dollar question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what does all this mean? Who can we short? Honestly, this is hard to say. Personally, I have september puts on BAC for $18, and I\'m still looking for anyone else who might be vulnerable. Any of the PDBs with accounts at the fed might be at risk. I\'m going to start hunting for SE Asian, African, and South American banks that\'ve been taking repo money. Those are likely to be the most probable to fail. On top of that, as banks start dropping like flies and the global economy tanks, the USD is going to fucking \\*moon\\*. That\'s a worthwhile bet, too. The issue here is that the repo market is anonymous, so it\'s hard to follow the money. If anyone has any recommendations for specific banks or lending groups to target or look into more, please feel free to let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the global banking industry started to fail, though, look for it to hit full swing later this year. This is going to be driven by large amounts of defaults that will be spurred by the manufacturing disruptions, the extent of which won\'t be fully felt until at least midway through this year. Add a few months for missed loan payments, and I\'m wagering that you\'ll see banks start *really* failing by August or September.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere\'s a lot here I\'m going to continue to research, and if there\'s anything I\'ve gotten wrong or anything you\'d like to add, please speak up and correct me/educate me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\nu/Psicopro, u/farisbuellerRULES, u/FlexMcgooch, u/meritorius_demotion, and every other fucking angel who answered my stupid goddamn questions and let me bounce ideas off of them\n\nThis is a good sub, guys; embrace cooperation and weaponize your collective autism\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: For further reading, check out Jeff Snider. He\'s a macro economist who\'s been shrieking about this for years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: thanks for the positive responses and the awards, guys! Please, let me know if you find anything related to these repo market participants, either in the comments or (preferably) in a DM. I\'ll either update this post or write an updated DD. Cheers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: list of vulnerable recommended banks from the comments - Bank of East Asia, HDB, IBN (both in India) - keep em coming, guys\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 4: this blew up even more than I expected. I\'m likely going to repost this over the weekend with more information and more citations, and I\'m considering the possibility of opening up a google doc to aggregate research into vulnerable banks. Hit me up in my chat if you\'ve got relevant information on this, or if you\'d like to talk about the possibility of collaborating. I\'m not sure how risky it would be to pool research like this, but I\'m fascinated by the idea of crowdsourcing the work to identify the weak points in the international banking system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before people start throwing money at stocks they haven&amp;#39;t researched: I am not (yet) prescribing any positions. The stocks I&amp;#39;ve listed in the edit at the bottom of this thread are what I&amp;#39;ve collected from the comments and have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; been vetted by me. I&amp;#39;m floating the idea of opening a google doc for public collaboration on research into these banks. I don&amp;#39;t vouch for any of the tickers I&amp;#39;ve mentioned in this thread. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drop me a chat (not a dm, swear to god, reddit doesn&amp;#39;t need two different messaging systems) if you&amp;#39;d like to talk about coordinating. I&amp;#39;ll get up with you guys tomorrow. I would love to pool information and repost this over the weekend with a more comprehensive picture of what the fuck is going on with the international lending system. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forgot to put strike/date at the top: I&amp;#39;m in September BAC $18 puts. Banks will start failing later this year. It&amp;#39;s hard to tell which ones will fail, due to the &lt;em&gt;shadowy&lt;/em&gt; nature of the &lt;em&gt;shadow lending&lt;/em&gt; market. That, and the dollar will moon. You want positions spoonfed to you? Fuck off. This post is half food for thought, half explanation. Trying to follow the money here is &lt;em&gt;hard.&lt;/em&gt; If you&amp;#39;re lazy, just buy puts on indices like $INDA and $EWG and $EWY: any country that&amp;#39;s loaded up on eurodollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, you tards, listen up: this is going to be a long, confusing post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, I&amp;#39;d like to say that I&amp;#39;m not smart. But that doesn&amp;#39;t concern me, because you&amp;#39;re not smart, either. I just began reading about repo operations a few days ago. I&amp;#39;ve seen a few posts on here lately remarking on the repo ops, and a lot of misconceptions about what they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; and what they&amp;#39;re intended to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve learned all of what I&amp;#39;m going to post here from other users on here and from my own research.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important thing you need to understand about the repo market is that it&amp;#39;s a black box. It&amp;#39;s an &lt;strong&gt;interbank loan market&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;where securities (ideally bonds) are put up as collateral for short-term cash loans&lt;/strong&gt;. The transactions are private and the market usually sets the rates. Repurchase agreements are semantically different from fed repos, but &lt;strong&gt;operate in the exact same way.&lt;/strong&gt; This is important. Banks, per federal legislation, are required to keep a minimum amount of cash on hand to prevent liquidity issues.

Dow Jones has been losing a lot of points recently because of coronavirus fears. I heard that when stocks go down it's the *best* time to buy because it can only go up (or down!).

I know it's impossible to predict its ongoing route, but I like to hear others' opinions on these things to get somewhat of an idea.

Through mismanagement, and bad design it has lost that high level of appeal and for most of 2019 was stable around $2.90-3.50.

2. What happens if groupon is acquired? I actually am not that educated on this so I was curious do stocks still get paid out on a premium, or do they convert it to the acquiring companies stock at a discounted rate?

Reason one, it will make social security solvent. Reason two, there will be an excess supply of houses millennials will be able to buy for pennies on the dollar.  ",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,330720,public,confidence,self,Man who predicted the Black Death of 1347 speaks out on Coronavirus,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fdtqrh/man_who_predicted_the_black_death_of_1347_speaks/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Wall Street –** Markets cheered this morning after the Federal Reserve cured the coronavirus by cutting interest rates by 50 basis points.  “It is exciting how much medical power the Federal Reserve has just by cutting interest rates,” a doctor at Cambridge Medical Center of Incurable Diseases stated.  “With just a click of a button the Federal Reserve did the impossible and found the cure to the coronavirus.  Who knew the cure to the coronavirus was cheap money?”  Communities around the globe applauded as helicopter money was literally dumped from the skies.  Many people later took to the social media app *Tik Tok* and shot up United States Dollars into their veins.  “I instantly felt better after shooting up cheap money into my veins,” a social media influencer with the coronavirus said.  President Trump later made the statement that the Federal Reserve needs to cut rates further so we can solve other incurable diseases like cancer and aids.  Despite the rate cut, travel stonks continued to fall deeper into the red.  Apparently, no matter how cheap money is, consumers still don’t want to be caught dead on a cruise ship.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,329056,public,confidence,self,Markets cheer as the Federal Reserve cures coronavirus with cheap money,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fd37be/markets_cheer_as_the_federal_reserve_cures/,all_ads,6,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'uRr12wKdf6w1aHTxaVx8k4RTbhMrXo-Y-j1ewLdz7xE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Wlyy126vBtTnJlA2aLL3657vre4Rzw-Jm5OYGDyiRO4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6fc06b9f6f8aa748ab3f09cd104cd1dca6cbcff', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Wlyy126vBtTnJlA2aLL3657vre4Rzw-Jm5OYGDyiRO4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16608e89c2ac9663858ad6747bbc13b4f2dc8c7f', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Wlyy126vBtTnJlA2aLL3657vre4Rzw-Jm5OYGDyiRO4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe9894075339ea5e0d2ffdea9e6a63d06f0ee57', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 384, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Wlyy126vBtTnJlA2aLL3657vre4Rzw-Jm5OYGDyiRO4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b94dff925e3f62b7d409ae72b2120c0b3cf76c21', 'width': 512}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

 Stock-market investors weren’t taking much comfort Tuesday from the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point in a rare, inter-meeting move aimed at cushioning the economy from disruptions from the global spread of COVID-19. 

 

“I think the Fed rates cuts backfired in many ways. Instead of soothing the market, it’s reignited investors’ worst fears,” Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.

Stocks initially jumped after the announcement, but [**gains proved short-lived**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-futures-wobble-lower-as-wall-street-watches-for-global-policy-response-to-coronavirus-2020-03-03). The Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-2.94%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote)  fell nearly 1,000 points at its session low and remains down more than 650 points, or 2.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 [**SPX,** **-2.81%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote)  and Nasdaq Composite [**COMP,** **-2.99%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp?mod=MW_story_quote) remain down more than 2%. Stocks had bounced back sharply on Monday, taking back a chunk of the previous week’s steep losses that were tied to growing fears the spread of the coronavirus would deliver a global economic shock.

 Meanwhile, investors piled into haven assets, including Treasurys, driving the yield on the benchmark 10-year note [**TMUBMUSD10Y,** **-12.56%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx&amp;mod=MW_story_quote)  [**below 1% for the first time ever**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-year-treasury-yield-pushes-below-1-for-first-time-in-history-2020-03-03). Yields fall as debt prices rise. 

What gives? Here’s what analysts and investors are saying about the Fed decision and the market reaction so far:

# Things may be worse than they look

While an interest rate cut was good for a knee-jerk positive reaction in equity indexes, gains soon faded as the initial euphoria gave way to questions about just how worried policy makers must be to prompt such a rare move. It signals to investors “that policy makers are grasping significant uncertainty and rapidly mounting downside risks,” said Lara Rhame, chief U.S. economist at FS Investments, in an interview.

# Wrong medicine for a supply shock

There is also the longstanding question of how effective monetary stimulus, and even some forms of fiscal stimulus, can be in the face of what is likely to be a “supply shock” — the type of economic hit caused by the absence of goods and services as the virus forces factory shutdowns and curtails transportation and travel. Monetary and fiscal stimulus is typically aimed at mitigating demand shocks, which are sharp cutbacks in spending by households, businesses or governments.

They recently hitten their all-time low (down more than 90% this year), but a whole bunch of executives and directors just bought stock. 

Key Points:

\- SLRX is down almost 90% this year

\- A bunch of executives and directors just purchased common stock and/or a warrant with a right to buy at a price of $1.15 (current price is $0.98).

\- They recently raised a public offering at a price of $1.15 (this is why most, but not all, of the directors and executives above purchased

\- 2 executives didn't buy during the public offering but bought afterward when the stock was under $0.90

Today I half-listened to their free conference on what they think the new FAANG companies will be and as I expected, all they did was tease one of the companies in their new acronym ""FAZER"" (F- Fastly)... while the rest of them will stay behind a 1,299 paywall which will go up to 1,999 after midnight tonight. The service they are touting is called IPO Trailblazers.

&amp;#x200B;

The price is putting me off immensely but I admit their uber-marketing are having some sort of effect on me, and I'm becoming strangely tempted. Maybe such a service would pay back for itself in the long run, after all. That being said it's a *lot* of money.

NEW YORK /PRNewswire/ -- [Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2704530-1&amp;h=2283290156&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics), (NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced that its MEG Group subsidiary Qingdao Mobile New Energy Vehicle Sales Co. Ltd. has received an initial investment of ¥50 Million RMB (approx. $7.2M US) from Qingdao Xingyang City Investment Co., Ltd. as part of a series of investments valuing the subsidiary at ¥2 Billion RMB (approx. $288M US).

The follow-on investments will come as the newly formed MEG-owned sales group realizes sales targets of ¥10 Billion RMB per additional investment tranche of 50 Million RMB, with the full ¥200 Million RMB investment for a 10% stake in Qingdao Mobile New Energy Vehicle Sales Co. Ltd. achieved when gross sales reach ¥30 Billion RMB (approximately $4B US). Ideanomics had previously announced its plans to headquarter its MEG subsidiary in Qingdao, creating a commercial EV hub to showcase the depth of its manufacturing partner alliance to both governmental and enterprise fleet operators.

""The investment comes at an important time, with our MEG division ramping up operations. The investment from Qingdao's investment fund is a recognition of our impact on the commercial EV ecosystem in China,"" said Alf Poor, CEO of Ideanomics. ""We have already taken in the initial investment, and the sales targets for the full investment will require MEG to sell around one hundred thousand units in total EV sales across our 4 segments of Logistical Vehicles, Taxis, City and Tour Buses, and Heavy Trucks. As the logistical vehicle market in China alone is some 14 million vehicles, it provides us with the size and scale to achieve those sales' targets with a relatively minor share of the total commercial EV market. We're thrilled to be basing our sales group in Qingdao and having the city participate as a stakeholder in our sales organization"".

U.S. stocks skyrocketed on Monday, with the Dow setting a single-day point record in a broad-based rebound, after mounting coronavirus fears sent global markets into a week-long swoon.

The powerful rally sent the blue-chip Dow index soaring by more than 1,290 points, which beat the previous record set in December 2018 and snapped a brutal seven-session losing streak. On a percentage basis, the S&amp;P 500 Index and Nasdaq both saw their biggest move in over a year.

Honestly though, I am completely at a loss as to why the Fed would acquiesce to cutting rates right now. I understand that the market fell a whopping ~15% in a week (and gained back 5% today just from the promise of cuts), but using up more of an already depleted arsenal seems really unnecessary right now.

Coronavirus is not a money problem - its a people problem. If people are scared to go out and interact with others (eat out at restaurants, take public transit, go shopping etc. etc.) injecting money into the system won't solve that problem. People could be sitting on $1,000 or $1,000,000, but if they're afraid to go outside, all the money in the world won't matter. 

I also think its pretty ironic and sad that President Trump is so fixated on propping up the stock market that his speeches and tweets keep revolving around the Fed cutting rates and how the market is a great buying opportunity right now etc. etc. The one thing that would actually quell the fear in the market is strong leadership and decisive action with regards to CV, and right now, I don't think we've seen that.

Whenever it may be that the Fed cuts rates, my main concern is that big money uses that for a quick buck, and then continues to dump as CV spreads. They're aware of the exposure. They're aware that rate cuts won't solve the issue. I'm honestly shocked that the Fed acquiesced when they must know as well that rate cuts will not stop the bleeding just yet.

I hated 9-5 job from the beginning and I was not educated, didn’t finish college, because I thought that I am “too cool for school” – because of that I had to work different low paying jobs and nothing is worse than working 9-5 and it pays a little.

So I started to look for ways how to start making extra money. We need to go way back in history. We are talking about 2003

I was watching TV one day and saw how Chris Moneymaker won WSOP for a win of $2,5 million. His story was really inspiring – he didn’t pay $10,000 to get in the tournament, he won the main event entry from $40 poker satellite.

I thought to myself what are the odds that player wins from $40 $10,000 seat and then from $10,000 makes $2,5 million.

I knew that there should be some strategy and not simple luck factor.

So I researched online how to start playing poker – my first choice was Party Poker – I started playing for free chips and the first day I made from 10,000 play chips into 1,000000 chips

Wow I though if I could do that with real money that would be cool. So I deposited $500 and didn’t read any books – was just using common sense and I came up with the strategy – what is now called – Tight Aggressive.

The first month I made about 500$ next month $2000 then it grew and grew and eventually I became professional online poker player.

Everything was so cool – i could just play 2-3 hours per day anywhere in the world – so I was living abroad and playing online poker.

But nothing lasts forever and it was bound to happen. On April 15, 2011 Black Friday came. FBI basically shut down all online poker sites and almost all my money were frozen.

It became illegal to play poker from the US. It was devastating so I had to find how can I afford my current lifestyle. And I started dabbling into the stocks. ( A bit before when Black Friday came)

I thought that since I could crack the system of poker I will be able to crack the system of wall street.

Oh boy, I was wrong – for 3 straight years I was loosing day trading stocks. I would reach bunch of books, try to come up with the “common sense strategies” but nothing was working.

When you think about it – we are paying spread and commission to the broker – so that means that even if we predict direction of the stock at 55-57% of the time if our risk to reward is 1-1 – we will not be making money.

So after 3-4 years of struggling I decided that something needs to change. I decided to find successful trader online and just ask for help.

After doing some searching I asked traders to coach me. A lot of them refused saying that they do not have time and offered me to join their trading chat rooms so I could copy their trades.

I did what they told me to do – but for some reason I wasn’t be able to make money with chat rooms. To this day I was in 12 trading chat rooms and only 3 of them were good, where there is a lot of extra value provided to learn the trading strategies.

Eventually I found a successful trader who took me under his wing and showed me great trading strategies. In 3 months I became consistently profitable trader and now 90% of the trading days I make profit for a long time.

So what is the lesson here? If you are trying to learn everything by yourself it will not going to work or you will spend 10x more time than working with the mentor.

If you really think that you have what it takes to be great day trader let me know. What I am looking for in the students is someone who can study a lot, discipline, mind focused on strategy, system, techniques and optimization.

Hate to kill your buzz, but if you want fast &amp; easy money in day trading it will not happen. Day trading is like a performance sport – only the best survive. You need to be better trader than average and for that you need an edge.

Edge in trading setups that you trade, edge in real time scanning, edge in risk management, edge in broker which gives you the best fills, 10 ms later broker and you could get 0.04-0.05 slippage – that is 50$ out of pocket if you trade 1000 shares.

To summarize – don’t be cheap on your education, learn from better traders as fast as possible – that will pay out long term dividends.

I have doubled my stock trading account the last two years and wanted to document my trades and journey for year three, starting with 21.3k this week, I want to see what I can turn that into this year. If you want to read that post in more detail you can do so here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f8ijb3/documenting\_stock\_trading\_journey\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f8ijb3/documenting_stock_trading_journey_2020/) 

So this past week for those following was absolutely wild. The market saw some of its biggest drops in history! SPY saw some massive daily drops throughout the week and the market was very bloody just about everyday. However, I ended the week up $465! I will say I took a couple losses that were bigger than I anticipated due to the massive market drops but very happy I came out of this week in the positive.

I haven't really decided how I want to document this, whether I want to post weekly or monthly updates. I guess I will figure that out as I go. But I did want to at least provide a week 1 update after my original post.

Going into this past week I was only holding CORV at $0.30. This stock had done a decent job at holding that level and it went on a huge run this week. This stock ran up over $0.60 and saw over 100% increase from my entry level. Unfortunately I did not capture gains very well on this trade. The market performing so poorly really made me gun shy to hold out on some of these trades I normally would. I sold this one at $0.32 for 5% gains and $225 proft.

On Monday this week I bought KMPH, VEON and BIOC. KMPH and VEON had seen big drops back to prior support levels. Unfortunately, with those stocks having steep drops recently combined with the market having massive drops both those stocks continued their free fall and blew through support levels so I had to cut both KMPH and VEON. KMPH I took a pretty sizeable 15% loss - $750 and VEON I took a 6% loss - $300.

At this point I was down about $800 on the week which obviously wasn't ideal but I was fairly happy with not losing a unreasonable amount due to the market turmoil that was going to make it hard for me to recoup. $800 was a fairly easy amount for me to get back. Also I have traded BIOC 3-4 times in the past and I have always had a great feel for this stock and felt confident in its next move. It also hadn't really dropped much with the market. I got the pop I was looking for in BIOC on Friday and sold it at $0.40 for 29% gains - $1250 profit. Although BIOC similar to CORV ran for over 100% gains.

I will say I am kind of disappointed in myself for cutting CORV and BIOC so early. I really could have capitalized on those and profited over $5,000. I let the overall market sentiment affect my judgement and strategy on getting the most I could out of the winners. On both of those winners if I had set stop losses 2% below where I sold them and then incrementally moved up my stop loss as the stock continued to rise I could have maximized my gains much better, I also could have used a trailing stop on these and that would have played out well also.

Anyway, overall I am very happy with being in the green this week after seeing how the rest of the market experienced one of its worst weeks of all time. I post my trades and charts and discuss things a little more in depth on my twitter account if you want to check it out, give me a follow or validate the information above:  [https://twitter.com/TheBreadMakerr](https://twitter.com/TheBreadMakerr)  Hope you enjoyed the breakdowns.

I don't know a ton about finance, and I have a question I'm hoping you can answer.

I've heard some people say that you should always keep your money in the market because even if the market goes down, it always bounces back eventually.

But nobody has their money in ""the stock market"" as a whole. They have their money in businesses that are part of the stock market. And it seems to me that, if there's a big enough disaster that takes lots of huge businesses out of business, investors are screwed, even those with diverse portfolios. The market itself might rebound --- with totally new businesses --- but the businesses you're invested in might never recover. So an individual investor is still ruined.

For instance, during the Great Depression, the stock market crashed, and lots of businesses went under. The market eventually rebounded, but I imagine a huge number of businesses people were invested in never did, right? New businesses just sprang up to take their place. So people who were invested in the 20s never got their money back. 

Anyways, would love your thoughts. Thanks!",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,325544,public,confidence,self,Question for people who say the stock market always recovers,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fbk8lp/question_for_people_who_say_the_stock_market/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**
*****
&gt; Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&amp;P 500′s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.
*****
&gt; Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.
*****
&gt; The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.
*****
&gt; “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”
*****
&gt; Weekend action?
&gt; The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.
*****
&gt; Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.
*****
&gt; The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.
*****
&gt; Cutting forecasts
&gt; Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.
*****
&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.
*****
&gt; Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&amp;P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.
*****
&gt; To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.
*****
&gt; “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.
*****
&gt; Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.

# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19

&gt; The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&amp;P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.

&gt; “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”

&gt; Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.

&gt; **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.

# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?

&gt; It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.

&gt; Of the 97 S&amp;P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&amp;P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times.

# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&amp;P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off

&gt; Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**

&gt; Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&amp;P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**

&gt; While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.

# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)

&gt; It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**

&gt; Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**

&gt; The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**

&gt; Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**

&gt; Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**

&gt; This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.

# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs

&gt; The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.

&gt; At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&amp;P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

# Just Four S&amp;P 500 Stocks Up This Week

&gt; There's still another day left in the week, but unless things improve on Friday this will go down as one of the worst weeks for US equities in history. Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&amp;P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&amp;P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**

&gt; On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.

&gt; One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?

The Coronavirus outbreak has reached the “[highest level](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51680560)” of risk for the world, the World Health Organization announced today. Bill Gates [calls coronavirus a 'once-in-a-century' pathogen.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/bill-gates-calls-coronavirus-a--once-in-a-century--pathogen-12483428) The Dow fell over [3,500 points this week](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/us-stocks-feb-28-2020). 

The US Federal Reserve's Chairman stated [""U.S. economy remain strong""](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20200228a.htm), Iran has [no plans to quarantine cities](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51651454), The acting US administration is [lying to the public](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/factchecking-trumps-coronavirus-press-conference/), and has [barred the top US disease expert from speaking freely to the public.](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/the-trump-administration-has-barred-the-top-us-disease-expert-from-speaking-freely-to-the-public-after-he-warned-the-coronavirus-may-be-impossible-to-contain/ar-BB10w9Q7) 

-

* 84,154 confirmed cases worldwide *(7 day Increase:🔺5,958 or 7.61%)*
* 2,876 fatalities

-

**[Countries with First Case Outbreaks between 2/26 - 2/28](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)**

1. Mexico
2. Azerbaijan
3. Belarus
4. Lithuania
5. Nigeria
6. San Marino
7. Netherlands
8. Estonia
9. Denmark
10. Romania
11. Norway
12. Georgia
13. North Macedonia
14. Greece
15. Brazil
16. Iceland
17. Monaco

*[Keep in mind the asymptomatic period was reported to be at most 27 days](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/) and [patients whom recovered are developing the coronavirus and testing positive again](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-reinfection-explainer/explainer-coronavirus-reappears-in-discharged-patients-raising-questions-in-containment-fight-idUSKCN20M124), which means public exposure in these countries could have begun weeks ago. By Monday, I estimate that there will be at least 2,000 total new cases in the above countries experiencing the new outbreaks alone.*


*Why does this matter? This weekend the Corona Virus news will be flowing steadily, thus IMO influencing the virus stocks to continue to rise on Monday and throughout next week.*

-

**Controlling the outbreak is going to become increasingly difficult.**


[To control the majority of viral outbreaks, for R0 of 2-5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1·5. For R0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30074-7/fulltext) 

[Researchers estimate the R0 value of COVID-19 to be likely between 4.7 and 6.6. Further, they speculate that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)


-

**The Case of Africa**

With the continent's [high volume of air traffic and trade between China](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0771-1) new outbreaks are inevitable.

Without treatment or vaccines, and without pre-existing immunity, sustained Corona Virus outbreaks might be devastating due to the multiple health challenges the continent already faces: rapid population growth and increased movement of people; existing endemic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria; remerging and emerging infectious pathogens such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa haemorrhagic fever, and others; and increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases.

[Governments are already anticipating demand and addressing supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30411-6/fulltext): large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents.

IMO, the market for the products of Corona Virus stocks will increase exponentially when new outbreaks begin in this continent. 

-

**The Stock Market**

Things are about to get way worse.

[The Harvard Business review predicts that the peak of the impact of Covid-19 on global supply chains will occur in mid-March, forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe. The activity of Chinese manufacturing plants has fallen in the past month and is expected to remain depressed for months.](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march)

Brace for a major effect on manufacturing worldwide. It will begin to hit full force in two to three weeks and could last for months. IMO, the only safe plays are plastic, Biotech, and Biopharmaceutical stocks. Liquidate your other positions now so you can buy back in lower. 

-

**The Vaccines Stocks**

According to the WHO, more than 20 coronavirus vaccines are in development around the world. IMO, I am waiting to invest in the below companies once they release more data on their Corona virus vaccines.

* Stock is just starting to see volume again. [All time high was $6.70] (https://imgur.com/I9EZSOf), [currently trading at $3.20](https://imgur.com/x03vuXZ). IMO, possibly the next APT / AHPI next week if we see volume. Start watching when it pushes above $3.29, load if it crosses $3.50. 90% return to $6.70 resistance.

**The USA**

More cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It’s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States. 

[Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html)

[Congress is working toward approving $6-8 billion to fight coronavirus. White House Director of Legislative Affairs stated the goal is to have Trump sign the funding package next week.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/congress-works-on-providing-6-billion-to-8-billion-to-fight-coronavirus-2020-02-28)

As of 2/28. there are now 61 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States, according to an update today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These include:

* 43 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship

* 3 people repatriated from China

* 15 US cases

[The 15 US cases include nine in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California. The latest case in California did not have any relevant travel history or known contact with another infected person, suggesting it could be the first instance of ""community spread"" of the virus in the United States, according to health officials.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/us-cases-coronavirus-community-transmission/index.html)

[The CDC aims to have *ALL* state and local health departments testing for coronavirus by end of next week.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/health/coronavirus-us-updates-california-patient/index.html) Word choice of all is interesting here, we already know that the CDC didn't have an ample supply of test kits and they were reported as inaccurate last week. If the were going to provide each state and local health departments with testing capabilities, this might be a signal that test kits developed in the private sector will be distributed.

-

**Looking Forward to Next Week**

IMO, the virus news this weekend will be off the charts. As new outbreaks occur and the sustained outbreaks continue, the demand for these corona virus stocks will rise. 

I still stand by the recommendation from my initial posting, in which I suggested investing into the companies producing test kits and personal protection / medical equipment. 

I am still currently holding $APT, $AHPI, and $CODX. No vaccine companies at the moment. I feel that there is a great deal of profit to be made swinging these stocks using 15 second candle chart &amp; the 50, 100, and 200 day moving average. Take a look at how the stock behaved the last two days and find a plan that can work for you. Watch the volume in premarket as well on the various virus stock to get a sense of where the interest is for that day.

My Portfolio Breakdown:

* 65.5% AHPI: On Friday AHPI reached a crazy premarket high of $67 a share. Upon market opening, price dropped steaply down to $16. Looks to be continuing along a trend line for now. The reason I increased my holding % here is because the float is considerably smaller than APT. https://imgur.com/u9BO2UY

* 6.3% APT: Similarly to AHPI, the price reached a big high premarket and corrected its self to the support from 2/27. https://imgur.com/orOnmri

* 28.2% CODX: Big swings here. Had been previously following the 50 day moving average and corrected down to the 200 day / trend line. Still waiting on FDA approval or PR from the company on order numbers. Will sell upon receiving FDA approval for their test kits. https://imgur.com/MTTw8Y1

I always hear people say ""If you think your taxes will be higher after retirement go with a Roth, and if you think they will be lower go with a traditional."" but to me this makes almost no sense at all. 

Lets say two people that make the same amount of money put in 5k a year into a retirement account. person A goes with a traditional account, and person B goes with a Roth.

after 20 years they each put 100k into their accounts, and lets say they each picked the same exact things and the accounts are now worth 500k each. 

person A didn't pay any taxes on those 100k, which saved them maybe 15k-25K in taxes over the years. but now, when they start drawing money from their account. it will all be taxed. all 500k of it. which might cost them anywhere from 75k-125k in taxes

Person B payed all the taxes on those 100k contributions, which cost them maybe 15-25k in taxes over the years. but now, when they start drawing money from their account. it wont be taxed at all. none of the 500K will have any tax whatsoever. 

so why in the hell would you take a possible 100K hit in the long term just to save yourself maybe 1K a year in taxes? it makes absolutely no fricken sense to me at all. Yet i see people weighing the pros and cons and they never ever bring this example up. Why aren't they shouting from the rooftops ""go with a Roth ya stupid bastard!"" instead of acting as if they are practically the same?

It's a way of controlling the correction. When you're out of tools like quantitative easing, lowering interest rates, shipknapping, trade wars etc focus needs to be directed something that impacts everybody... something like health.

Daily media releases dictate the markets more often than not. We're talking about a virus with a very similar mortality rate to influenza (2.1% ish) that only really impacts people over the age of 59 with pre existing medical conditions. Use mortality rates outside of a country with 1.4 billion people and the mortality rate goes through the floor. The world is clearly heavily reliant on China's production of goods.

Poorer regions are hit hardest and the province of Hubei had nowhere near enough beds in hospitals to deal with an outbreak. Combine this with a lockdown and the elderly didn't stand a chance (hence the higher mortality rate than almost anywhere else)

You'll see today the Dow will erase the morning losses and hit around 25,400 after the article posted at 10am proclaiming ""China goes back to work - sort of as new cases of Covid-19 wanes""

Corrections are healthy parts of market cycles. The danger of Covid-19 is a reason for markets to drop and the removal of this threat will be the reason they climb back to pre-virus levels. This does a couple of things:

Prevents an uncontrollable natural correction

Lowers the expectations on earnings reports making them easier to attain

Satisfies the markets cycle

Creates buying opportunities (not many buying at all time highs) and shorting opportunities

Distracts from the fact that growth stocks had lost their minds!

I'm sure there's lots more but I think this comment is long enough.

Edit: I forgot to mention no stocks are really moving on fundamentals or failures it's simply market movement.

Edit 2: I think gold prices aren't going up because that's the obvious safe haven. It's already climbed whilst markets were on a steady trajectory which doesn't usually occur. The people that own a lot of gold are taking profits they couldn't otherwise take as again not many people are buying at almost ATH's (with the exception of 2011 at around $1850)

Gold also hasn't corrected to pre 2008 levels while the stocks have been on an almost 12 year bull run which again is unusual.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,324455,public,confidence,self,Looking for some feedback on a tin foil hat theory,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fb2414/looking_for_some_feedback_on_a_tin_foil_hat_theory/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a 15 year old who has been interested in investing for a while, but is just now being allowed to invest. I have a few questions.

Firstly, I have about $2k open that I can invest. 

My purpose is twofold. One I want to make some cash in the short term (next year or 2) for a car when I get my license (I'm obsessed with cars)

However, I also want some medium to long term returns (7-10 years) to dip into in college for expenses, and loan debt and such.

I was thinking of starting with a custodial account rather than a super long term IRA so that I have these shorter term options....Is this the right path?

Secondly, for the longer term (where most of my cash will be tied up) I was thinking of investing in some safer, diverse funds, specifically DOW and S&amp;P. Is this the best way to generate good returns over that time, without a super high risk, or are there better ways. I am willing to accept some reasonable level of risk as long as the reward is relatively high, but I at least want to be pretty sure of making money, even if I have to hold it longer than that time.

For the shorter term it gets a little more complicated. Obviously there are some great growth stocks that will be falling in the coming weeks. However, I would only be able to buy one or two shares of something like tesla, or one share of something amazon or alphabet with no money in a safer index fund. Microsoft and apple are some I've been watching and they both look like good buys in the coming weeks. ICCC and gilead are also looking attractive, ICCC because it already has a coronavirus vaccine for animals, and gilead becasue it has already started human drug trials, both good signs of lots of business and therefore revenue while this pandemic lasts. XOM is also down a lot, but I'm worried it will never really go back up as we move towards sustainable energy and if Bernie is elected.

Are any of these good ideas, should I put it all into short term growth stocks or all into long term funds? Should I fuck it all and do a custodial roth IRA for when I want to retire? Are there something I haven't though about that would be great ideas?

I'm pretty newby but will to do research and make informed decisions

THanks for your time

* Trump botching up Corona response (cut CDC funds for the stupid wall, Muzzling CDC &amp; Health authorities in a shitty attempt to keep confidence and markets up, not reacting aggressively and professionally enough, putting Pence who is a religious zealot who has a poor track record in even believing in science in charge etc..) is seen as hurting his re-election chances.
* And increasing the chances of Sanders who is the defacto front runner
* !Silver lining is it seems JoE still has the black vote and a big win in SC would be encouraging and would def help stonks.
* [https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election)
* Another very serious issue is the potential implosion of the $XLE complex. if you've looked at a chart of energy stocks lately u will notice that it looks like they are going to 0. if oil curve stays like this and given the maturity wall that we are facing in the next 3-6 months (It means that a ton of $XLE companies have credits maturing which need to be refinanced and oil being so low makes it complicated to hedge future production in order to secure the credit)
* This one big reason why the FED SHOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND ASAP THIS IS BAD BAD BAD. bunch of bankruptcies around permian ARE NOT WELCOME right now.
* Second reason why FED SHOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND ASAP is that the spread between the 2yr interest rate and fed funds has been inverted for a month and honestly there are enough good reasons to cut the rate : Inflation missing, VERY strong $ is killing EM &amp; friends (and not helping europe so might as well help those who can be helped), stop nuking the banks. hopefully Clarida recognizes this soon.
* Corona : i don't think the whole Corona thing will ever be as big as some claim, most of my conclusions have been shaped after listening to various experts but especially this JH conference on the subject watch?v=i6cQ5Pqqa3k
* My base case is that this will become a seasonal type flu that is more severe than the flu but not quite comparable to anything like SARS or MERS (or EBOLA). and we will move on. However in the meantime this can induce a demand choc which will be temporary at worst\*Turkish / Russia conflict in ME : this is low key so far.
* Turkish / Russia conflict in ME : this is low key so far.

\*\*So it all hinges on whether you believe that the FED will do the right thing or not. i think they will so i bought &lt; 2900 in futures today.but of course we won't be able to rally until they officially change their mind or suggest it in the wires.\*\*one other trade you can do is Calls on $SHY as a play on eurodollar futures but i don't know how the strikes would work around fed funds pricing.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,323748,public,confidence,self,Market might not be going down for why you think it is,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fat679/market_might_not_be_going_down_for_why_you_think/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently there is an outage on issuing orders with Wealthsimple that just happens to coincide with this stonk sale we seem to be having. Now i dont have a lot of cash right now so it doesnt make a big difference to me at this point, however, moving forward i would like a brokerage that can perform its sole function even when the market is being volatile. Im prepared to pay a commission for this security. I was looking at questrade, which was my second place option when i decided to go with Wealthsimple.

So i guess my main question is: is questrade functional right now? Do they also experience these outages? If so what other options exist? I tried to google this but i wasnt able to get the answers im looking for. Im probably just not searching for the right keywords.

Hi,

I've  been looking to open a put position before super Tuesday and for the  general election for a while few months now, and have been looking to do  it thru USA-focused pharma stocks, but now with the corona virus taking  hold I've changed my aim and am thinking of US healthcare stocks like  UNH, the biggest US insurer. In the next 3-6 months, I think there is no  way the corona virus won't spread like wildfire. If China couldn't stop  it through large quarantine, the rest of the world is not equipped at  all. Maybe it's equipped, but no elected politician wants to take any  drastic measure until desperately required. How many incubating cases  are there already? The guy in Brazil walked around festivals for 5 days  before he knew he had it, people in the USA used UBER and walked around.  That will mean lots hospitalized people, doctor appointments,  prescriptions, potential anti-virus. In the US more so, that means a  shit ton of money, which the healthcare companies will have to cover.  Straight out of UNH's 10-K's risk factors :

&gt;We generally use approximately **80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services**  delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends  in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively  manage medical costs. \[...\] **Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues**.  If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage  the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of  operations could be materially and adversely affected.   \[...\]   Relatively small differences between **predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates**  as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our  financial results. For example, if our 2019 medical costs for commercial  insured products had been **1% higher**  than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues  from such products, our annual net earnings for 2019 would have been  reduced by approximately **$320 million \[$13.2B 2019 total, \~2.3%\]**, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs.

Am  I mistaken in assuming a cost explosion for UNH should the corona be  epidemic in the US? The two flaws I can imagine would be that they are  such crooks it won't even materialize in their quarterlies (is it even  possible?), the other, more morbid but nonetheless, if it goes wild a  fair amount of senior people will die, decreasing medium-term costs  (will the markets see an epidemic as a positive? it can be vile). That's  ignoring broad market declines which will bring it down with it if they  continue.

Ever since 2016 I  thought Bernie will roll into office in 2020, and now I'm even more  confident in it. I don't mind talking about why but it's not the point  of this. Should he become POTUS, or should the market thinks he will  (for example a blowout Super Tuesday and other candidates dropping out,  continued favorable polls in the general), will it be bearish for  healthcare stocks?

[Here is](https://i.imgur.com/GCuF1TS.png)  UNH's TTM revenue and net income from 2006 to 2020, the red line is  Trump's office. FWIW, that's an about 80% income increase as opposed to  some 30% for the S&amp;P 500, so clearly the Trump years were more  lucrative than Obama years despite Medicare and Medicaid increasing in  coverage, which justified the stock price jumping from 160 to 300 (now  250). Now I get that Trump had full house and senate to rule at his  pleasure, and Bernie will be fighting an uphill battle if elected, but  I'll be shocked if he achieves zero in 4 years on healthcare, or if the  market doesn't believe he will.

Thoughts? What am I missing? Otherwise, any better healthcare put targets?

For non-leveraged BUY stock positions, there are no rollover fees.

For leveraged BUY stock positions and SELL stock positions, the daily fee is calculated based on the size of the trade (in units), as follows:

 

BUY Position: Annual interest of 6.4% + 1-Month LIBOR, divided by 365 and multiplied by the opening BUY price

SELL Position: Annual interest of 2.9% + 1-Month LIBOR, divided by 365 and multiplied by the opening SELL price

 

Let's take a BUY investment of 10 units in AAPL as an example. At the time of writing, the 1-month LIBOR is at 1.55%, and the BUY price of AAPL is $174.00.

(6.4% + 1.55%) / 365 * $174.00 = $0.03790 per unit

x 10 units = $0.38 daily for this trade

 

Now let's see an example of a SELL investment of 10 units in AAPL. At the time of writing, the 1 month LIBOR is at 1.55%, and the SELL price of AAPL is $173.67.

(2.9% + 1.55%) / 365 * $173.67 = $0.02117 per unit

x 10 units = $0.21 daily for this trade

I fundamentally disagree with this theory. The reality is that for too long, 12 years to be exact  since the collapse of 2008, the world economies have been driven almost exclusively by endless amounts of Central banks induced credits and government policies aimed at quick fixing the economy by subsidizing certain industries at the expenses of real consumers demands. 

The boom in stocks and bonds, which has only benefited a tiny number of industries and  companies has not really been translated into into an improvement in living standards among the masses. The rises in ultra right-wing and socialist-lite politicians demonstrate that disconnect between the masses and the mainstream elite; especially as far as the economy is concerned.
Wallstreet has been a direct beneficiary with subsidies at near zero interest rates, taxes cuts, and bailouts while mainstreet is still reeling under the effects of the real estate crisis of 2008. 
There was indeed a boom and even a sense prosperity; but, only the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Mark Zuckerberg can tell you about it.( None of this CEO pays a dime in dividends to his stockholders) 

Why should investors welcome a market crash? 
Because Wallstreet is a fiend that needs its daily dose of heroin-credit in order to survive. The prices reflected on the various indexes do not reflect true investors and market participant expectations, but rather the rate of expectation  that the Fed will continue to use its credit seringe to sustain the illusory prosperity-high. Such process in the long term is Unsustainable, and if history teaches us anything, it is that ultimately there is always a day of reckoning. 
A stock market crash will rebalance and hopefully reset facts from fiction; cleanse the market of capital wasteful Enterprises, equilibrate asset prices, labor, and investments in accordance with consumer demands rather than government policies, thus setting the ground for a sounder more balanced growth in the future. 

Now, as any former addict would tell you, going cold turkey is absolutely painful, almost unbearable. But, in order to move forward and rebuild a solid foundation for the future, such sacrifice is  necessary. Prices are too high across the board, inflation is rampant despite the official number pretending the contrary. The people are struggling with debt loads while their professional  prospects are dwindling every year. 

The market economy has been taken out of the hands of its most effective drivers, entrepreneurs and consumers, and gifted into the hands of unproductive resource extractors, big banks and central bankers. It is therefore urgent to return the economy to those who work, save, and invest. For that to occur, bankrupting inefficient institutions cannot be avoided. For one Wallstreet is too big, speculation too rampant, and rates of  capital waste almost unthinkable decades ago have become a norm (Uber, wework... Etc) 

Instead of fearing a market crash, people should be cheering for it. The recession the bust is nothing but a healing healthy and curative market process. More importantly, the recession should be allowed to proceed uninterrupted by  ""rescues"" packages and bailouts as we witnessed in the past.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,321740,public,confidence,self,Market corrections are healthy and necessary.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fa5jvt/market_corrections_are_healthy_and_necessary/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*\** ***We only send recommendations from analysts whose recommendations return an average of greater than 5% in the 30 days following their recommendations.****\**

Obviously the market is in a crazy flux with concerns about the coronavirus, but that didn’t stop analysts from making their recommendations.

Yesterday we had 1 Initiated Buy, 2 Maintain Buys, and 1 Maintain Sell.

Recommendations

**Etzer Darout - Guggenheim - Rank 36 - Initiated Buy for Xencor (**[**$XNCR**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XNCR/)**)**

Etzer is an analyst at Guggenheim who only started putting out recommendations 5 months ago. However, he is quickly making a name for himself with his 62% success rate (8/13) and a 27% average return within 30 days of making his recommendations. His best return so far has been his recommendations for [Forty Seven, Inc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FTSV/) which have returned 313% in total and 236% within the first month of his recommendation. TipRanks has him currently ranked as the 36th best analyst in the US.

Yesterday, Etzer initiated a buy for Xencor ([$XNCR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XNCR/)) with a price target of $44. Xencor took a beating over the last couple of days due to coronavirus scares, so this represents a 37% upside over its current price of $32.09.

**JP McKim - Piper Sandler - Rank 44 - Maintained Buy for Tandem Diabetes Care (**[**$TNDM**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TNDM/)**)**

JP is an analyst at Oppenheimer who has been putting out recommendations for about 2 years now. JP has been putting out recommendations for 2 years now and has a 63% success rate (47/74) and an average return of 6.3% 1 month after making his recommendations. His best return so far has been his recommendations for Tandem Diabetes Care ([$TNDM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TNDM/)) - the same stock he is recommending now. He has returned 491% in total and 77% within 30 days of recommending Tandem. TipRanks currently ranks his as the 44th best analyst in the US.

JP is Maintaining his Buy recommendation for Tandem Diabetes Care ([$TNDM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TNDM/)) with a price target of $90 which represents a 15.5% upside over its current price of $77.94

**Leland Gershell - Oppenheimer - Rank 66 - Maintained Sell for Amarin (**[**$AMRN**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMRN/)**)**

Leland is an analyst at Oppenheimer who has been putting out recommendations for about 2 years now. Even though he touts a pretty low success rate of 45% (52/115) compared to these other top analysts, he has an average return of 17% within 30 days of making his recommendations. His best return so far has been his recommendations for [Agile Therapeutics](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGRX/) which have returned an insane 724% in total and 467% within the first month of his recommendation. Even though he is not as consistent as some other top analysts, TipRanks still has him currently ranked as the 66th best analyst in the US.

Yesterday, Leland maintained his sell position for Amarin ([$AMRN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMRN/)) with a price target of $13.

I bought my first stock a few days ago, and it was Samsung Electronics. I didn't buy it only because I'm South Korean. For my first stock, I wanted to buy a healthy South Korean stock. And Samsung was the first one that popped up in my mind for a few reasons.

First of all, I assume that most people know about Samsung. At least, they have seen its products. Research says the company's sales of smartphones and TV accounted for more than 20% and 30%, respectively, in the global market in Q3 2019. More specifically, it sells the most smartphones and TVs than any other company. That alone is worth investing in.

Furthermore, Samsung is more than just a giant conglomerate. It is the backbone of the South Korean economy, which is the 4th biggest in Asia. For example, the company's 2017 revenue of $224.2 billion accounted for 14.6% of the country's GDP. Even the ""Republic of Samsung"" is a nickname of the country. So, I just can't think of any other Korean company more stable than Samsung.

Lastly, I'm just a fan of Samsung products. Maybe it's just because I don't get how Apple products work, but I've always just used Samsung. So, deep down, I just wish more people would use it. That would make me look cooler.

So, for these reasons, I chose Samsung Electronics as my first ""safe,"" ""healthy"" stock. And I think the company will easily meet my expectations for a long time.

With a few UK stocks going ballistic due to China Virus activity, a glance at the US highlights a couple of shares enjoying time in the medical spotlight. Moderna &amp; Cocrystal both deserve some examination, along with a reminder prices which go up fast can equally reverse with greater brutality. 

In plain English, we're focused on  the numbers but remember checking out some fundamentals makes a lot of sense.
 



Moderna, at time of writing 24.5, has been quite encouraging, the share price needing trading beyond 26.6 dollars to enter a near term cycle to 29.29 dollars. If bettered, secondary calculates at 31.03 dollars though, to be fair, any enthusiastic publicity feels capable of driving the price to 36 dollars. We cannot calculate higher. 
  Visually, the proximity of our initial two target levels tends suggest the possibility of some hesitation around the 30 dollar mark. Any reversal needs break RED (currently 18) on the chart to justify hysterics, along with the risk of reversal to 9.95 and hopefully a rebound. 

&lt;chart goes here&gt;



 
 
 Cocrystal Pharma, presently 2.15, looks very capable of some excitement with trades now above 2.5 dollars as growth to an initial 3.69 appears possible. In the event this level is exceeded, our secondary calculates at an amazing (and therefore questionable) 5.46. Our in-house cautious nature makes us hesitant, when describing a scenario allowing 
a price to more than double but such is the nature of the current panic, it'd be churlish not to admit this possibility.

**so  for now i will try a long in Asian session. and would short into  strength in EU/US Sessions as long as Fed doesn't change it's mind.**

I'd  like to share some thoughts to help me straighten my thoughts because  this is an extremely difficult juncture. I'll try to be very concise.

Narrative  is focused 100% on a few hundred cases in some in and around Italy, for  most traders that is the beginning but in the context of the broader  implications of COVID19, if it was gonna kill US mkts it would have done  so when Wuhan quarantined 11m productive consumers and locked supply  chain for an unforeseen amount of time. Even the DAX which is extremely  exposed to Wuhan was at an ATH of 13800. instead we had a quick V shaped  dip in the US and even FXI / KWEB recovered (not without the national  team but that's another story)

My  explanation as to what was happening was that as long as bonds kept  rallying so much (TLT) it was fine to keep the equity as the central  bankers had our back and there's nothing that the nasdaq loves more than  lower real rates ($TIP &amp; $GLD)

Suddenly  the actual fed chair, Richard Clarida gave an interview to S.Liesmann  where he essentially told the mkt to back off cuz it ain't happening

📷

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/fed-vice-chair-clarida-says-its-still-too-soon-to-tell-how-much-coronavirus-will-impact-growth.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/fed-vice-chair-clarida-says-its-still-too-soon-to-tell-how-much-coronavirus-will-impact-growth.html)

he's also sending his homies to relay the same message, ie just now :

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-unclear-right-now-coronavirus-calls-for-rate-change-11582670163](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-unclear-right-now-coronavirus-calls-for-rate-change-11582670163)

📷

And  see that's a huge problem because even if you take the Nasdaq which is  the best index in the world as far as fundamentals go the valuation  doesn't make sense historically unless u consider &lt; 0 real rate that  we were pricing in. if the guy doesn't cut to where we expect him to cut  (2 cuts) then the real rate is around 50bps and we've never had Spooz  trading at 19x NTM PE with 50bps real rate and gold at 1700 suddenly  makes no sense at all.

So my thinking is that this dude spoiled the one thing which made the mkt not fall on a number of bearish items :

* Extremely strong $ which is negative to earnings for big nasdaq names
* Bank  names holding up way better than they ought to given what the curve was  doing assuming great US consumer (KRE is down 4% today)
* AAPL/SMH universe supply chain disruptions in Wuhan
* Comrade sanders gaining groud was dismissed by mkt participants as having no chance vs the Don

And now it suddenly all came to the forefront, crystallized in this italian pasta flu bullshit.

So  now what's next, i think we can have a V shaped recovery because  Chinamen have done an outstanding work containing the disease and  getting back to work asap + they have spared no effort in liquidity and  fiscal measures to help, unlike the fed here.

At  worst this becomes a more dangerous type of seasonal flu and we get on  on our lives. Nasdaq earnings for one are extremely good  but if the FED  doesn't want to help

But it won't  happen if the fed keeps pushing back against what is priced in the mkt  (&gt;2 cuts by year end)  so yeah, i have so many reasons to buy the  nasdaq here but i think it makes sense to stay prudent because unless  Clarida concedes very soon, it will soon mean that the 2yr rate will  have to get back to &gt;1.5 and it is simply impossible for equities to  rally in front of that.

Also you cannot trade here without differentiating btwn timezones:

One  thing that is certain is that Europeans came on board on the FED  argument, that's why the selling has been so harsh during EZ timezones,  in fact all of yesterday's loss came from them. US Simply managed to  keep it flat and only sold today.

Asian  seems to be the only timezone where you can express some bullishness  and i will be trying to that however there is one issue which is  extremely problematic for the Nikkei (and can pull down all indexes with  it) and that's the Tokyo Olympics, let's just say that a lot of hope  rests on it in Japan and tonight's session will depend on how they  interpret this news item

**CODX** First breakout day that has held up well - this is a great sign. Tomorrow, as long as we don't gap down below $4 in the premarket, I'll be looking to join any weakness above that level for a push at the open back over $4.50. Over $4.50 this has room towards $5.00.

**COCP** Reclaimed VWAP late day with another day trading &gt; 70M shares of volume... This is NOT done yet. Needs to holds dips &gt; the $2.15 microshelf in the morning for shorts to stay stuck -- a break over $2.60 has room towards $3.00.

**VVPR** absolutely destroyed today - watching this one tomorrow for any significant pop towards $1.90 for a day 2 fade.

**GNPX** teetering above $6 today - clearly a line in the sand for momentum. A gap up in the morning &gt; $6.50 can bring us back towards today's highs and over that we're clear. Looked weak into the close today so a breakdown under $6 will be rough for longs and will likely hit some stops until $5.50 area.

**TRCH** above $0.70 can see a move towards $0.80/$0.90 with the gap fill on the daily.

The U.S. stock market rally is unraveling, with a period of historic gains coming to a screeching halt, as fears the coronavirus epidemic may reach America rattles Wall Street.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -3.15%  was off 929.92 points, or 3.3%, at its Tuesday nadir at 27,030.88, a day after the blue-chip benchmark rang up a drop of more than 1,000 points, representing its third-worst daily point drop in the index’s 124-year history.

The Dow finished Tuesday down nearly 880 points to mark its sharpest two-session slide in point terms, about 1,910 points, for the Dow in its history, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The fall also marked the largest two-day percentage slide for the index since the period ended Feb. 5, 2018, and puts the Dow 8.4% from its Feb. 12 record close at 29,551.42. That means the Dow is approaching correction territory at 26,596.28, defined as a drop of at least 10%, but not greater than 20%, from a recent peak.

Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -3.03% index and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -2.77% all finished sharply lower. The S&amp;P 500 is off 7.6% from its recent record on Feb. 19, and has shed $1.737 trillion this week, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices in a Tuesday research note.

The Nasdaq is off 8.6% from its Feb. 19 all-time closing high. Put another way, it is 1.4% from falling into correction at 8,835.46.

Here’s are 5 reasons why the market is falling:

The company recently raised prices in its theme parks, which will help it earn more during the peak season. It would eventually bring out more value to the shareholders since people will spend more at popular parks.

Let's take a look at his story and how he became so wealthy...

Bloomberg grew up in Medford, Massachusetts, a suburban city not far from Boston. From a young age, Bloomberg demonstrated the drive and persistence that would later manifest itself.

According to his mother, ""He wanted to be the boss of whatever we were working on. He wanted to run everything.""

In high school, he knew he wanted out of his home town, citing New York as the place to be and emphasising the importance of becoming successful because ""once you had a lot of money you could do things to improve the world.""

Bloomberg attended Johns Hopkins University, where he joined the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. He graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.

In 1966, he graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA.

After he secured his MBA from Harvard, Bloomberg got a job in 1966 (the year England won the World Cup no less...) at Salomon Brothers. He worked in the so-called ""cage"" as a clerk processing trades at $9500 a year - the equivalent today of around $75K.

Bloomberg went on to become head of equity trading and sales for five years.

During his time at Salomon, Richard Levy, who was working for Bloomberg at the time, tells an interesting story regarding Bloomberg's ruthless work ethic...

Levy's grandfather had just died and the funeral was the next day - the same day that a large client was planning a heavy amount of trading.

Bloomberg said: ""‘Would you mind having them change the funeral?'”

Levy refused. Under Jewish law, burial must take place within 24 hours of death.

Bloomberg apologised two hours later.

Some years later, when Levy’s son was born, the infant was admitted to intensive care and was facing a blood transfusion.

Levy called up work and said ""I'm staying until he’s out of intensive care”

However, when he arrived home later, Bloomberg was calling: ""Where have you been?"" He asked Levy.

""I was in intensive care"" Levy replied - to which Bloomberg responded:

""No other father took time off when their kid was born.”

Bloomberg apologised to Levy years later after he had kids of his own, but Levy sums it up here:

**""He's the most brilliant guy I ever worked for, but he's the biggest bastard I ever worked for.""**

Despite potential character flaws, Bloomberg demonstrated this brilliant with the moves he made in his career...

Bloomberg was a general partner at Salomon Brothers.

He lost out in a power struggle, and was effectively demoted. As he knew a fair amount about computers, Bloomberg was put in charge of Salomon's systems.

Bloomberg stayed just long enough to collect a $10MM cash buyout of his partnership stake in the firm as Salomon went public in 1981 in a merger with Philbro. That's the equivalent of around $28MM today. Now that's certainly enough to retire, but Bloomberg had no plans for that. He wanted more.

Using this money, Bloomberg set up a data services company named Innovative Market Systems (IMS) based on his belief that Wall Street would pay a premium for high-quality business information, delivered instantaneously on computer terminals in a variety of usable formats.

The company sold customised computer terminals that delivered real-time market data, financial calculations and other analytics to Wall Street firms. These machines later became known as Bloomberg Terminals.

In 1983, Merrill Lynch became the company's first customer, investing $30 million in IMS to help finance the development of ""the Bloomberg"" terminal computer system. As of 1983, IMS was selling machines exclusively to Merrill Lynch's clients; in 1984, Merrill Lynch released IMS from this exclusive deal.

The company was then renamed Bloomberg L.P. and by 1990, it had installed 8,000 terminals.

As of October 2015, the company had more than 325,000 terminal subscribers worldwide. These subscriptions cost $24,000 per year, discounted to $20,000 for two or more.

As of 2019, Bloomberg employs 20,000 people in dozens of locations.

The company has a revenue of around $10BN.

Therefore, Bloomberg, with his 88% stake, has climbed up the net worth ranking as the number of terminal subscribers has increased over the years.

Bloomberg stated: **""There might be better traders than me, and there might be people who know more about computers. But there's nobody who knows more about both.""**

There are other things of note:

1. He was the mayor of New York City for 12 years, Bloomberg is one of just four individuals to have served that long.
2. Since signing the Giving Pledge in 2010, Bloomberg has given away $8.2BN
3. He has announced that he would sell his company if he were elected President.

I finally opened my brokerage account a few days ago. Since I've been watching a fair amount of YouTube videos and reading books about investing for the past few months, I was pretty confident. I thought I knew what I was doing. I thought I would be the next Warren Buffett. Surprise, surprise, I was not the next Warren Buffett. My brain froze immediately after I looked through my investment app. ""Where the hell do I start?"" I panicked.

Well, to be fair, I thought I've been doing my homework. I've kept track of companies that have piqued my interest in the Google Document. And I focused on companies based in East Asia and the U.S. since I know the regions better. (Specialization, right?) But the problem was, I had no specific investment strategy to begin with. Was I aiming for quick money with high risk? Was I aiming to sell my stocks at a higher price within a few months? I had to figure that out first.

Long story short, dividend investing turned out to be the most suitable strategy for me. Basically, a dividend is the money companies pay out to investors at the end of each business quarter in return for their investment. Companies do this because they think it will bring more benefits for them since dividends would encourage investors to buy more of their stocks.

So, dividend investing is a low-risk investment that could yield a steady income in the long term. Not only do you get paid regularly through a dividend, but the value of your stocks most likely to go up over time as well (under the assumption that you bought healthy stocks.) And I love the idea.

And most importantly, this investing style would fit my lifestyle too. I don't want to be too caught up with every single situation in the stock market. I just want to choose companies and invest in them no matter how the market does hourly. This way, I can still have fun doing my homework finding great companies while I don't have to worry too much about every single moment like penny stock investors or swing traders do.

Plus, I want to spend most of my time writing rather than looking at the monitor full of numbers and graphs. (I'm too stupid to understand them anyway.)  I don't think that there's going to be much space left in my head while I'm busy thinking about my writing. And also, it is better to have something backing me up financially when my job will probably make no money. 

Anyway, even though dividend investing sounds great, there are some downsides. One of them is that you have to put in a good amount of money for the long term to see a decent dividend. (No pain, no gain.) I watched a few videos of a YouTuber Andrei Jikh, who is also a dividend investor, and he's put in almost $130,000 over the last 5 years to get paid around $550 every month now. (His goal is getting a 4% dividend yield.) So, you need patience for this.

So far, I think I am going to stick to dividend investing. But I definitely want to experience a few other investing styles to just enjoy the journey of learning investment and money.

So what are the majority of factories from Hubei producing? Cars. Which ones? [The ones you've never even heard of](http://auto-che.com/p/hubei.html) such as: Hasheng Huazhou, Luba, and Huashi Bus.

[Hubei has a population of 58.5 MILLION people](https://www.google.com/search?ei=KWtUXqTmJoey0PEPw5iIiAs&amp;q=hubei+population&amp;oq=hubei+popu&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i324j0l2j0i22i30l3j0i22i10i30j0i22i30l2.30200.30653..31395...1.0..0.95.376.6......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i273.JA5Cjf-waUE). The amount of infections is already well contained. Yes, sure there are going to be people who continue to spread it to other regions around the world for sometime but it probably won't be at the same scale as Hubei given that other countries are now aware and hyper vigilant with their preparations. Developing countries who might lack adequate medical capabilities on their own are going to be assisted by the WHO.

Not long ago I released my Disney ""Due Diligence"" report  and received good feedback. As part of my ongoing research for specific tickers I went through the last 12 Starbucks (SBUX) quarterly reports and aggregated some of the data as well as noted some of the important quotes from management throughout the earnings calls.

Click here for the [full Starbucks research report](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocks/due-diligence/research/4/2020-02-24/SBUX) with all the visualized data and quotes.

As a summary, I've come up with these key points.

# Key Points

&amp;#x200B;

**1. From raw earnings data:**  
**A)** US growth is mainly derived from increased ticket prices (approximately 3-5%) and a 3% Q.O.Q store growth and not so much an increase in store traffic (transactions).  
**B)** Global and US Traffic comps have been mainly flat over the the last 9 quarters with the exception of 2019 where adding variety to their menu has displayed an increase in store traffic and transactions. Executives believe they can continue to achieve at least 1% transactional comp growth while continuing ticket comp growth in the range of 3-4%.  
**C)** Loyalty members has been steadily increasing at a rate of mid-teens Q.O.Q. Starbucks attributes this to an increase in customer engagement and a better in-store customer experience.  


**2.** Starbucks, specifically in China, is working on digitizing the industry and making deliveries more accessible. They partnered with Alibaba to make this more feasible as they see steady growth in mobile delivery orders and loyalty program members. The key feature here was to be easily accessible with Alibaba and also make it possible to join the loyalty program with only a couple of clicks.

**3.** Expanding in China at approx 150 stores per quarter or 600 per year. Expects 6,000 stores in China by the end of FY 2022. They currently operate 4,292 stores in China or 13.5% of all Starbucks locations. The locations in China generate approximately 11.5% of Starbucks  sales.

**4.** Management commented about the increase in competition from Luckin Coffee saying it is only natural. There is a large and growing addressable market for coffee in China that has just begun to get penetrated and will attract more competition. Starbucks stated that because China is largely a tea drinking culture, more competitors in the coffee industry will accelerate the overall adoption of coffee by the Chinese consumer. Starbucks argues that what is good for the industry (more competitiveness) is also very good for Starbucks.

**5.** Coronavirus will have some impact on revenues. They estimate China accounts for 10% of revenues. They will provide more transparency coming in March and closer to earnings report in April. They estimate that opening new stores contribute to approximately 80% of Starbucks revenue growth.

**6.** Most existing stores are experiencing more revenue growth from increased prices rather than an increase of traffic or transactions. Most of Starbucks revenue growth will come from creating more opportunities and opening more stores. More stores = more growth for Starbucks and China is an opportunity in this sense as they are opening stores at a rate growth rate of 16% compared to opening stores at a rate of 3% in the U.S.

Global stocks [tumbled on Monday ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/italian-stocks-set-to-lead-sharp-decline-for-european-equities-as-coronavirus-spreads-2020-02-24)as the spread of the coronavirus outside China intensified, with [Italy and South Korea reporting a spike ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/south-korea-goes-on-high-alert-over-virus-italy-battles-to-contain-outbreak-2020-02-23)in new cases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA, -3.10%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote)  lost 760 points shortly after  the open, and is now 1% down year-to-date, while the S&amp;P                                                                 [SPX, -2.90%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote) fell 2.5% in early trading and is 0.7% up so far in 2020.

The  S&amp;P 500 posted a gain of more than 20% in the three months after  the World Health Organization said it was investigating the SARS  outbreak in March 2003, according to Cowen.

However, that period  coincided with the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the early stages of an  economic expansion and cheaper stocks, Cowen equity research analysts  led by Kevin Kopelman said.

“We believe SARS was largely  overshadowed by the U.S. invasion of Iraq on Mar.19, the fall of Baghdad  on Apr.10 and end of major operations on May.1.

“When the SARS  outbreak began, the economy was also in early stages of an expansion  phase and the S&amp;P traded at 15 times price to earnings.” The S&amp;P  500 currently trades 22 times price to earnings. 

SARS  infected more than 8,000 people across 29 countries in an eight-month  period, causing 774 deaths. The coronavirus has infected close to 80,000  people, while the [death toll has risen ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/covid-19-case-tally-79339-cases-2619-deaths-2020-02-24)above  2,600. Despite the difference, China accounts for 97% of coronavirus,  whereas the SARS virus travelled further with just 66% of cases in  China.

Air travel recovered to pre-outbreak levels after six  months from the SARS epidemic but Cowen analysts predicted it would take  longer this time around.

“Even if we assume a V-shaped recovery,  as occurred in 2003 following SARS, **the market is much bigger now. In  2000, 10 million Chinese traveled outbound, in 2018 164 million did - in  our view it will take more than just six months to recover that  traffic,” Cowen analysts said.**

Demetri Kofinas speaks with two guests who have each made one prior appearance on Hidden Forces: Grant Williams and Ben Hunt. Ben is the founder of the widely read Epsilon Theory, a newsletter and website that’s become popular for its insights and analysis into markets and society with a particular focus on how narrative drives our perception of the world and our place in it. Grant is the long-time publisher of a popular financial newsletter, the host of a phenomenal sports podcast, and the co-founder of Real Vision, a financial media company that offers in-depth video interviews with some of the world's most thoughtful investors.

I have created a machine learning model for the S&amp;P 500 based on the last 50 closing prices using the machine learning software [TuringBot](https://turingbotsoftware.com/), which uses Symbolic Regression. Here is the best model (best combination of accuracy and complexity):

3177+(3.77802\*x-cos(-0.354945\*x)\*x)

and here is a super overfit one (because why not):

3183.53+(x+(2.82825\*x-(cos(1.55352\*round((-2168.07)\*(-2.50345+x)))\*(x+tan(-0.218616\*x)))))-(72.6919/x)

This is what they look like: [simple model](https://turingbotsoftware.com/images/spx_feb24_simple.png), [super overfit model](https://turingbotsoftware.com/images/spx_feb24_overfit.png)

In both cases, the variable x represents the day and is currently 50. To predict the next values, we just plug the next integers into the formula. From that we get the following for the next 5 trading days:

    Monday    3332.27 3332.02
    Tuesday   3325.41 3331.33
    Wednesday 3324.27 3331.38
    Thursday  3329.71 3334.09
    Friday    3341.76 3339.89

Even though all the major blue-chip ""analysts"" say they use fundamental analysis, they really just use financial analysis with some growth rates thrown in.

Here are two different examples of the two:

**Financial Analysis:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIlcRqgXSgU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIlcRqgXSgU)

**Fundamental Analysis:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O\_H93Zu5Idk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_H93Zu5Idk) 

Even though the financial analysis sounds much more fancy and precise, the very high-level fundamental analysis does a better job of actually explaining how the current price of TSLA could possibly be justified. 

The financial analysis relies on **vague**, sparsely-justified growth rates, but this vagueness is obfuscated by the precise way in which it shows **exactly** what the stock price should be in the future given such future earnings.

The fundamental analysis, on the other hand, **very loosely** attaches economic value to certain growth targets, but **more accurately** show WHY growth can happen within certain bounds. Hence, even though the fundamental analysis is much less precise, it ends up being far more useful in explaining the real economic forces at work that are changing future expectations about Tesla's earnings, and hence its stock price.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,318702,public,confidence,self,Fundamental vs Financial Analysis (TSLA),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/f8itn1/fundamental_vs_financial_analysis_tsla/,all_ads,6,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'mdmxGeD9gyACEshp1H7kP6HEm7B5RqVGWmWMn9G2QgU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fiDmJsTMQxkFgv1AG1CQRd9YpszfRvjSDqiJGjNZP0k.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b52422653ed06f96e54d38a58df30ac0631d11a', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fiDmJsTMQxkFgv1AG1CQRd9YpszfRvjSDqiJGjNZP0k.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc86ae9abda7cb3a3dab67200ddaa2bce9c0af79', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fiDmJsTMQxkFgv1AG1CQRd9YpszfRvjSDqiJGjNZP0k.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=727a4ec005f0042bad49f746a8a69c3458e01939', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fiDmJsTMQxkFgv1AG1CQRd9YpszfRvjSDqiJGjNZP0k.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=171f38201931e5901f97942c215ec966997fcc07', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

The primary goal of this account was to swing trade lower priced stocks ranging from $0.25 - $10/share. I have been trading for close to 10 years and my primary strategy of trading is through technical analysis. I don’t trade a lot of stocks, at max I may trade 2-3 in a week. But as most of the experienced traders know, as you trade for longer amounts of time you become more disciplined and refine your skill set as you go. So on the weekends I would screen for stocks and study charts I liked for the following week then look for entries early in the week. I stick to a strict stop loss level based off the chart or a percentage I am willing to risk and am always looking for at least a 5% gain from my entry before I consider an exit point. I also allocated roughly 25% of my account balance to each trade I made. At this time that equated to about $1,500 per trade. This strategy has worked well for me for a long time so my goal was to do this consistently and see what I can turn the starting $6,000 into. I traded throughout 2018 with the occasional couple week break here or there. By the end of February 2019 my account was over $10,000. I thought, not bad for trading sub $10 stocks and capturing 5% to 10% on most trades. There were the occasional trades that would capture more than that but I wanted to stick as close to my strategy as I could and ensure I was staying disciplined. So February 2019 comes around and I have a balance in my account of just over $10,000 so I now am allocated roughly $2,500 per trade I make. Still sticking to my strategy of having a tight stop loss, smart charting analysis, and looking for 5%-10% profit on each trade. Of course there are losses sprinkled throughout but they are far outweighed by the many wins taken throughout the year.

So then comes February 2020, looking at my account as it currently sits at $21, 327. My account growth from 2018 to 2019 was over 70% and my account growth from 2019 to 2020 was over 108%! At this point I am 2 years into this trading strategy and would like to document year three to see if I can replicate it again and get this account to 30k-40k by February 2021.

So I plan on starting next week (Feb. 24th 2020) to see what I can make of this account another year into the journey. Except this time I want to provide monthly recaps of the stocks I traded and how those trades played out and keep a running breakdown of my account balances and what stocks I am trading currently. I think it will be cool, (especially if the account goes up a good bit this year) to look back at the analysis and monthly breakdowns and see how the performance was. These first two years I haven’t really documented much or done much analysis on my account so I would love to do that this year and share it with everyone.

I do share charts and the trades I am getting into as well as when I get in the trades and at what price on my twitter account: [https://twitter.com/thebreadmakerr](https://twitter.com/thebreadmakerr) if you want to follow along and see what I am up to daily. I plan on providing weekly recaps on my twitter account and then deeper monthly recaps and sharing them on twitter. i will breakdown the wins, losses, and be as transparent as possible about my account and how it is progressing. Hopefully you enjoyed this story and want to follow along, I am excited to see how it goes! Thanks for listening!

TL;DR: Funded an account in 2018 with $6,000. Trading stocks under $10 a share and trading based off of technical analysis. Turned the $6,000 into $10,000 in year one and turned the $10,000 into $21,000 in year two. Starting year three on Monday Feb. 24th and would like to document my progress and trades I make on my Twitter account and have monthly updates on Reddit to see if I can double this $21k I am going into year three starting with.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,318686,public,confidence,self,Documenting Stock Trading Journey 2020,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/f8ij29/documenting_stock_trading_journey_2020/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We’ve seen the Dow Jones increase from 7,550.29 to 19,804.72 under the Obama administration and from 19,804.72 to 29,102.51 under the Trump administration; meanwhile, Americans have seen stagnant wages when adjusting for inflation for the last 40 years and union membership is at a 75-year low.

Now to be fair to the stock market, a rising stock market is usually aligned with a growing economy and leads to greater investor confidence. Investor confidence in stocks leads to more buying activity which can also help push stock prices higher. When stocks rise, people invested in the equity markets gain wealth. This increased wealth often leads to increased consumer spending, as consumers buy more goods and services when they're confident they are in a financial position to do so. When consumers buy more, businesses that sell those goods and services choose to produce more and sell more.

With this being said, I've found a tool that I started using before my dashboard creation process to highlight relationships between my data for further investigation. This tool is [D-Tale](https://github.com/man-group/dtale) a python, react, flask library that's built off Plotly &amp; Dash to allows easy data analysis and integrates easily into Jupiter notebook.

As a fan, I wanted to put together a practice &amp; tutorial on how to use this powerful tool in a comprehensive way so I made this video where I take the [Coingecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#/) to pull all cryptocurrency financial data by date &amp; break it down into price, volume &amp; market cap. Easily adaptable to an endless amount of cryptocurrencies to compare with each other on this tool.

# **Coronavirus fears spoiled a solid earnings season and will further dominate markets ahead’  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-fears-ruin-solid-earnings-season-and-cloud-growth-picture.html)**
*****
&gt; The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.
*****
&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.
*****
&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.
*****
&gt; “The virus is totally underrated,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on Friday.“What I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we’re paying too much for stocks.”
*****
&gt; # ‘More cautious than usual’
&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.
*****
&gt; “While guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,” Subramanian said in a note.
*****
&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies’ average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.
*****
&gt; As of Friday, China’s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is “very worrisome.”
*****
&gt; “Lost in those headlines is corporate America’s impressive performance this earnings season,” John Lynch, LPL Financial’s chief investment strategist, said in a note. “Companies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.”

# Earnings Season Observations

&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America’s impressive performance this earnings season.

&gt; “Companies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Despite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.” The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:

&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn’t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.
&gt; * ** Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.
&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies’ resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.

# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines

&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.

&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ’s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980’s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.

# Performance Throughout The Presidencies

&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**

&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.

# Yet Another Corona Friday

&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another ""Corona Friday"". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time. Try Bespoke's premium research package for free for two weeks.

# New All-Time Highs for S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ – Well Above Average Gains in Election Year

&gt; As of today’s close, DJIA is up 2.84%, S&amp;P 500 +4.81% and NASDAQ is up a whopping 9.41% year-to-date. All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ’s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.

# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)

&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.

&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.

&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.

&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!

&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.

That should happen by April 2020. Then another 3 months to test those satellites and raise them to their proper orbits. That would be July 2020 approx.

I suspect that SpaceX will launch a website in the coming months for pre-orders. Just about everyone using HughesNet (EchoStar) and Viasat is planning to switch ASAP.

Since we cannot invest in SpaceX/Starlink, the other idea is to short the stock of the competitors that will lose customers due to Starlink.

EchoStar/HughesNet (stock symbol: SATS) and Viasat (stock symbol: VSAT) also.

The day that Starlink opens their website for pre-orders, and Elon tweets about it, I expect VSAT and SATS to crash in the stock market.

Every Starlink launch each 2-3 weeks prompts news stories and a reminder that it is coming. Wall Street will be waking up to the threat this poses to competitors.

HughesNet (Echostar) has 1.4 million satellite internet customers in North America. Most of their revenue comes from this. (stock symbol: SATS)

Viasat has 1.2 million satellite internet customers in North America. About 60% to 70% of their revenue comes from this. Also, Vianet has $1.9 billion in junk rated debt and very little cash in the bank. (stock symbol: VSAT)

Here is an idea ... Short them. The market is so over valued that they are likely to go down regardless. But the added competition from Starlink will crush their profits and revenue over the next few years.

In my 2010 book, [**“Crisis Economics,”**](https://books.google.com/books/about/Crisis_Economics.html?id=oQoNLVqZzQYC) I defined financial crises not as the “black swan” events that Nassim Nicholas Taleb described in [**his eponymous bestseller,**](http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/176226/) but as “white swans.”

According to Taleb, black swans are events that emerge unpredictably, like a tornado, from a fat-tailed statistical distribution. But I argued that financial crises, at least, are more like hurricanes: They are the predictable result of built-up economic and financial vulnerabilities and policy mistakes.

There are times when we should expect the system to reach a tipping point — the “Minsky Moment” — when a boom and a bubble turn into a crash and a bust. Such events are not about the “unknown unknowns” but rather the “known unknowns.”

&gt;***Financial markets remain blissfully in denial of the many predictable global crises that could come to a head this year, particularly in the months before the U.S. presidential election. In addition to the increasingly obvious risks associated with climate change, at least four countries want to destabilize the US from within.***

Beyond the usual economic and policy risks that most financial analysts worry about, a number of potentially seismic white swans are visible on the horizon this year. Any of them could trigger severe economic, financial, political and geopolitical disturbances unlike anything since the 2008 crisis.

**Four Powers**

For starters, the United States is locked in an escalating strategic rivalry with at least four implicitly aligned revisionist powers: **China, Russia, Iran and North Korea**. These countries all have an interest in challenging the U.S.-led global order, and 2020 could be a critical year for them, owing to the U.S. presidential election and the potential change in U.S. global policies that could follow.

Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. is trying to contain or even trigger regime change in these four countries through economic sanctions and other means. Similarly, the four revisionists want to undercut American hard and soft power abroad by destabilizing the U.S. from within through asymmetric warfare.

If the U.S. election descends into partisan rancor, chaos, disputed vote tallies and accusations of “rigged” elections, so much the better for America’s rivals. A breakdown of the U.S. political system would weaken American power abroad.

Moreover, some countries have a particular interest in removing Trump.

The acute threat that he poses to the Iranian regime gives it [**every reason to escalate the conflict** ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-stock-market-is-delusional-if-it-thinks-the-risks-from-iran-are-gone-2020-01-14)with the U.S. in the coming months — even if it means risking a full-scale war — on the chance that the ensuing spike in oil prices [**CL.1,** **-0.78%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/cl.1?mod=MW_story_quote)would crash the U.S. stock market [**DJIA,** **-0.78%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) [**SPX,** **-1.05%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote)  , trigger a recession and sink Trump’s re-election prospects.

Yes, [**the consensus view**](https://www.project-syndicate.org/bigpicture/after-suleimani?barrier=accesspaylog) is that the targeted killing of Qassem Soleimani has deterred Iran, but that argument misunderstands the regime’s perverse incentives. War between U.S. and Iran is likely this year; the current calm is the one before the proverbial storm.

**Houston** – A prominent and [well know energy investor](https://thestonkmarket.com/2020/02/13/bradley-holly-named-the-stonk-markets-sexiest-ceo-alive-for-2020/) has been arrested by the Houston Police Department for taking a fresh dump at over 60 energy company headquarters across the state of Texas.  The energy investor told authorities after losing so much money in the energy industry for the past 10 years the only thing left to do was to take shits in all of the crappy energy companies he was invested in. “It was the only way to show those overpaid capital destroyers how shitty their assets and business models really were.” The Stonk Market team was the first on scene…

“I was minding my own business this morning when I smelled something so rank, I puked in my mouth,” a security guard at Breken Resources stated. “When I looked to my right there was a well-dressed man with his pants to his knees squatting down and taking a shit right in the middle of our floor.”

[There were reports](https://thestonkmarket.com/2020/02/19/hedge-fund-manager-claims-tesla-is-deep-value-with-infinite-total-addressable-market/) all over downtown Houston of this same story – a man taking a fresh dump in a beaten down energy company headquarters, then running out of the place with his pants halfway down to his knees, screaming obscurities about how he was broke and bankrupt.

The Sheriff of the Houston Police department said their first suspect was a Green Party activist.  But when they caught the man, who was taking fresh ones they were shocked beyond belief.

The man was caught at [Bayler Energy Resources ](https://thestonkmarket.com/2020/02/19/23-ways-to-know-you-are-invested-in-a-value-trap/)after taking a dump when a local hero tackled him.

“That was the biggest dump I have ever laid my eyes on,” a woman on the scene said. “I never thought in my wildest dreams a man could push a turd out of that size and capacity.”

The woman mentioned that after she shockingly saw the massive fresh turd on the floor she caught out of the corner of her eye a man with his pants to his knees screaming how the “back-half” of the year free cash flows never came. When the man squatted down for a second dump the local hero tackled the man and held him down until authorities arrived on scene.

The man who was taking fresh dumps all over Houston is a well known energy analyst known for his horrible calls on the entire energy industry. After losing his clients money year after year investing in the energy space the man took it upon himself to pay the energy companies he invested in with a little visit. In total the man took fresh dumps in 64 energy companies headquarters this afternoon. We spoke with the energy analyst briefly.

“I was sick and tired of these overpaid executives over-promising and vastly under-delivering. ‘In the back-half we will generate cash flows’ those crooked executives would always say. Well you know what? The back-half never came. There was always more ‘growth capex’. Frankly, I just got sick of it. After losing my clients an untold amount of money the only thing left to do was to show these energy companies what pieces of shit they were!”

Apparently after you lose your clients money the only thing left to do is to take fresh dumps everywhere.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center of Veterinary Medicine on Friday approved ZM-007 Metronidazole Oral Suspension and ZM-012 Metronidazole Tablet. This will provide new and easier ways to treat companion animals.

ZM-012 is a canine-specific tablet formulation to replace the large, bitter-tasting generic tablet designed for humans. ZM-007 is an oral suspension formulation that provides veterinarians the ability to accurately dose smaller breeds and puppies without compounding pharmacies.

Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (ZOM) developed these formulations to establish safe and effective doses of metronidazole to treat diarrhea in dogs, rather than relying on efficacy and safety data extrapolated from human studies and using tablets or suspensions produced for human use.

Marketing on these newly approved drugs is estimated to start in Q1 2021 and analysts estimate the drugs could generate annual sales of $1.2 billion by 2027.

Stocks have benefited from a view that the world’s central bankers will continue to offer a cushion with easy monetary conditions—and in the case of China, large amounts of stimulus—if the fallout from the coronavirus continues to spread. The S&amp;P 500 is up 5% so far this year, while the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets index exchange-traded fund (ticker: EEM) is down just 1%, even as millions are quarantined and millions more are under travel restrictions that have brought China’s economy to a virtual halt that has yet to lift.

In a note to clients sent Thursday, Gavekal Research’s Tan Kai Xian outlined **three potential problems for U.S. stocks** as companies like Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (SBUX), and Walt Disney (DIS) face a hit to their businesses. “The worry is that investors will look beyond supportive liquidity conditions and start asking more fundamental questions,” he writes, adding that it is likely that U.S. earnings growth will stay weak in the first half amid virus-induced disruption.

Even if economic growth rebounds in the second half of the year, as most expect, Kai Xian says companies will likely see a margin hit, given a tight labor market, that could make the eventual earnings recovery “modest at best.” While the analyst describes himself as a “circumspect U.S. equity bull” because profits will be positive even if they are soft, he outlines three possible problems weak profits could cause:

* Softer profits could mean fewer stock buybacks. “When profits are high it makes sense to trim equity and keep a steady debt-to-equity ratio. This is why profit changes tend to lead corporate buybacks by two quarters,” he writes.
* Analysts will likely have to lower profit estimates, as reported earnings have fallen by more than expected. Though there were fewer earnings downgrades last year despite the trade war and other concerns, Kai Xian says the market is now vulnerable to recalibration of earnings outlooks.
* Weaker profits means more concerns about insolvency. Though a spike in bankruptcies is unlikely, corporate fundamentals could still deteriorate and make companies more reliant on global central bank liquidity, he writes.

Does this mean the end of the bull market? The Gavekal analyst doesn’t think so, but he sees the concerns as a reason for investors to reduce any overweight to growth stocks and take a more neutral stance between growth and value.

in the past months I have been working hard to find an algorithm to make money in the stock market.

Well... I think I found one.
At least I simulated it for 3 years and it worked well.

Well the thing is, it works the best when I bet all my money in 1 stock, and keep reinvesting everything on the next one.

However I am scared about implementing it in real life, for a couple of reasons:

-this is short term trading, so I am afraid the bid-ask spread will fuck it up. Since I do many trades throughout the year, the multiple sums have a huge effect. But I tried to take this into consideration and even add some more to the spread (0.2%), just to be safer in the results. 
Unfortunatly, it is very difficult to find data on the spread. I can get the spread of today, but I cant get the spread on a past time (at least that I know).

-My 2nd concern is the fact that I am putting all-in in 1 stock. There is the risk of it losing 50% from 1 day to the other. Although the EV of my algorithm is positive, there is always this risk.

I would much rather not to put all-in. Maybe 50%. And somedays distribute it by 2 stocks.

I did try this technique, and it still gave positive results, however they weren't that exciting. (a return of 100% in 3 years, adding 0.2% to the spread just to be more cautious). And I feel that I may be able to do it by myself, with long-term investing.

So, I am on a spot, where I really want to try the version of my algorithm that yields the best results. But I am very scared of the risks associated to it. It must by fucking scary to put most of my money in 1 stock that will change a lot!

So, I ask, experienced people. What do you think?",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,315933,public,confidence,self,Should I put all in 1 stock? My algorithm,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/f6ig95/should_i_put_all_in_1_stock_my_algorithm/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been (mostly) a day trader for 7 months now, and even if it has profited me in the long run, no person should ever use Trading 212.

I’m just going to cut to the chase and show how the company truly doesn’t care about their customers and how the are a terrible, borderline a scam, service.

I have been screwed many times by the trading platform, but today it’s the reason why I have officially deleted the platform. 

I was doing rough stock price analysis over the last days and weeks of U.S. stocks ($SPCE, $MSFT, $PTON, etc.) and made an order for $SPCE right before market open (14:28 GMT). I made sure that I used less than 95% of my free funds as per terms and I definitely had enough funds to execute the buy order. 

14:30: Market opens, as predicted, $SPCE is up 10% in the first seconds of opening. I wait for my order to execute (even after the lost initial 60 seconds of market open) and then, out of fucking no where “the order was cancelled due to insufficient funds”. That is £1,200 profit down the fucking bin because Trading 212 didn’t want to execute the order (from initial £12,000). I have never in my 7 months of trading experience seen this, Trading 212 just cancelling your order because your in the profit by 10% in the first 120 seconds. You can look this up, $SPCE up fucking 22% , and I lost a 12% gain because of greedy fuckers at Trading 212.

Proof: https://imgur.com/a/yA2Rkdk

As of today, I am no longer using Trading 212, and I really hope you don’t either. They have been screwing me for long enough. I hope the outcome of this posts helps those who are getting into trading as well as those who have experience (although you wouldn’t be using Trading 212 if you were experienced), just go with an actual trading platform that respects you as a customer.

TL;DR: Doesn’t want you to actually profit, so they randomly close orders that can benefit the customer, providing zero reason as to why and hide behind small print to steal your money.

Sales are strong, the insulation technology for industrial piping (typically hot bitumen, oil, casing gas, make-up water etc) is very well adopted in industry, and $ASPN by all accounts is a sleeping giant (*opinion only*) based on the run up I have seen this year.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just announced a secondary offering @ 1,700,000 shares with the option for the underwriter to purchase an additional 225,000 shares. Oddly enough, this happened 1 week before earnings.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see a coincidence here. I figure the plan is to release a rockin&amp;#39; earnings report and then ease out a controlled dilution into potential new stockholders. Again, just my speculation.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking for someone better at Stonks than me, that could potentially enlighten me as to the effects of a +/- 7% share dilution. I have no idea what this equates to in terms of share price other than to look at earnings per share.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My reasoning is, I would love to buy the fuck out of this thing. But as always, when I see my potential entry point of 2.55$ in 2019, I really struggle justifying 9$ a share.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offering price is @ 8.25$, current price is 9.13$.

So, to start I'll provide a little context to my current role in work, given it's not something that requires easy efforts blah blah blah - I work for Amazon, I do Amazon stuff (Production Planning), and it requires a lot of data analyzing and trend identifying. Recently, I've started putting all extra money (maybe starting to grow up at 24 finally, who knows) into not-so-stupid shit and started allocating downtime to learning more about stocks.

I've been on Robinhood for about 6 months, started out suuuuper nooby. Didn't research a thing, just tried to ""go with the flow"" so to speak. Well, I didn't lose anything, but I also only put in like 380 dollars. I traded this way from October 5th 2019, to February 5th, 2020 where I closed at 412$.

And so I found options.

Well, February 6th I bought a put on BBY to dibble dabble with options. I closed that day at 452$ (9% gain in 1 day versus the measly 6.4% over 5 months). I was pretty much hooked day 1, admittedly. Since then, I've bought at least 1 contract each day and have dedicated a significant portion of my mornings studying the pre-market activities. I closed at 749$today. So that's 81.7% gain in the past 8 trading days. So far (And I know with time as a factor the inevitable will occur) I have been green every day. Probably just shit on my own luck there but whatever, I have the faith in some of y'all to tell me otherwise fingers crossed. 

I do my research avidly, if not aggressively, and I am really enjoying the idea of this kind of positive return, because it actually makes me happy (Saving toward goal of 20k down on a Tesla). I fortunately am granted RSU's through work, so each 6 months I get a nice chunk of change to play with, so the next vest I will likely allot a decent portion toward my portfolio to start throwing more money towards the options game. 

I'd really like to learn more about the strategies some people use, if there are groups out there that strategize together, or even just places for quick reads on becoming more fluent with the nature of the market. 

Appreciate anyone taking time to read, cheers.

📷 

We know that index funds have averaged a solid and consistent return over the years. In most cases beating the production of investment managers.

Warren Buffet said if you put $10,000 in an index fund on March 11, 1942, that’d be worth approximately $51,000,000 today.

That is through:

* 2 world wars
* the cuban missile crisis
* 9/11
* 14 presidents (7 democrats and 7 republicans)
* presidential assassinations and attempts
* other worldwide natural crisis

None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': ""I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don’t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.\n\nChina today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).\n\nChinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&amp;name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that’s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.\n\nIn December 2019, a Moody’s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China’s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.\n\nThis was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering “high yield products” to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, “because the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.” This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.\n\nThis is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron’s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:\n\n&gt;One area, in particular, is back at the forefront—local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities—China’s top two schools—found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.\n\n&gt;Put another way, 85% of China’s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.\n\n[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China’s exposure to the world economy. I’m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:\n\n&gt;In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China’s] total GDP growth.\n\n&gt;In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.\n\nWhile 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&amp;P 500’s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&amp;P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don’t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon’s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.\n\nAll of this comes on top of Boeing’s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China’s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. \n\nIn addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.\n\nTo summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing’s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.\n\nTL;DR: China’s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing’s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I’m not saying we’re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.\n\nTL;DR 2: Puts on semiconductors and Apple"", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/""&gt;other reddit threads&lt;/a&gt;, so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don’t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html""&gt;labor shortages&lt;/a&gt;), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;China today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html""&gt;here are some graphs that show just how different&lt;/a&gt;. Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to &lt;a href=""https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do &lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374""&gt;$33 billion in damage to the world economy&lt;/a&gt;, coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for &lt;a href=""https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts""&gt;one-third of global GDP growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, &lt;a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=medium""&gt;going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now&lt;/a&gt;. Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html""&gt;March or April&lt;/a&gt;. SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can&amp;#39;t make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g""&gt;according to the NYT&lt;/a&gt; are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that’s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In December 2019, a Moody’s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html""&gt;biggest threat to the global economy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM""&gt;4.9% of China’s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been &lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5""&gt;encouraged&lt;/a&gt; to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in &lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors""&gt;20 years&lt;/a&gt; last year. Then they proceeded to take over &lt;a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html""&gt;two more&lt;/a&gt;. This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was an economy &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html""&gt;in trouble&lt;/a&gt; before the coronavirus hit. The &lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking""&gt;shadow banking system&lt;/a&gt; appears to have gotten out of control. &lt;a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc""&gt;Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019&lt;/a&gt;. According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering “high yield products” to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, “because the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.” This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won&amp;#39;t kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. &lt;a href=""https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1""&gt;An article from Barron’s&lt;/a&gt; has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One area, in particular, is back at the forefront—local debt.

It seems the Corona virus doesn't interest anyone in the markets - sublime to me, but that's the situation friends
It's kind of a bubble, ignoring the economic realities and implications that this thing has on the market - every day that goes by, without eradicating the virus, and returning to a proper life trajectory, creating a real financial harm to companies - no flights, closed factories, hotels and tourism, transportation, a large chain of casualties , It's not a toddler thing.

But right now, it seems like everything is passing and going, and soon behind us according to market behavior
So who is right and who is wrong, the virus, the Chinese or the investors?

just before those who haven't seen or read the previous post: 2020  Recession Or Records In The Markets ?    - I recommend reading because there are a number of essential things that are very relevant to this review Markets

I want to show you something interesting about the Fang Index and the Nasdaq Index

according to Goldman's David Kostin
""modest S &amp; P500 earnings growth in Q4 was set to finally end a 4-quarter streak of negative EPS growth, with S&amp;P earnings per share set to rise by a modest 2% Y / Y, virtually all of the earnings upside came from just the top 5 biggest companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google (aka FAAMG), which collectively saw their EPS rise by a whopping 16% (mostly on the back of record stock buybacks which reduced the number of shares outstanding thus lowering the denominator in the EPS calculation). Without them, S&amp;P earnings were flat""

 NYFANG index  will show a future twin coming to Nasdaq, it is very interesting that there is a correlation with the price targets in terms of percentage
You can see in the index the triangle pattern and the break up - a target of 4070 area of ​​8-9% order

Global smart speaker sales hit a record high last year with shipments of 146.9 million units, up 70% over 2018, according to a recent report on the state of the smart speaker market from Strategy Analytics. Though Amazon still leads in the U.S. by a wide margin, its portion of the worldwide market is now declining as Chinese vendors gain traction.

However, Amazon’s Echo brand continues to lead smart speaker sales worldwide with a 26.2% share in 2019. But that’s a drop from Amazon’s 33.7% share in 2018. Amazon’s decline wasn’t Google’s gain, either, in terms of market share.
