The stock market rose today, with the Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500, and Russell 2000 setting new records in the shortened, post-Thanksgiving trading day. The Dow lagged behind a bit but is the best performing index this month. Optimism that an effective coronavirus vaccine could roll out relatively soon is counterbalancing the surging infection rates, with health officials warning about holiday travel.

The positive vaccine news keep coming. After announcing their vaccine candidate was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) have filed for an emergency use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US. If approved, the vaccine could roll out their vaccine for health workers and the most vulnerable starting in December. Moderna (MRNA) also announced their vaccine candidate is 94.5% effective is expected to file for emergency use authorization very soon. 

The vaccine candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN) and the University of Oxford has come under harsh scrutiny since the company announced the results, prompting the company to initiate another global trial. Since the vaccine announcement, the stock is around 3.6% down. 

During Thanksgiving, the US reported more than 100,000 new cases of coronavirus, the 24th day in a row the number is above 100,000. These are shockingly high numbers given around 20 states did not report data yesterday because of the holiday. Dr. Fauci and other top health officials are repeatedly warning Americans to reconsider their Thanksgiving plans and not travel to prevent transmission spread. However, many did not heed the warning, with more than 7 million travelers in the week before Thanksgiving. 

**Highlights**

* UPS, which is playing a key role in the deliveries along with FedEx (FDX), said in a statement Tuesday it is preparing to produce 1,200 pounds of dry ice per hour in its facilities. “UPS Healthcare now can produce up to 1,200 lbs. of dry ice per hour in its U.S. facilities to support the storage and transportation of cold chain products, such as frozen vaccines, in accordance with manufacturer storage requirements. The increased production also allows UPS to make dry ice available for U.S. and Canadian hospitals, clinics and other points of care requiring dry ice to store vaccines locally,” the company said.
* The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) — the market’s so-called “fear gauge” — briefly dipped below 20 on Friday, its lowest level in 9 months. Market participants are optimistic for future growth.

Amazon has spent several months preparing for a Black Friday and holiday peak like no other.

Even so, it may still need to make some tweaks to its site in order to meter demand, analysts say.

For Amazon, the real challenge may not materialize until Dec. 15, when UPS and FedEx start to enforce holiday shipping deadlines, which could drive more shoppers to the e-commerce giant’s website.

Malkiel was excellent:

""It is, of course, possible that the full effect of the new information is not immediately obvious to market participants. Some participants may vastly underestimate the significance of the drug, but others may greatly overestimate it. Therefore markets could underreact or overreact to news. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an excellent example of how investor sentiment and the difficulty of predicting the extent and severity of the resulting economic disruption can intensify market volatility. But it is far from clear that systematic underreaction or overreaction to news presents an arbitrage opportunity promising traders extraordinary gains. It is this aspect of EMH that implies a second, and in my view the most fundamental, tenet of the hypothesis: In an efficient market, no arbitrage opportunities exist.

EMH does not imply that prices will always be “correct” or that all market participants are always rational. There is abundant evidence that many (perhaps even most) market participants are far from rational. But even if price setting was always determined by rational profit-maximizing investors, prices (which depend on imperfect forecasts) can never be “correct.” They are “wrong” all the time. EMH implies that we can never be sure whether they are too high or too low. And any profits attributable to judgments that are more accurate than the market consensus will not represent unexploited arbitrage possibilities.

In my view the most compelling evidence that our stock markets are extremely efficient is that they are extraordinarily hard to beat. If market prices were generally determined by irrational investors and if it were easy to identify predictable patterns in security returns or exploitable anomalies in security prices, then professional investment managers should be able to beat the market. There is abundant evidence that they do not. Direct tests of the actual returns earned by professionals, who are compensated with strong incentives to outperform, should represent the most compelling evidence of market efficiency.

A true market inefficiency ought to be an exploitable opportunity. If there’s nothing investors can exploit in a systematic way, then it’s very hard to say that information is not being properly incorporated into stock prices and that our stock markets are not remarkably efficient.""",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,571810,public,confidence,self,Interpreting the stock market's strange behavior around the time of the onset of the coronavirus | A debate between Nobel Prize-winner Robert Shiller and Princeton professor Burton Malkiel,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/k25taj/interpreting_the_stock_markets_strange_behavior/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are two profitable tele-health companies that already exist. but need more capital to expand. They have a shareholder meeting coming up on December 8th to vote on these changes. The new entity will trade on the NYSE with ticker $UPH. Merger date I suspect will be in Q1 or Q2 2021.\n\nThe firm will be similar to Teladoc Inc ($Tdoc) which is currently trading at $190 as of today. However, they will be adding digital pharmacy similar to the one Amazon started offering in the past few weeks and also include service to outside of United States and Canada. As a physician who has been involved in startups, digital health, and similar projects,  ($GIX, $UPH) will definitely be worth over $100 in under 2 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2: Financials:**\n\n[Figure 1.$GIX \\($UPH\\) plans to capture a good share of business in digital pharmacy, tele-health, and behavioral health](https://preview.redd.it/2p85zmav6h161.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d6a5aa364dfdc9f3b1d6606519a8a74c09476c4)\n\n[Figure 2.

My entry price into $GIX warrants is 0.85 and plan to exit around $1.3-$1.5 which is very doable. The average price of a post LOI warrant is around $1.5 and this includes good and bad SPAC deals.

Let me know if my math or knowledge is incorrect.

Here is a scenario that I'm trying to figure out what would happen.

This is for the stock PIC and the warrant PIC-WS

Today on 11/26 at 9:36 EST I purchased one contract for the 1/15/21 15$ call for PIC at $2.95, at the time of the purchase the PIC-WS warrant was $3.89.

Some background on PIC.

1/16/21 they must merge

1 Warrant gives you the right to purchase 1 share of PIC at $11.50

If the average trade price of PIC is over 18$ for 20 days, they can purchase the warrants at 1 cent each (as far as I understand from their Q-10)

Now lets get the hypothetical scenario out here:

Let's say on 1-15-21 PIC closes at 18$. My option contract should be worth $3. So my profit would be 5$ total. 

Let's say instead of spending $295 on the 1 option contract, I instead bought 75 warrants at 3.89.

The warrants should be worth $6.50 so I would make a profit of $195.75

Do the warrants exercise on 1/16/21 then and if I have enough money in my account I would receive shares of PIC automatically, or do I just get the cash proceeds? 

Additionally, if the price of PIC is 18$ on 12/25 knowing that if it continues to trade above 18 for 20 days, the warrants basically are worthless.

In this article I will explain why this is a good investment through my own eyes. All the information I express is what I was able to gather from Airbnb’s submission to the SEC. The truth is I was waiting for this IPO for a long time, and it is surely the most important IPO of 2020. The IPO is going to take place in December without a clear date being published and will be listed as (NASDAQ:ABNB). I will be covering the following matters:
• Company’s Overview
• The impact of the coronavirus – Financials
• Competitors – WHAT DISTINGUISH Airbnb from them
• Risk factors to consider
• Safeguards to consider
Company’s overview
Airbnb is a vacation rental online business, that allows people worldwide to find places to stay either for travelling purposes, or business purposes. It is used for short-term stays meaning a temporary accommodation. It was founded in 2008 and has its headquarters in San Francisco, California, United States. It has more than 7 million homes listed, and it operates in 100,000 cities. Does Airbnb own the properties listed? No, it doesn’t own any of them, in fact people like you and me that have a residential home can list it on Airbnb after successfully complying with its rules. This helps the homeowners to achieve higher occupancy rates since it gives them “automatic advertising” when they appear on the searches without them having to spend money on advertising. Of course, Airbnb doesn’t do that for free! It charges them a 14 - 16% whereas in some other cases 20% to those who offer experiences and this fee is deducted from the hosts payout. This fee can vary from country to country. 
Impressive how such a “simple” idea – two friends renting their house to help them pay their rent, twelve years later turned into a business worth $18 billion. Before the coronavirus pandemic Airbnb was worth $38 billion.
Coronavirus pandemic impact on Airbnb - Financials
I believe that from now on the Covid-19 impact on any business is very important to be mention for a thoroughly comparison of what it used to be and what may be again. According to Airbnb’s reports, in 2019 there was an increase of 32% $4.8 billion in its revenue and a 29% increase in the bookings to $29.4 billion. However, 2020 didn’t seem to be a good year considering the virus, revenues faced a decline of 32% to $2.5 billion and its bookings fell by 39% to $18 billion.
Needless to say, that the net losses from 2018 to 2019 have seen a huge rise from $17 million in 2018 to $674 million by the end of 2019. Pandemic widened these losses even more for 2020 accumulating at $697 million losses until September 2020. The total deficit was $2.1 billion as of September 30,2020.
These numbers are surely causing you to reconsider your investment in Airbnb so to spread your hopes up again Reuters estimates a valuation raise to $30 billion. Not to forget that Airbnb was valued $31 million in 2017 which is nothing to what it is valued now after the pandemic. In general, This IPO hopes to reverse this decline.
Competitors
Since Airbnb falls under the booking market, I need to highlight the many rivals it has since this is a small barrier business to entry.
1.Unlike Airbnb, Expedia group (EXPE) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) have both reported a steady earning report that shows operating profits increasing year by year.
2.HomeAway (AWAY) does not charge a fee for each booking like Airbnb does, and its only asking for an annually $350 to advertise the property. Meaning leaving the hosts with much more profits than Airbnb.
3. Trip Advisor (TRIP) which is a rival, reported a much smaller revenue compared to Airbnb accumulating $156 million in 2019.

What distinguish it from its competitors?
The company’s advantage over its competitors is surely visible for the following reasons:
1. Airbnb is 3 times bigger than Trip Advisor
Trip Advisor might be a competitor, but Airbnb has an advantage over it if you compare the sizes which means Airbnb does not have to worry about it, at least for now.
2. Airbnb has a rapid growth
Comparing the percentage changes, Airbnb has proved to be growing almost 10 times faster than Booking Holdings and 5 times fast than Expedia Group.
3. Airbnb is very liquid
The term liquidity means that a company holds available funds in the bank. According to Bloomberg it holds $2 billion cash in the bank which means it can help it overcome the losses and the negative events that bother their way.

Risk factors to consider:
Before the vaccine I would have definitely say third wave of Coronavirus, but after the vaccine news I am personally very positive that all this will be a history soon, but this is a different article.
1. The regulations for short-term rentals are becoming stricter.
Airbnb grew because of the non-existing regulations of short-term rentals, but after this rapidly growing business things became more apparent. There have been some incidences from hosts discriminating guests, blaming guests for damages, misleading them from the pictures, even some parties going on causing police engagement. But like Uber, Airbnb it’s just a technology platform connecting hosts with guests. Bottom line, it can be very difficult to come up with regulations in all cities and regions which give Airbnb space to breath.
2. The competition becomes bigger.
Other online booking services like, Booking Holdings (BNKG) that provides the same service. In addition, Expedia (EXPE) bought Home Away (AWAY) few years ago and raised competition. Likewise, a French hospitality Accor bought short-term rental One Fine Stay and Marriot International (MAR) partnered with home rental platform Hostmaker to provide short-term rentals. As it seems Airbnb changed the game for hotels and pushed them to pursue other strategies which points how strong of a player is.
3. Airbnb does not have a clear path of profitability.
In fact, Airbnb has not ever generated profit, and this is something big to consider. All this together seem to shadow Airbnb’s future. But, with the IPO going on, and the available cash in the bank there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel.
Safeguards to consider:
1. The hotel sector has proved to be far more “destroyed” from Covid-19 than Airbnb which keeps it in a strong IPO position. Did you know that as of December 31, 2019 72% of 327 million Airbnb nights were booked by individual hosts? In other words, 92 million nights were listed under professional hosts by Airbnb. Moreover, Marriot International had 1.38 million rooms meaning almost 67 nights of full occupancy. Would these guests stayed there and keep Marriott’s properties full if it wasn’t for Airbnb? I don’t think so.
2. Recently, Bill Gates expressed his opinion on how the business travel will drop 50%. This can be very bad for hotels, but what about Airbnb? Because of the way everyone travels today, using online bookings and seeking to pay less for the maximum luxury, it makes it harder for hotels to beat the industry and especially Airbnb.
My Opinion
Investors need to consider all possible factors to form their decision. There is not a final price for the stock going IPO. At the end of the day is all a belief and since people will “value” it on the market I believe they will give it quite a high value at least in the long term. It is on my personal portfolio list, since the world is on track for a coronavirus free world.

The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n[Company's Footprint](https://preview.redd.it/hc09mm676r161.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcd7d11a2681c0cc6d44c7a0f79996caf32b8a1)\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company’s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally.

Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n\n[Strong Financials](https://preview.redd.it/5bvco38b6r161.png?width=2676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b300e2cab1456089b024f5cfd61c6f598d80d7f)\n\n* Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n\n[Current and Future Potential](https://preview.redd.it/jwg00s6d6r161.png?width=2704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e3dcfdd8f3fea45a494e49e9bb81d55857287a)\n\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\n**// About APXT**\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn’t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs, Served on 20 boards and advisory boards and saw mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Ebay,, Dell, Yahoo! and Twilio\n* Apex’s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners.

ASMB — seems to be in a buy zone under $6. Up this morning. Would you pull the trigger? 

MRKR — cheap, under $2. Well off the year high, and up slightly from the year low. Last earnings report was weak, and yet a strong-buy recommendation from two analysts. Is this a potential home run? 

MGEN — a bit pricy at $16.50. Strong buy recommendation from Thompson Reuters analysts. Cash runway through 2023. Recently completed a reverse stock split 1-15. A microRNA (miRNA) play. The big COVID-19 winners are mRNA, obviously. Are the process, pathways and potential similar?

### Market Notes:

Futures are drifting sideways, near flat at writing. The **VIX** is dropping lower, closing in on its lowest point since the pandemic began.

Markets are bullish on all accounts right now as the Presidential transition has entered into a peaceful phase.

Speculation is running wild in the markets. We saw it earlier in the week with the low floats, green energy, and electric vehicle plays. Today is no different. SPACs are the hot topic of the day. Some with connections to hot industries, some with very low floats.

SPAC stands for Special Purpose Acquisition Company. It's a different way to take a company public. The SPAC sells shares in a traditional IPO without any underlying business. It then uses that money to merge with an existing business. Once the deal closes the newly formed company gets a new ticker and trades like any other stock. **SPCE**, **NKLA**, &amp; **DKNG** all used SPACs to go public in the past year or so.

Today is a half-day of trading, markets close at 1 PM eastern. Historically this is a bullish day.

I'm looking for ways to contact agency's that can make use of the information I have recorded of a couple incidents concerning a daytime flying saucer in a major city. It appeared near the international airport as well as raytheon, and general dynamics Canada.

It looked like a bronze and silver courogated lampshade with a glowing gold or yellow cone on the top. It did't reflect sunlight and had no lights, it was a solid object that popped in did some insane CNC looking manoeuvres without acceleration or deceleration at a steady constant speed. Stopped on a dime then faded away. The whole event took about 3 seconds. This happened in the middle of a large city near an international airport, Raytheon, and general dynamics Canada.

I hope this story can reach the right person so that I can answer some questions of my own one day. if anyone can help me pass this story on to someone that might be that kind of person I would greatly appreciate it.

I documented some files of the incident that took place in 2008 in Calgary, AB, Canada. I live in Canada, However I'm unaware of a Canadian equivalent to the UAPTF. The UAPTF is a very recent program, that is why I have decided to post this now.

The Folder Contains

* 2 audio files About an hour each of interviews to be sure I recorded the story of the incident(s). The Incidents are described in great detail, as well as the event that acted as a catalyst for the incidents to occur.

* A brief Note recording the exact coordinates angle and approximate size of the object. date and times.

* Several map pins illustrating the location and distance of the witness to the craft in the first event and the vehicle in the second event. The location of the Raytheon and General Dynamics Canada facilitys Directly below where the craft appeared. The heliport location that the Chopper from the 2nd incident has taken off from and returned to (most likely could be verified by someone with the clearance)

* Historic records of the weather to support the date and times of the incidents.

* an illustration of the craft

* 1 photo and 1 blueprint style illustration to detail the chopper to distinctly identify the vehicle in the second event.

My main goal is to gain more insight into what occurred, and learn more. I have the overwhelming sense that I may never achieve this goal.

My personal feelings are of crushing disappointment at my own failure and inability learn more about this situation or others like it. My apologies in advance for wasting anyone's time here, that is not my intent.

Thank you for Reading this, as well as for your time and consideration.

Hey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. 

As my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)

So i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.

So here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don’t make this a 2 hour read time.

I will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

The second holding is Apple, is there anybody that doesn’t know this company? They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don’t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

I know I didn’t get into in-depth stuff, technical analysis, fundamentals and more but I will continue go more in depth with this stocks as time goes on. 

So here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)

As you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. 

And finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don’t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.

Hey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. 

As my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)

So i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.

So here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don’t make this a 2 hour read time.

I will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

Zoom is the one company that I will be selling in the next couple of days.

I know this trend is here to stay, but I thing there are far better play in the stock market out there rather than Zoom at this price point.

I know I didn’t get into in-depth stuff, technical analysis, fundamentals and more but I will continue go more in depth with this stocks as time goes on. 

So here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)

As you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. 

And finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don’t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.

And this pattern only gets worse when talking about children below the age of 10: I have a 8 year old cousin whose trying to learn how to subtract online and none of it’s clicking. In public, all I see are children glued to screens. 

Although technically, generations today are smarter than those before, what real impact could the gap in learning and the loss of key values stemming from technological dependence have?


I assume if people aren’t making as much money, consumer stocks will devalue; but, if the other 30% of people who are relatively wiser take over health and tech sectors would those boom?

Burton Malkiel, author of *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*:

""EMH does not imply that prices will always be “correct” or that all market participants are always rational. There is abundant evidence that many (perhaps even most) market participants are far from rational. But even if price setting was always determined by rational profit-maximizing investors, prices (which depend on imperfect forecasts) can never be “correct.” They are “wrong” all the time. EMH implies that we can never be sure whether they are too high or too low. And any profits attributable to judgments that are more accurate than the market consensus will not represent unexploited arbitrage possibilities.

In my view the most compelling evidence that our stock markets are extremely efficient is that they are extraordinarily hard to beat. If market prices were generally determined by irrational investors and if it were easy to identify predictable patterns in security returns or exploitable anomalies in security prices, then professional investment managers should be able to beat the market. There is abundant evidence that they do not. Direct tests of the actual returns earned by professionals, who are compensated with strong incentives to outperform, should represent the most compelling evidence of market efficiency.

A true market inefficiency ought to be an exploitable opportunity. If there’s nothing investors can exploit in a systematic way, then it’s very hard to say that information is not being properly incorporated into stock prices and that our stock markets are not remarkably efficient.""",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,570771,public,confidence,self,"Princeton's Burt Malkiel: ""The most compelling evidence that our stock markets are extremely efficient is that they are hard to beat.

I’m relatively new to stocks. I put some money in Air Canada a couple months ago and got a decent return. However, I’m think I want to invest more long term. I’ve read a little bit about indexes as well. Right now, I’m looking at these specific stocks:

AQN
ATZ

However, I’m waiting for them to drop slightly as I feel these past 2 weeks have been pretty high. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice? So far, I’m only sticking to stocks in CAD since the exchange rate and stuff (I’m Canadian). Should I also look at USD stocks? Any other stocks I should consider?

Traders bought and sold an average of nearly $26 billion of Tesla shares per session over the five days ending on Tuesday, accounting for almost 8% of all stock traded on U.S. exchanges, according to Refinitiv data. That is more than the combined value of trades in Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc over the same period.

Over the past year, Tesla has averaged over $16 billion a day in trades, followed by Apple, at about $14 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Including NIO, trading of stocks in the nascent electric vehicle industry reached an average of $38 billion a day in the past five sessions, accounting for 12% of all trading on U.S. exchanges.

After hitting record levels in the Dow and the S&amp;P, the market consolidated its gain, finishing the day even or slightly red. Ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday, optimism over a relatively quick rollout of a coronavirus vaccine propelled the Dow Jones to above 30,000 points for the first time and the S&amp;P to record highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been beaten down recently as market participants rotate to cyclical and reopening stocks also posted a strong week.

Countering the optimism is the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has been surging the last few weeks, raising the specter of further restrictions. As of Tuesday, there 88,080 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus pandemic

Finally, after four painful weeks, the surge in coronavirus infections are showing early signs of improvement. The national weekly average for daily new infections is 172,118, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that is an all-time record, it only represents an 11% increase to last week. In the past four weeks, average daily new infections were posting a roughly 30-40% increase every week. The daily average deaths are more than 1,500, similar level to early May.

Today was a slow day, in terms of news. With Thanksgiving coming up, markets are closed tomorrow and open only half-day Friday

The political uncertainty in the United States is beginning to clear up. Weeks after Joe Biden was declared President-Elect, General Service Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy acknowledged Biden’s win and approved the official transition process. The GSA is a government agency that works largely behind the scenes to support other federal entities, with responsibility for managing federal office space, procuring supplies and improving the use of technology across the government. The GSA provides a presidential transition team with Washington office space and coordinates access to federal agencies to plan potential policy changes with current administration officials, using $6.3 million allocated to support its efforts. This will finally allow Biden’s team to gain access to crucial information needed to effectively govern the nation. Mark Haefele, UBS Global chief investment officer, said, “We believe that the recent reduction in political uncertainty in the U.S., though far from complete, is another supportive factor behind the recent stock rally,

Markets were also encouraged by Biden’s appointment of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to Treasury  Secretary. Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014-2018, helping steer the historic bull market that followed the 2008 recession.

Jumia NYSE: JMIA 

I provided a full description if you care to read but, here is the Reddit analysis you care for. Think of Africa for a second. It’s not a country fyi, it’s a whole continent of people. A country that is developing so rapidly right now due to the boom of technology at our fingers. A country that every single big tech is trying to get into. Google literally flies wifi on top of Africa to provide wifi to the poorest regions. The people in the richest regions are so rich that they travel the whole world like maniacs. Think of the movie black panther showing the potential in African society. That utopia society is happening now. Africa is growing. So invest in African e-commerce. Invest in a company that is so overlooked. It’s growing now and it won’t stop soon. This is gonna be a 2 year hold guaranteed for me. I’m not taking this out of my portfolio to even avg down. JMIA to the moon baby. 

They got a market cap of 3 BILLION. This isn’t a small cap. 6 week rally of 400% so far and not slowing down. While everyone investing in China for EV, why aren’t you investing in the largest booming economy. Do you own DD and check out how much Africa is growing. Buy the rumour before it’s mainstream. E-commerce is the fastest growing economy and I know all of you already buy from Amazon Wayfair Etsy eBay shopify etc. I hope this brings some light to JMIA and if you aren’t investing atleast open up to African economy.

Google stock is the first stock I've ever bought but I recently trimmed half of my positions and holding onto the rest. I've been really disappointed by management team's decisions on their new product investing decisions because each failed product will also hurt their future product positioning. I still think they will perform OK in the long term with moderate %growth that aligns with general Ad revenue growth brought in by their existing core business like online search and Youtube. Their stock is priced fair and PE aligns with the average S&amp;P 500. I don't think it'll beat the market by a tremendous amount so I decided to take part of my risks elsewhere and moved capital to another company.

In comparison, Ford recalled 1.3 mil vehicles from 2014 to 2018 while selling 32.2 mil vehicles in the same time period. Fiat Chrysler also recalled 5.3 mil vehicles made between 2014 and 2018 while logging vehicle sales quantity of more than 400 mil over that period of time. Recall numbers as taken from [https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/](https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/). This means an average of about 1-4% recall per new vehicle sale.

HII is an example of the kind of stock that's overlooked by your average index-fund-trading herd investor. Passive investors just indexes and ETFs with general ideas of the companies in them, and then many set up automatic DCA so they're not even looking at the market when they make their buys. HII is the kind of company that gets deeply undervalued and overlooked due to the passive investing trends. Stocks like this can pay off well when they finally catch some notice. This is a big score for my elderly relative's fixed income portfolio as it can boost growth &amp; total return over the next few months while being safe diversification against more consumer retail and systemic economic risks of coronavirus.  

**My ADHD Snapshot**

* Huntington Ingalls (HII) is a shipbuilder in VA that builds subs   
* 🌈🐻: ""subs"" ≠ ""submissive""  
* landed $2.2B sub contract 2 days ago, this is a $6B company  
* subcontracting for General Dynamics contract for 22 of the new Columbia class subs  
* has a monopoly in the US aircraft carrier building  
* is in duopoly in submarines and destroyers  
* HII has a $46 billion, 10 year order backlog  
* stock buybacks &amp; dividend increases in its future for indefinite future   
* wins industry awards for good workplace, yada yada   
* sea power is an area of defense with active threats (fast-growing Chinese navy)  
* HII is still currently trading at about $170/$280 of its prepanndemic 52 week high  
* stock is so safe being 40-50% undervalued with huge margin of safety, wide moat    
* most quality dividend growth stocks are trading at the top-end of historical earnings multiples right now   
* HII is the kind of quality + dividend + value stock that investors are piling into right now plus it still has 40-50% rebound growth built in  

**Why is it still so low?**

* had poor Q2 earnings report due to COVID19 shutdown of its shipbuilding workplace operations &amp; has been ignored since that earnings report  
* such a nerdy, specialized area of industrials that it's still overlooked &amp; way undervalued this week   
* not in DJIA 30, not in a lot of indexes &amp; ETFs &amp; this is the kind of stock most passive investing retail investors never get exposed to or act on  
* dividend investors who wanted to go long on stocks that had built-in rebound growth first went for the quality large caps in the first week of November. For the past couple of months some investors have been bargain hunting among the multitude of small caps, and small cap funds have been doing really well. This company is a mid-cap and is probably the last group of quality dividend growth stocks to get attention from bargain hunters. 

**Why is this the time to buy?**

* Ex-dividend date is today, 11/25/2020  
* After the Dow Jones Industrial index topped an historic benchmark yesterday at 30K, industrial stocks are all taking a pause from its post-election run   
* $HII has dropped about 2% on it ex-dividend day (today) on the above 2 conditions

This is a dividend paying stock, and those usually drop after the date that the dividend ownership to quality for the current dividend closes. Dividend stocks usually drop on their ex-dividend dates and for a few days after, as anyone who is planning within a few days or weeks of the ex-dividend date usually waits until the ex-dividend date so that they can collect their dividend. If you're hunting for a dividend paying stock that has built-in rebound growth, on or just after the ex-dividend date is the automatic best time to buy, if you want a guaranteed improvement on performance of a few percent.

With people sending quality dividend stocks to high multiples &amp; buying up defense/war machine stocks, I'm buying this shipbuilder. Basically every fixed income person in the world who wants to catch some remaining rebound growth should want a piece of this mid cap stock while it's still under $200/share and calls under $200/share are dirt cheap today. All it would take are a couple of biz news articles that point out this overlooked stock, to moon this stock

Currently I'm 25 and I've been investing for about 2 years. I've seen some awesome growth (as most of us have this past year) and obviously, in the coming years im looking at purchasing a home/condo. With this goal in mind, is it wise to use my money that I've earned through my investments to do so? I hear things like, never take your money out of your investments, these are long terms holds and not short term solutions. I also hear that real estate is a great investment in and of itself so youre essentially moving your money from one investment to another.

My outlook is that I would much rather have my money in stocks as they will almost surely grow at a faster rate than they would in a savings account. I have an emergency fund covered but I dont see why I wouldn't throw a majority of my other cash, especially where I'm at now with minimal expenses, at stocks.

The poll is about to close out so I'll be doing the other stock reviews here soon based on the results, but anyways, Intel was one of the stocks requested in the comments by  [hhh888hhhh](https://www.reddit.com/user/hhh888hhhh/), so let's take a look.\n\nLet's start by taking a look at the business model.\n\n# INTC - Intel Corp:\n\nIt is one of the the world's largest and highest-valued semiconductor chip producers. Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system manufacturers, produces motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers, integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.\n\nIntel breaks itself down into the following segments:\n\n&gt;**- Client Computing Group**\xa0– produces hardware used in desktop and notebook computers  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- **Data Center Group**\xa0– produces hardware used in server, network, and storage platforms  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**- Internet of Things Group**\xa0– offers platforms designed for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings and home use  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- **Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group**\xa0– manufactures NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint, branded as Optane, products primarily used in solid-state drives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- **Intel Security Group**\xa0– produces software, particularly security, and antivirus software.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**- Programmable Solutions Group**\xa0– manufactures programmable semiconductors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The YoY growth of these segments can be found [here.](https://www.intc.com/segments)\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n&gt;\\-  Intel’s core business has broad exposure to growing market segments, particularly:  cloud, data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-  The company is successfully migrating from a PC-centric business to a data-centric business  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-  Intel stock is very cheap right now (P/E 8.9 November 2020), this could potentially lower the risk profile and boost rewards potential.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- They have been very strategic with their previous acquisitions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- As we will see when we look at the financials, their books up to the start of 2020 are solid.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n&gt;\\-   INTC is immersed in a semiconductor market that, while having stronger long-term growth potential, is highly cyclical. Big up years are followed by big down years. This is just the result of supply/demand cycles in the market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Intel is gradually losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), and other competitors. (NOTE: AMD &amp; NVIDIA will not be discussed here, this post is for INTC)\\*\\*\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Litigations. This is common for corporations this size. For intel it is mostly antitrust lawsuits.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Interesting note about AMD in the next section.\n\n# Financial History:\n\nSomething that was really interesting is, after going through a bit of Intel's 10K I got curious and checked out AMD as well. Right in the very beginning AMD has this as their disclaimer:\n\n&gt;***Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.\n\nThat really says a lot about the stength Intel Corp has in this market. Incase anyone is curious, [here is the source.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248817000043/amd-12312016x10k.htm#sC2A00DC72E841F4EC97A655066A6893F) Risk Factors, page 13.\n\nAnyways let's look into the financials over the last 10 years.\n\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|$53,999|$23,571|$10,800|0.5|\n|2013|$52,708|$20,323|$16,418|0.8|\n|2015|$55,355|$22,713|$25,511|1.05|\n|2017|$62,761|$26,179|$34,673|1.3|\n|2019|$71,965|$32,861|$33,285|1.0|\n\nThe revenue has increased an average of 3% YoY, the earnings has increase right along side this. Best has increased gradually, nearly x3 over the 10 years, but it is still only 1x the earnings. Very healthy, especially when we jump into this next section and talk about the cash flow.\n\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|20,960|10,764|15,370|\n|2015|19,020|7,326|21,168|\n|2019|33,145|16,213|17,697|\n\nCash flow from operations has increased about 5% YoY over the decade, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 5% as well. $33 Billion in cash flow is pretty crazy, especially considering they still have half of that left over after Capital Expenditures. They have been using the excess cash flow to pay down some debt (\\~750 Million in 2019), dividend out, and buy back shares. Over the decade the outstanding shares have decreased by 2% YoY from 5,256 to 4,417.\n\nWhat is crazy is that Intel is trading at about an 8x multiplier. Their P/E puts them in a nice range for this to be a very strong value play as well, especially considering they are already well established in a sector that is growing rapidly.\n\n# What are their plans for the future?\n\nIntel's intentions are to establish a lead in key technologies that are fundamentally changing computing and communications today and for tomorrow.\n\nTheir priority areas for continued growth:\n\n* Cloud Services\n* IoT (Internet of Things)\n* Artificial Intelligence\n   * Intel is acquiring SigOpt to Scale AI Productivity (October 2020)\n* 5G\n* Intelligent Edge\n* Autonomous Driving Technology\n\nHow they intend to deploy their capital:\n\n* Investing into R&amp;D to strengthen their competitive position.\n* Strategically invest/acquire companies to stimulate data-centric growth.\n* Return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\n\n# Current Dividend History:\n\nIntel Corp has only had 6 years of Continuous Dividend Growth at this time.\n\nNOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.\n\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$1.32|\n|:-|:-|\n|Yield|2.81% (Based on  $47.01 Price Nov 2020)|\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|\\-|\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|7%|\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.6%|\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|24.26%|\n\nFrom a dividend growth standpoint, the payout is very low, however their growth is extremely promising given the low payout of only 24.26%, and the fact that this company produces gobs of free cash flow.\n\nLet's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 7% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)\n\n|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Payout|$1.41|$1.51|$1.61|$1.73|$1.85|\n\n# Closing Thoughts:\n\nAt its current price, with the strong financials, and overall excellent business growth prospects, this stock would best be considered a really strong value play. The dividend is there and there is very strong potential for growth, however the payout is still a bit low. Now for a very long term hold, this could be an excellent entrance price, especially if they were to start increasing the dividend growth rate as they increased their cash flow.\n\nI hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. There are always more risks that need to be considered, additionally it is always smart to **read opposing views, don't just read what will validate what you want to believe about a stock.**\n\nThe poll ([It can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/jxs9uy/which_of_the_following_would_you_like_to_see_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) will be closing out soon, so the 2nd place and last place will have their reviews written as time allows. There were some requesting a review for Realty Income (O), it will be done likely after the other 2 or whenever, evaluating REITs is a bit of a different process due to their required 90% payouts.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!"", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good morning/evening everyone.

Very healthy, especially when we jump into this next section and talk about the cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Cash Flow from Operations&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Capital Expenditures&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;FCF/E Ratio&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2011&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;20,960&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10,764&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;15,370&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2015&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;19,020&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7,326&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;21,168&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2019&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;33,145&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,213&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;17,697&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cash flow from operations has increased about 5% YoY over the decade, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 5% as well. $33 Billion in cash flow is pretty crazy, especially considering they still have half of that left over after Capital Expenditures. They have been using the excess cash flow to pay down some debt (~750 Million in 2019), dividend out, and buy back shares. Over the decade the outstanding shares have decreased by 2% YoY from 5,256 to 4,417.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is crazy is that Intel is trading at about an 8x multiplier.

The dividend is there and there is very strong potential for growth, however the payout is still a bit low. Now for a very long term hold, this could be an excellent entrance price, especially if they were to start increasing the dividend growth rate as they increased their cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

rounding top should take us to 366-367 resistance but we are in a bear wedge so she could break support at any time.

However, this momentum cannot last unless we receive a surprise FDA approval Wednesday or Friday (doubtful IMO). \n\nSPY broke 363.34 resistance and will try to hold that as new support as she edges towards the major bear flag 366-367 ish resistance. If SPY hits that and bounces, we could see a triple top and downward movement. IF she plows through, like she's been doing, we will be edging closer to the w-shaped recovery pattern from early predictions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyjcg6ypod161.png?width=2188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fe4abd5f967c01c64febe265f936692e82dce81\n\nSPY broke out of the word three rounding top patterns yesterday. I was wrong about the bounce from 351 ish but it's interesting nonetheless. Lets see if she creates another rounding top today - to make it even more interesting. \n\nHere's the excerpt from 11/21: “This isn't a pattern seen in textbooks, but I thought I'd share my biased view. After a breakout of the first rounding top, SPY fell -0.72% and then recovered to 358. SPY formed another rounding top (ish) pattern from the 11/17 - 11/19 before dropping -1.07%. Again she started a rounding top from 11/19 - 11/20. SPY could drop down to 351.31 (ish) by Monday and Tuesday and quickly recover to 358 - 363 by Wednesday or Thursday.

However, this momentum cannot last unless we receive a surprise FDA approval Wednesday or Friday (doubtful IMO). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SPY broke 363.34 resistance and will try to hold that as new support as she edges towards the major bear flag 366-367 ish resistance. If SPY hits that and bounces, we could see a triple top and downward movement.

I was wrong about the bounce from 351 ish but it&amp;#39;s interesting nonetheless. Lets see if she creates another rounding top today - to make it even more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the excerpt from 11/21: “This isn&amp;#39;t a pattern seen in textbooks, but I thought I&amp;#39;d share my biased view. After a breakout of the first rounding top, SPY fell -0.72% and then recovered to 358. SPY formed another rounding top (ish) pattern from the 11/17 - 11/19 before dropping -1.07%. Again she started a rounding top from 11/19 - 11/20. SPY could drop down to 351.31 (ish) by Monday and Tuesday and quickly recover to 358 - 363 by Wednesday or Thursday.

### Market Notes:

The Dow and S&amp;P 500 both posted new record high closes yesterday. I think we are still in good position for a strong end of year rally. 

Markets were all up 1% or more. I believe the markets could take a breather today and pick-up momentum again Friday or next week. But overall the trend is you friend. Bears have been getting burned in this market.

EV and green energy plays are slowing down. I'm still bullish but will selective today.

They have also gone up because of good news on TSLA recently.

The EV bubble is about to pop - especially for NIO. NIO has already gone up almost 30x this year.  
It is no longer being promoted, people are switching to promoting the new ticker PLTR.

It is also not going up with TSLA - Usually it will either go up the same amount as TSLA or more, but now, it is flat when TSLA goes up and really red when TSLA goes red.

This means that the momentum behind hot EV stocks like NIO is dying and the price might come crashing down soon.

Summary\n\n1. Novavax (NVAX) is slightly behind Pfizer/Moderna/AZN/JnJ in the COVID vaccine race but will likely end up with the **most effective vaccine** with the **fewest side effects** and will be the **easiest to distribute,** as if only requires standard refrigeration (4 degrees Celsius).\n2. Many people think that the \\~95% efficacy data from PFE/MRNA means that we're in the clear, but the data refers to 95% prevention of **symptomatic disease and not 95% prevention of infection**, which is an important difference that has been largely overlooked. **Based on pre-clinical and Phase 1 clinical data, I think NVAX will be significantly better at not only preventing symptomatic disease, but also better at preventing infection and transmission.**\n3. Importantly, NVAX's COVID vaccine (NVX-CoV2327) is the **only candidate that can be multiplexed with a flu vaccine resulting in a long-term revenue stream beyond the initial wave of vaccinations** providing a convenient option in the likely scenario that annual COVID boosters are recommended.\n4. The mixed results of yesterday's AZN interim update create a buying opportunity for NVAX, as AZN's vaccine candidate was a major competitor as the other low cost, easily distributed vaccine for most of the world. Another near term catalyst within the next 1-2 weeks is an interim update from the Phase 3 UK trial that began in September. Buyout rumors are yet to be substantiated, but NVAX is an attractive acquisition candidate with a market cap of only $6B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My background:**\n\n* Scientist for 5+ years in vaccine R&amp;D at a major pharmaceutical company. Currently a biomedical PhD candidate at a top 5 program (whatever, nbd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** I've been in and out over the last couple of months but waited until yesterday to load up. Plan to also add shares.\n\n* Dec 18 '20 100c\n* Dec 18 '20 110c\n* Jan 15 '21 110c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bottom line:** I think $NVAX is being overlooked due to the recent wave of vaccine news but will end up being the clear vaccine of choice for most of the world and will significantly outgrow it's current $6B market cap. I think short-term catalysts (Phase 3 interim updates, potential buyout) will drive the price higher in the next couple of weeks and like the long-term outlook (global vaccine distribution, annual flu/COVID combo vaccine, potential buyout). **This stock has low float and one piece of positive news will send this back to at $120.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DISCUSSION (skip if you're not interested in the science)\n\n**Why I think $NVAX will produce the most effective vaccine and why this matters**\n\nOne of the most important correlates of protection used to estimate vaccine efficacy is the amount of antibodies the vaccine generates in the host, also referred to as **antibody titer** (high titer = high levels of antibody). **NVAX has reported significantly higher antibody titers than any of the other candidates in phase 3 trials: \\~6-fold higher than MRNA, \\~10.8-fold higher than PFE, and \\~10.5 fold higher than AZN** (see graph below; source: [RA capital](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_11062020_D.pdf?v=XM0HdrTJDriIT5wg2aGibyy_vnxZt0mIHMi3grCiQ0A)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmall differences in antibody titers shouldn't be overinterpreted, however large differences are more likely to be meaningful and correspond with measurable differences in real-world changes in immunity. **Based on the titer data reported to date, we would expect NVAX to have the highest efficacy.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Note the log scaled y-axis](https://preview.redd.it/qzig6e3de4161.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e50ae47c7ea372247e97cc22fa0176f3cf7497)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore convincing support for NVAX comes from primate challenge studies in which rhesus macaques were given vaccine or placebo and then exposed to the virus. **Monkeys vaccinated with NVX-CoV2327 had zero evidence of viral replication in either the upper or lower airway, whereas monkeys vaccinated with MRNA's vaccine (the most effective vaccine reported to date) had evidence of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways (see graphs below; top graph is NVAX, bottom graph is MRNA).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcsd30c6n4161.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c97bb3e889cd45a031a7fdb4841f717eaa2816ec\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sq47cz58n4161.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655951710581046b64d769dc3bfc581ce9da007e\n\n**Bear with me, but this data is significant for reasons that require a bit of explanation**. First, it's important to understand that protection in the upper airway (i.e. nose/throat) from COVID infection is more challenging to achieve than in the lower airway (i.e. the lungs) with intramuscular injected vaccines. This matters because a vaccine that only protects the lungs without also protecting the upper airway will likely prevent severe disease in the lungs but may not prevent viral infection ([reference](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20096693v1)). In other words, it might prevent a person from getting really sick but it won't prevent them from transmitting the disease to others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on Moderna's challenge data shown above, their vaccine seems to fit the profile of mostly preventing infection in the lungs combined with a lesser degree of protection in the upper airway (at least in rhesus macaques). Now, you might say who cares about a primate challenge study if we have real-world clinical trial data in humans that says the vaccine is 94.5% effective? The reason I care is because all of the interim numbers that have been reported to date refer to the **efficacy of preventing symptomatic cases only and not of preventing infection** ([source](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy)). This is a huge deal and is almost certainly not the way that the public has interpreted the headlines to date. (UPDATE: this exact point was addressed by Moderna's CMO this morning [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-chief-medical-officer-vaccines-interview-2020-11)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we assume that the non-human primate challenge data presented above is representative of what will happen in humans then I think the efficacy numbers that are being thrown for around for Moderna (and likely Pfizer/AZN) don't tell the full story and **I suspect that the sentiment about the efficacy of these vaccines will change over time**. Again, you might ask who cares - this level of efficacy still sounds really good and I completely agree that it's impressive for first generation vaccines made in under a year. These vaccines will be important for rapid immunization of high risk groups and I would gladly take one knowing everything I know now if I was high risk. However, I expect that this overlooked issue of **disease prevention versus infection prevention** for the PFE/MRNA/AZN vaccine candidates will start getting more air time. Even if it doesn't, the infection data (rather than just the symptomatic disease data) will eventually be released as a secondary endpoint for these trials at some point in the next couple of months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnlike Moderna's challenge study, **NVAX provided complete protection in both the upper and lower airway,** ***despite using a higher viral challenge dose***\\*\\*. This fits with the superior antibody titer data and leads me to believe that there is a high probability that NVAX will not only have a higher rate of reduction in symptomatic cases but may also provide sterilizing immunity in a large subset of patients, therefore not only preventing disease but also preventing transmission in a subset of patients\\*\\*. If the challenge data ends up translating in humans - and I think it will - then NVAX will end up having a significantly superior vaccine to the others currently in Phase 3 trials. The potential for NVX-CoV2327 to also prevent infection instead of only preventing symptomatic disease is a big deal and is why I think NVAX is going to become the vaccine of choice even though they are a bit behind their competitors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who cares if NVAX ends up with a more effective vaccine if the others will be available first?**\n\nNVAX will probably miss part of the first wave of vaccinations for front line workers and high risk individuals if the current timelines hold, but this is a small group of people. However, I anticipate we'll get an interim update from NVAX's Phase 3 UK trial in the next couple of weeks and for all the reasons outlined above, **it will be clear that NVAX has the best vaccine well BEFORE the majority of people have been vaccinated**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNVAX is targeting having 100M doses ready by the end of 2020 and will be producing hundreds of millions of doses per quarter beginning 1Q 2021, reaching an annual run rate of 1 billion doses per year by the end of 2021 ([source](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)). NVAX has an agreement in place from the UK to purchase 60M doses and an agreement with Canada to supply up to 76M doses. NVAX has an exclusive licensing agreement to produce 1B doses for India and other countries in the developing world and has a partnership with Takeda to produce 250M doses per year for Japan. **As a result, I anticipate that NVAX will also have the supply to be able to capture a significant portion of mass vaccination efforts.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I think there is a high probability that annual COVID booster shots will be recommended for most people for the foreseeable future and if so, NVAX stands to benefit the most.**\n\nDue to the novelty and severity of COVID-19, I think it's highly likely that periodic (if not annual) boosters of a COVID vaccine will be recommended for most people, especially those in high risk groups. There are several reasons that NVAX will be the primary beneficiary in this scenario - I'll begin by explaining why it's unlikely that the current crop of competitors will be suitable for this application:\n\n1. mRNA-based vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) are very painful and I suspect that people vaccinated with them on the first round will be hesitant to get in line and take them again once other more traditional options are available. They're also more expensive per dose and have additional cold chain/logistical challenges.\n2. Vector-based vaccines like AZN/JNJ cannot be re-administered due to vector-based immunity. Your immune system develops an response against the vector itself leading to limited efficacy in subsequent doses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNVX-CoV2327 on the other hand, has none of these downsides and is well suited for use in this context. Furthermore, NVX-CoV2327 has the potential to be multiplexed with a flu vaccine into a single shot which is an extremely attractive option. Flu vaccinations will probably become even more important in the future with COVID circulating and getting people to take one shot instead of two increases the probability of compliance. NVAX makes a flu shot (Nanoflu) that reached all primary endpoints in a Phase 3 trial and is being submitted for accelerated FDA approval. Nanoflu uses the same adjuvant as NVX-CoV2327 so the potential for being able to multiplex the two vaccines is high. **The bottom line is that NVAX has the potential for a significant stream of recurring revenue from COVID booster shots that PFE/MRNA/AZN do not have**. A multiplexed flu shot would be the icing on the cake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\n1. The market is underappreciating the the fact that interim vaccine data has shown 95% effectiveness of **preventing symptomatic disease and not 95% effectiveness of preventing infection** and therefore transmission. In my opinion, NVAX will be significantly better in this regard and be in high demand if/when this distinction is made.\n2. NVAX will not only be the most effective vaccine but will be the best COVID vaccine investment due to it's high total addressable market (favorable cost/distribution) and potential for recurring revenue, in conjunction with only a $6B market cap (Moderna has a $39B market cap).\n3. Interim update of Phase 3 UK data represents a significant near-term catalyst. Potential for acquisition cannot be ignored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably missed a few things but this has taken way too long and I need to go back to work. I will do my best to answer any questions.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Update #1:**\n\nA few people have commented about my use of December calls and how this doesn't align with the DD that I outlined. Here's my logic:\n\n1. The phase 3 trial in the UK began in September and the first interim update will be provided once a total of 66 cases have been observed. Based on the daily case load observed in the UK since September, the trial should hit the 66 case threshold very soon (1-2 weeks) and we'll be getting an update that I think will lead to a huge pop.\n2. With the subpar data from AZN released yesterday, one of the other low-cost/easily shipped vaccines looks like much less of a threat and I'm more comfortable holding December options while I wait for the interim update to happen.\n3. None of this takes away from how I feel about the long-term prospects; ideally I will profit from these December calls and then roll some of that forward and buy shares.\n\nIt's risky but it will pay off huge if we get an announcement in the next 2 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Update #2**:\n\nI mentioned that mRNA based vaccines are painful and that I think it won't play well with the public. Well here's an [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/covid-vaccine-cdc-should-warn-people-the-side-effects-from-shots-wont-be-walk-in-the-park-.html) I missed from CNBC talking about exactly that point with mRNA vaccines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ljke7zk009161.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e963e521ae5f9f767e97ff30f2cda8137e269de\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5we143n709161.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2850b2dc955b8f1e28cb1b53b7ea7dad69ee4fd0\n\nI think this is a needle-mover and isn't being talked about. The type of person to volunteer for a vaccine trial is very different than the subset of people in the country that are already reluctant to take a COVID vaccine, or any vaccine for that matter. Once we start vaccinating non-trial participants I think this is going to get more coverage and take some wind out of the sails of Pfizer and Moderna.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*"", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;$NVAX Summary&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Novavax (NVAX) is slightly behind Pfizer/Moderna/AZN/JnJ in the COVID vaccine race but will likely end up with the &lt;strong&gt;most effective vaccine&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;fewest side effects&lt;/strong&gt; and will be the &lt;strong&gt;easiest to distribute,&lt;/strong&gt; as if only requires standard refrigeration (4 degrees Celsius).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many people think that the ~95% efficacy data from PFE/MRNA means that we&amp;#39;re in the clear, but the data refers to 95% prevention of &lt;strong&gt;symptomatic disease and not 95% prevention of infection&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an important difference that has been largely overlooked. &lt;strong&gt;Based on pre-clinical and Phase 1 clinical data, I think NVAX will be significantly better at not only preventing symptomatic disease, but also better at preventing infection and transmission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Importantly, NVAX&amp;#39;s COVID vaccine (NVX-CoV2327) is the &lt;strong&gt;only candidate that can be multiplexed with a flu vaccine resulting in a long-term revenue stream beyond the initial wave of vaccinations&lt;/strong&gt; providing a convenient option in the likely scenario that annual COVID boosters are recommended.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The mixed results of yesterday&amp;#39;s AZN interim update create a buying opportunity for NVAX, as AZN&amp;#39;s vaccine candidate was a major competitor as the other low cost, easily distributed vaccine for most of the world.

The potential for NVX-CoV2327 to also prevent infection instead of only preventing symptomatic disease is a big deal and is why I think NVAX is going to become the vaccine of choice even though they are a bit behind their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who cares if NVAX ends up with a more effective vaccine if the others will be available first?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NVAX will probably miss part of the first wave of vaccinations for front line workers and high risk individuals if the current timelines hold, but this is a small group of people. However, I anticipate we&amp;#39;ll get an interim update from NVAX&amp;#39;s Phase 3 UK trial in the next couple of weeks and for all the reasons outlined above, &lt;strong&gt;it will be clear that NVAX has the best vaccine well BEFORE the majority of people have been vaccinated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NVAX is targeting having 100M doses ready by the end of 2020 and will be producing hundreds of millions of doses per quarter beginning 1Q 2021, reaching an annual run rate of 1 billion doses per year by the end of 2021 (&lt;a href=""https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf""&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). NVAX has an agreement in place from the UK to purchase 60M doses and an agreement with Canada to supply up to 76M doses. NVAX has an exclusive licensing agreement to produce 1B doses for India and other countries in the developing world and has a partnership with Takeda to produce 250M doses per year for Japan. &lt;strong&gt;As a result, I anticipate that NVAX will also have the supply to be able to capture a significant portion of mass vaccination efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think there is a high probability that annual COVID booster shots will be recommended for most people for the foreseeable future and if so, NVAX stands to benefit the most.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the novelty and severity of COVID-19, I think it&amp;#39;s highly likely that periodic (if not annual) boosters of a COVID vaccine will be recommended for most people, especially those in high risk groups. There are several reasons that NVAX will be the primary beneficiary in this scenario - I&amp;#39;ll begin by explaining why it&amp;#39;s unlikely that the current crop of competitors will be suitable for this application:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;mRNA-based vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) are very painful and I suspect that people vaccinated with them on the first round will be hesitant to get in line and take them again once other more traditional options are available. They&amp;#39;re also more expensive per dose and have additional cold chain/logistical challenges.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vector-based vaccines like AZN/JNJ cannot be re-administered due to vector-based immunity. Your immune system develops an response against the vector itself leading to limited efficacy in subsequent doses.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NVX-CoV2327 on the other hand, has none of these downsides and is well suited for use in this context. Furthermore, NVX-CoV2327 has the potential to be multiplexed with a flu vaccine into a single shot which is an extremely attractive option. Flu vaccinations will probably become even more important in the future with COVID circulating and getting people to take one shot instead of two increases the probability of compliance. NVAX makes a flu shot (Nanoflu) that reached all primary endpoints in a Phase 3 trial and is being submitted for accelerated FDA approval. Nanoflu uses the same adjuvant as NVX-CoV2327 so the potential for being able to multiplex the two vaccines is high. &lt;strong&gt;The bottom line is that NVAX has the potential for a significant stream of recurring revenue from COVID booster shots that PFE/MRNA/AZN do not have&lt;/strong&gt;. A multiplexed flu shot would be the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The market is underappreciating the the fact that interim vaccine data has shown 95% effectiveness of &lt;strong&gt;preventing symptomatic disease and not 95% effectiveness of preventing infection&lt;/strong&gt; and therefore transmission. In my opinion, NVAX will be significantly better in this regard and be in high demand if/when this distinction is made.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NVAX will not only be the most effective vaccine but will be the best COVID vaccine investment due to it&amp;#39;s high total addressable market (favorable cost/distribution) and potential for recurring revenue, in conjunction with only a $6B market cap (Moderna has a $39B market cap).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interim update of Phase 3 UK data represents a significant near-term catalyst. Potential for acquisition cannot be ignored.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably missed a few things but this has taken way too long and I need to go back to work. I will do my best to answer any questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;************************************************************************************&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update #1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few people have commented about my use of December calls and how this doesn&amp;#39;t align with the DD that I outlined. Here&amp;#39;s my logic:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The phase 3 trial in the UK began in September and the first interim update will be provided once a total of 66 cases have been observed. Based on the daily case load observed in the UK since September, the trial should hit the 66 case threshold very soon (1-2 weeks) and we&amp;#39;ll be getting an update that I think will lead to a huge pop.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With the subpar data from AZN released yesterday, one of the other low-cost/easily shipped vaccines looks like much less of a threat and I&amp;#39;m more comfortable holding December options while I wait for the interim update to happen.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;None of this takes away from how I feel about the long-term prospects; ideally I will profit from these December calls and then roll some of that forward and buy shares.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s risky but it will pay off huge if we get an announcement in the next 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update #2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that mRNA based vaccines are painful and that I think it won&amp;#39;t play well with the public. Well here&amp;#39;s an &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/covid-vaccine-cdc-should-warn-people-the-side-effects-from-shots-wont-be-walk-in-the-park-.html""&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; I missed from CNBC talking about exactly that point with mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ljke7zk009161.png?width=756&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1e963e521ae5f9f767e97ff30f2cda8137e269de""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ljke7zk009161.png?width=756&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1e963e521ae5f9f767e97ff30f2cda8137e269de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/5we143n709161.png?width=766&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2850b2dc955b8f1e28cb1b53b7ea7dad69ee4fd0""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5we143n709161.png?width=766&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2850b2dc955b8f1e28cb1b53b7ea7dad69ee4fd0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this is a needle-mover and isn&amp;#39;t being talked about. The type of person to volunteer for a vaccine trial is very different than the subset of people in the country that are already reluctant to take a COVID vaccine, or any vaccine for that matter. Once we start vaccinating non-trial participants I think this is going to get more coverage and take some wind out of the sails of Pfizer and Moderna.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;************************************************************************************&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'wallstreetbets', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2th52', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/wallstreetbets', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1611561, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'thumbnail': 'https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/lpE_pXjV-m09vUH6ofEoAdEjrdZLwpWu19_3GWWjudE.jpg', 'thumbnail_height': 14, 'thumbnail_width': 140, 'title': 'DD from an actual scientist: $NVAX might not be first, but will produce the most effective and easily distributed COVID vaccine that will end up as the vaccine of choice', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 1, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 392, 'upvote_ratio': 0.96, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'wls': 0}]",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/,14.0,140.0,,,,,,,,

Stocks rallied today with market participants optimistic that an effective coronavirus vaccine can be deployed in the near term. The Dow Jones hit 30,000 points for the first time ever, extending a crazy rally of more than 10% in November. In spite the good news, the surge in coronavirus cases continues in the US.

The Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 1.53% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.41% up and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.61%. Overall a great day for the market.

Expectations for relatively quick distribution of the vaccine has analysts upgrading their growth prospects for 2021. A fully inoculated public would bring back beaten-down industries, like travel and cruise lines, that were devastated by social distancing guidelines. As a result, market participants have rotated out of stay-at-home stocks like Zoom (ZM) and Peleton and into reopening and cyclical stocks. 

The political uncertainty in the United States is beginning to clear up. Weeks after Joe Biden was declared President-Elect, General Service Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy acknowledged Biden’s win and approved the official transition process. The GSA is a government agency that works largely behind the scenes to support other federal entities, with responsibility for managing federal office space, procuring supplies and improving the use of technology across the government. The GSA provides a presidential transition team with Washington office space and coordinates access to federal agencies to plan potential policy changes with current administration officials, using $6.3 million allocated to support its efforts. This will finally allow Biden’s team to gain access to crucial information needed to effectively govern the nation. Mark Haefele, UBS Global chief investment officer, said, “We believe that the recent reduction in political uncertainty in the U.S., though far from complete, is another supportive factor behind the recent stock rally,

Markets were also encouraged by Biden’s appointment of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to Treasury  Secretary. Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014-2018, helping steer the historic bull market that followed the 2008 recession.

Finally, after four painful weeks, the surge in coronavirus infections are showing early signs of improvement. The national weekly average for daily new infections is 172,118, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that is an all-time record, it only represents an 11% increase to last week. In the past four weeks, average daily new infections were posting a roughly 30-40% increase every week. The daily average deaths are more than 1,500, similar level to early May.

Or the most it has moved in a single day?

The backstory is that I have been quick to cash out in the past on earnings and sold at the smallest blip. If I had stayed in longer on a couple speculative stocks I could have made a down payment on another house. Hindsight is 2020. I am new to trailing stop losses but these seem like the right instrument for this scenario.  I don’t have time to look at my speculative portfolio every hour. Again, these are speculative low value stocks, which I am already up on a significant amount for the year. which could have even more upside. But the speculation could run out quickly and decide to take a huge dive back to reality at any given time. As with everyone, I want to lock in as much of my gains as possible if they come crashing back to reality, but also I don’t want to get out too early.

I understand a stop loss order but I don’t have time to keep going in and readjusting that every day. Hence my thoughts on learning more about trailing stop loss percentage orders. The question is how much to set that percentage to not be triggered by everyday swings and still allow it to grow. It seems that is the million dollar question for most people.

My questions are:

\-is there an easy way to get average daily movement on a percentage numbers for a past given timeframe? Yeah I could go do the math myself and look at the open and close for every given day for the last 6 months but that would be tedious.

\-if that tool exists then it must also be able to tell me the most it moved during a day for the same timeframe?

Assuming those tools exist to easily figure out that information, are there generally accepted strategies based on those numbers?

In addition, I've looked at a novel way of generating sentiment based on author’s credibility, calculated on accuracy of his/her past messages. The results provide empirical evidence that, using this method (3 and 5 scale index models), there is strong and useful information on financial message boards pertinent to stock market movements. In addition, it demonstrates that investors can use this information in order to make accurate predictions about the return on investment and to implement good trading strategies based on sentiment analysis, doing, on average, much better than traditional investment strategies like Buy and Hold or Moving Averages (5 -20 periods).

Few days back i posted this topic and although i got (expectedly so) quite a bit of hate, muckery and insults, i would still like to continue on this route in hopes that i will save some unlucky retail of their hard earned money, once this fraud is exposed and followed by collapse of the price, exchange insolvencies etc.:[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jylc71/bernie\_madoff\_and\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jylc71/bernie_madoff_and_bitcoin/)

Yesterday, Amy Castro posted interesting article on the very same topic. Amy describes herself as following: ""I am an independent reporter, focused on cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology and financial fraud. ""

Anyone who considers jumping into this speculative asset, please take 5 minutes to go through the points Amy points out. Even if you are a strong supporter of this asset class, it does not hurt you to take some time, to see some counterarguments, even if only for the sake of discussion. You never know, it might save you a fortune somewhere down the road.

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

---

#**[1-Year CAGR](https://i.imgur.com/SeGsfvM.png)**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Analyst Coverage](https://i.imgur.com/w4nIIR3.png)**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat. General Motors has a signifigant amount of Hold ratings due to their volatile past and overall historical decline which they are just now compensating for with a break into the EV market. This is likely to shift bullish in the future as the stock has seen growth as of late. The Chinese stocks are lacking in coverage as they are just now getting the attention of investors internationally, however they all have a significant amount of buy ratings and their coverage is far more positive than their American counterparts on a % of ratings basis. For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM. 

1. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
2. Li Auto ($LI)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[YTD Performance](https://i.imgur.com/997gUV2.png)**

These companies are the hottest investments on the market right now, flat out crushing the indices and reaping in rewards for investors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a huge factor in these companies and the idea that each of them can be the next industry leader. So far we are seeing each company get an equal share of the hype - driven up or down by their ability to meet the obligations of the market. (ie,. crushing earnings and meeting demand for delivery). NIO has ran laps around the rest of its peers as it was the first to receive such attention and came from the lowest of prices, having plunged to $2 a share in what feels like centuries ago. General Motors has moved the weakest as it is a value play that has been in the game for decades and has other segments it relies upon for growth. Xpeng's massive 40% move today pushed it above Li Auto and has it catching up to Tesla. Whether or not that happens, only time will tell.

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. General Motors ($GM)

#**[Short Float](https://i.imgur.com/yTmoymh.png)**

This sector has enough of the market betting against it to make any value investor go pale. However it has not stopped the companies at all, and the bears have been ripped to shreds as seen in the YTD performance. Li Auto has the highest short float at 15% as it is the youngest and smallest of the Chinese EV trio and is still relatively new. Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&amp;P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the ""old boys club"" of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often. 

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Nio Inc ($NIO)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
5. Li Auto ($LI)

---

#**[Margins](https://i.imgur.com/mSIapfl.png)**

Margins are one of the best ways to value a company's operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. 

With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago. 

1. Tesla ($TSLA)
2. General Motors ($GM)
3. Li Auto ($LI)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Liquidity Multiples](https://i.imgur.com/yAcorJo.png)**

Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. 

Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Leverage](https://i.imgur.com/LWNG0oE.png)**

Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. 

Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. 

General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don't think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard 

---

#**[Institutional Ownership](https://i.imgur.com/N4foBOn.png)**

This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM's EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla's lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

#**[Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)](https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc)**

Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone's concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors

- - -

And last but not least...

#**[Supply Chain Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png)**

The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. 

Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.

Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. 

1. General Motors ($GM) 
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don't regret it, however I don't look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I'm currently tied up in other investments. Here is the full album of the stats, enjoy!

### Market Notes:

I love a hot sector as much as anyone but these levels are completely insane! It's pretty great too...

The green/alternative energy sector is flying, the lower [the float](https://trading4keeps.com/whats-the-float-and-why-does-it-matter/), the bigger the move. I don't believe these price levels are sustainable for very long but always keep in mind the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

I'll continue to play the long side on these stocks with caution. The strategy I trade has me cash by noon.

Futures are higher this morning, if the current levels hold the S&amp;P 500 will open above critical resistance.

Large list today and almost everything on it is a low float, I've marked floats above 30 million with a (\*).

I would like to know, where and how to get quickly acquainted with a specific publicly traded company? Someplace where their business model, business activities, plans new and old + past fails would be described. This way, 10 - 15 minute read might be just enough to get the initial idea...

I know of [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) and its fine and all, but their executive summary is quite brief and more of their focus lies in cute graphics.

Yahoo finance has also some basic description, again, too broad.

[Koyfin.com](https://Koyfin.com) is BRILINAT ANALYTICAL TOOL, priceless in every aspect, BUT its all numbers, and one needs some prose as well..

&amp;#x200B;

If there is something you guys find usefull, any ideas are much appreciated.

I always focused on Global Macro, but I plan to chase **specific industries** now, as I think the idiosyncratic risk is diversifiable by buying the top 3 *(usually top 20-30% of the industry market share)* industry leaders. In my head it sounds as a genious way to diversify one's risk exposure into HYPE industries..

There be 144 industries, at least 3 industry leaders in each, math, blabla, that is a lot of stuff to go through thus any site, or tool designed to make this research less suicesidal IS WELCOME.

I’m curious what’s everyone’s opinion on if there is an EV bubble being created similar to the dot com bubble in 2000. 

Here are some quotes off Wikipedia that I think may be similar to what we are experiencing now:

Preclude to the bubble:
Wiki: The 1993 release of Mosaic and subsequent web browsers gave computer users access to the World Wide Web, greatly popularizing use of the Internet

2020: many traders are on Robinhood picking up “meme stocks” and lots of people unemployed, thus an increased interest in trading.

Wiki: At the same time, a decline in interest rates increased the availability of capital.

2020: fed has also decreased interest rates 

The bubble:
Wiki: As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any dot-com company, especially if it had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a "".com"" suffix in its name.

2020: Kinda different, but if you replace the .com/internet prefixes part with “EV” I think it carries a similar point/situation.

Wiki: At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a public company via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue

2020: sound familiar? Nikola?

Bursting of the bubble:
Wiki: On January 10, 2000, America Online, led by Steve Case and Ted Leonsis, announced a merger with Time Warner, led by Gerald M. Levin. The merger was the largest to date and was questioned by many analysts.

In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, Alan Greenspan announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

On March 20, 2000, Barron's featured a cover article titled ""Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash—fast"", which predicted the imminent bankruptcy of many Internet companies.This led many people to rethink their investments.

Enron and 9/11 also contributed to the bubble popping.

2020: ?

Overall I’m staying in the market, but I’ll be taking some profits. I am long on clean energy but even today was just too crazy for me with the EV rally.

Stocks rallied Monday, for the third straight week, after more positive vaccine news from AstraZeneca (AZN). The current surge in infections and hospitalizations across the US emphasizes the need for an effective vaccine to combat the virus. Despite record infections, the market has been broadly encouraged by the steady stream of good vaccine news the last three weeks.

Over the weekend, AstraZeneca (AZN) and the University of Oxford announced the results of their clinical trail which showed their vaccine candidate was highly effective at 90%, relatively cheap, and easy to store. The results are based on analysis of a study involving 11,363 participants in the UK and Brazil. Moreover, the company announced the vaccine can be stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning distribution can be done with existing infrastructure. These developments came on the heels of Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) announcing plans to file for an emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would allow them to have their vaccine used in the U.S. starting in December.

A successful vaccine is seen by market participants as a necessary component for safe, sustained, and broad economic reopening. According to Yahoo Finance, an estimated 27 million workers, around 22% of the workforce, work in close physical proximity with others. In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a vaccine is a crucial component. However, it is essential to note that even after approval by the requisite agencies, the production and distribution of literally billions of vaccine doses will be a massive and challenging logistical undertaking, unlikely to happen until 2021.

Expectations for relatively quick distribution of a vaccine have boosted the broader market this month and analyst expectations for 2021, despite the recent surge in cases. Cyclical and reopening stocks, that had previously underperformed are rallying, while previously high-flying, stay-at-home stocks, like Peleton (PTON), Zoom (ZM), and Netflix (NFLX) to retreat. However, given the uncertainty in Washington surrounding the election and stimulus and record Covid-19 infections, we expect volatility to keep up in the short-term.

It will be interesting to see how Apple’s small decline of 0.6% to 40.6 million units to Xiaomi’s 44.4 million, will shift in the next quarter, on the back of the company launching a new raft of iPhone 12 devices.

“Apple sold 40.5 million units in the third quarter of 2020, a decline of 0.6% as compared to 2019,” said Annette Zimmermann, research vice president at Gartner, in a statement. “The slight decrease was mainly due to Apple’s delayed shipment start of its new 2020 iPhone generation, which in previous years would always start mid/end September. This year, the launch event and shipment start began 4 weeks later than usual.”

Hey everyone and Welcome , so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indexes drop with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/r63grbk) being down 0,42%, finishing the week up 0,2%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9whHcdZ) down 0,68% and finishing 0,8% down for the week while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/9V3z9jd) lost 3 quarters of a percent as this was also the same percentage that it dropped for the week. The VIX went up 2,5% but finished the week flat as it has for the past couple of weeks after the election. There was about an even split of companies advancing to declining as the volume continues to drop. Though there was a sharp sell-off in the last 30minutes to end the trading week as I believe a lot of people don’t want to hold the money in the stock market over the weekend as cases of the illness rise in the US. [CHART](https://ibb.co/8gb1Csf) / [VIX](https://ibb.co/WsNMvGv)

Here is the heat map from yesterday and the heat map for the whole week and it’s obvious that this was a pretty much mixed week as financials and energy sectors have recovered a little bit of the ground they lost during the last 8 months of recovery while the leaders of the recovery, the big tech struggled a little this week. [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/r7QFV0m) / [WEEK](https://ibb.co/9VWyGGH)

Next week is pretty low on interesting earnings though I think I am going to try and buy some small pieces for companies like Best Buy, GAP and Hormel as I believe they may have some upside potential, I also think Dick’s sporting goods will do good but I think the expectations are a little high for that company and despite meeting the analyst expectations the retail investors might jump off the bandwagon and the stock may suffer. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/56yWLs9)

Also, important economic data will only come until Wednesday as the stock market and economic data take a break for Thanksgiving. The most important numbers coming are the MARKIT PMI’s, the consumer confidence index and a lot of critical data that comes in on Wednesday as you can see here [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZKHM2cD).

The worst performing sectors on Friday were financials, industrials and surprisingly technology also, while the only real bright spot were communication services. [CHART](https://ibb.co/Df47v43)

Some great news for online retailers came in as the first week of November saw a more than 80% increase in online shopping traffic with 20% less traffic around malls vs last year but an almost 60% increase since March. The rise of e-commerce is still expected to continue big in the next years as analysts expect sales to grow between 25 and 35%.

Moving on, two of the biggest giants in the tech sector and in the whole world, Apple and Microsoft also announced that they will team up to create a controller supported for IOS devices as the gaming industry has seen a huge spike and is expected to have huge growth in the coming years while Microsoft also seems to be targeting Zoom as they are removing the 40minute limit starting on Thanksgiving and are offering free all-day video calling via the TEAMS app. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0mwb9KR)

Just take care and don’t rush into winners just because they are up huge this year, look at companies that have potential just like DraftKings and Penn Gaming, as the companies have huge tailwind especially legalized gambling in more and more states with a growing online presence and sports expected to have big returns in the next years. With Boeing being another company that might struggle in the short-term but for the long-term I believe is still a great company to own as they are expected to also have the 737 max banning lifted in Europe in the next couple of months.

Also, car makers are getting more and more stamps of approval as they transition into the EV world, as 2 big Detroit giants GM and Ford are making a huge push to compete in the EV market with Tesla. The most recent was a buy rating from UPS on GM as they set the price at 50$ which implies a 16% upside.[NEWS](https://ibb.co/R3Y0WBP)

Just a quick mention as Netflix saw its stock up more than 1,5% on Friday as the company has struggled to regain momentum after weaker than expected growth in the last earnings report and has been dragged down by people selling the company after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine news. I still believe this is a great company as they and Disney will be the two biggest players in the streaming business in my opinion in the long run while ROKU also seems to be benefiting a lot from the dying of traditional TV as they are hitting all-time highs both in value for the company and subscribers.

So guys stay safe for the holidays as danger is still around, with the CDC urging people to not travel at home and also be safe while investing as the rift between the Treasury and the Fed may bring some volatility to the market unless a stimulus is passed by the time Biden taxes over even if the programs that will not be extended are not critical for the economy as they acted more like a backup in case of emergency. I believe the US should take the same approach as the UK which plans to present its biggest borrowing plan since World War Two.

Don’t rush into the market if you missed the rally until now as I believe there are a lot of people who kept cash on the sidelines and missed the best moments to invest this year as the human mind plays tricks on us, just try to stay sharp and not put all your eggs in one basket. Be diversified and choose great companies as I believe we might see the market going up until the end of the year  as December has been one of the best performing months for the stock market over the time, with stocks seeing the Santa Claus effect almost every year while we also have to wait and see if the FDA approves the Pfizer vaccine on the 10th of December which I believe will be a good catalyst for the market as it has traded sideways. Today we also got news that Regeneron’s antibody cocktail has just received emergency use authorization from the FDA, this is the drug that was administered to Trump and made him have a quick recovery from the illness.

### Market Notes:

For the third Monday in a row, there is new of a vaccine for COVID-19. This one is by **AZN** and is reportedly 70% effective.

Markets will trade a short week. We will be closed on Thursday and only a 1/2 day on Friday. I will be trading Friday.

Futures are up near Thursday and Friday's highs which is also a key resistance level. I believe my bullish call is still intact but I'm still ready to be proven wrong.

### Watchlist:

**CPSH** is a low float, watching for a setup above $3

**IDT** is a low float, with support at $12

**KIRK** is a low float, resistance at $13.58

**KXIN** is a low float, watching for a set above $8

**SUP** is a lowish float, resistance at $5

**EOSE** is a lowish float, on watch

**IDRA** is a lowish float, support at $3.50

share my biased view. After a breakout of the first rounding top, SPY fell -0.72% and then recovered to 358. SPY formed another rounding top (ish) pattern from the 11/17 - 11/19 before dropping -1.07%. Again she formed a rounding top from 11/19 - 11/20. SPY could drop down to 351.31 (ish) by Monday and Tuesday and quickly recover to 358 - 363 by Wednesday or Thursday. It’s something to look out for if SPY nears 351.31.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](1cv4zaha4x061 ""\n"")\n\nHowever, SPY appears to be forming a descending bearish triangle.

She stayed within the 358-355.5 range.

However the 11/20 dump appears to be more violent. Because of this identical nature, I bought a 360c 11/27 lotto at the bottom that I’ll look at selling in the 11/23 AM if we get close to 357-358 and eat lobster.

After a breakout of the first rounding top, SPY fell -0.72% and then recovered to 358. SPY formed another rounding top (ish) pattern from the 11/17 - 11/19 before dropping -1.07%. Again she formed a rounding top from 11/19 - 11/20. SPY could drop down to 351.31 (ish) by Monday and Tuesday and quickly recover to 358 - 363 by Wednesday or Thursday. It’s something to look out for if SPY nears 351.31.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;![img](1cv4zaha4x061 &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, SPY appears to be forming a descending bearish triangle.

# It's no secret that Cyberpunk 2077 release is a very material event for CD Projekt ($OTGLY). I have about $125,000 worth of shares and following anything that happens with that company online. Cyberpunk 2077 will be released on Dec 10th.

Gaming footage was release from people working in retail who stole the game for their own pleasure. There is also reports that Amazon has received physical copies.

So the big news from the leak is:

1. No further delays. Physical copies are out there. This was a big worry since the game was delayed 4 times. So I expect the price to jump since that risk is no longer there.
2. Game looks crisp!!
3. These leaks do not include the 0-day patches.
4. People have spend 180 hours playing the game and there is plenty of material to play.
5. There is a Mike Tyson cameo
6. System requirements are decent

Checking out the number of active users of [r/cyberpunkgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/) for hype and they have 439k members and 8.1k are online. Comparing that to [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) there are 1600k members and 12k are online.

Just the fact that we know the game is not going to be further delay should give us an edge compared to slow Wallstreet analysts who will take a whole week to update their pricing models.

I found an amazing write up about the company here by these guys:

NIGHTMANT\n\nCurrent Stock Price (11/22/20 - 10:47 AM): $8.09\n\nSentiment: Buy\n\nPositions: Shares\n\nRisk: High\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nAyro is the maker of purpose-built EVs. Their mission is to create sustainable electric vehicles for college campuses, ""last-mile"" delivery solutions, ""urban commuting,"" and ""closed campus"" transportation. Their offerings included a light-duty truck and a compact delivery vehicle. \n\nAYRO has had a highly volatile share price over the past 3 months. Over the past year, AYRO\'s weekly volatility (20 percent) has been steady but is still above 75 percent of US stocks. They make less than USD$1M in revenue ($966K). But, revenue grew by 19.3% over the past year and they have sufficient cash for at least 1 year of operations. \n\nThey don\'t pay a dividend and their current market cap is $197M.  However, they do not have “high-quality” earnings because they are unprofitable. They are a growth company with high upside. Aryo has had a 7-day total return of 102% compared to 16.0% of all US auto stocks. There is insufficient data to determine how AYRO performed against the US Auto Industry.\n\nAYRO focuses mainly on the North American LSEV market. According to Wise Guy Research, the U.S. market is highly competitive and represents 28 percent of the overall LSEV market. \n\nAYRO estimates that over 1,800 higher education campuses with over 400 on-campus vehicles are ideal targets for the AYRO 411 Fleet in the U.S. This is the basis for more than 535,000 cars that need to be converted from gas-powered to hybrid vehicles. With an estimated exchange price of $14,000, this reflects a more than $7 billion potential market. \n\nIncreased competition might result in lower prices of vehicle units and reduced inventory, which can lead to downward market pressure. Such variables could adversely affect the company, financial position, operating performance.\n\nAYRO\'s most closely-matched rival in the LSEV industry is Polaris Gem. Polaris is an LSEV company manufacturing goods designed for applications identical to AYRO\'s. Three passenger car models and two utility vehicle models are sold by Gem. The GEM el XD, which is identical to the AYRO 411 fleet, has a lower starting MSRP than the 411 Fleet. However, the GEM el XD will need to be highly modified to meet the standard features of the AYRO 411 Fleet and would surpass the base MSRP AYRO 411 Fleet vehicle with such a configuration.\n\nIn September of 2020, Ayro Inc. partnered with Karma Automotive LLC in the production of 20,000 electric vehicles through 2023. Manufacturing near Los Angeles, Karma will assist in the engineering and design of the electric vehicles. The contract is valued at over $300 million. Karma\'s manufacturing facility is about 556,000 square feet and was built to cater to highly customized premium electric vehicles. \n\nIn August of 2020, a unique collaboration with AYRO, Inc. and Club Car has been announced by Gallery. They are to launch a new line of electric cars to help consumers safely deliver food, beverage, and retail merchandise to buyers this fall. The new electric vehicles feature convenient hot and cold storage and dispensing to ensure the safe storage, transportation, and delivery of food and beverage goods. \n\nAYRO entered into a five-year Master Procurement Agreement with Club Car in March 2019 for the purchase of four-wheeled vehicles through AYRO. The MPA grants Club Car the exclusive right to sell the AYRO 411 Fleet in North America, provided that the number of AYRO units per year is mutually agreed upon by Club Car. AYRO has also agreed to work with Club Car to develop new products similar to the AYRO 411 Fleet and to upgrade existing products. \n\nAYRO is currently engaged in negotiations with Club Car to create additional goods to be marketed in Europe and Asia by Club Car, but there can be no guarantee that these discussions will succeed.\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6d8gf9ydu061.png?width=1250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af6b7f577f2b88bbf550c498a652cf2dc3a3c9fe\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn9uqu55eu061.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=372cdd675c5d5d22a2723d6335759c8a8cde2fbc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9o22jz38eu061.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8cec0c03c55ea53c4c0da28c38d1cae9b26688a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxum86fceu061.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a15729459a8b07dce0e823ec5fd8c080c8ba7fae\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8maxjn8heu061.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bc168cd42a90ccba19b9bdafbfab1787b7c616c\n\n**FINANCIAL HEALTH**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vcho4w8neu061.png?width=1334&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a31c1535069b5450249bf4d604fde1d71cc78ce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iay7041teu061.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fc511c67c5498ea90e9431792bf12d9f2dd6c84\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ortz19hveu061.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c9ad31f0eecf4fbdcae2be23c381612aef2b164\n\nBased on its current free cash flow, AYRO has an ample cash runway of more than 3 years. If free cash flow tends to decline at historical rates of 43.9 \n\npercent per year, AYRO has an ample cash runway for 2.4 years.\n\n# PRODUCT OVERVIEW\n\nListed on their website, the ""AYRO 311 autocycle comes complete with a revolutionary chassis design, inline seating, and four-door access for an unparalleled road experience perfect for professional and personal use.""\n\nThe Ayro 311 use cases:\n\n* Parcel/mail Delivery\n* Public Safety\n* Cargo Delivery\n* Food Delivery\n* parking enforcement\n* Personal Use\n\nThe AEV 311 has an MSRP starting price of $9,999 and is available at one of AEV Technologies\' Authorized Dealers.\n\nTheir light-duty truck is called the ""Club Car 411."" They state that it\'s ""a compact all-electric vehicle designed for your campus. Ideal for low-speed logistics and cargo services, it has the agility and versatility essential in a campus or urban environment, filling the gap between full-sized trucks and small utility carts"". \n\nThe Ayro Club Car 411 use cases:\n\n* Maintenance\n* Services\n* Events\n* Kiosk\n* Catering\n* Delivery\n\nThe Club Car 411 has an SRP rating of $28.900 and is available at Club Car’s Authorized Dealers. \n\n# THE CURRENT EV INDUSTRY\n\nLow-speed electric cars, which cannot be powered by gas or diesel fuel, are becoming more popular as eco-friendly alternatives for consumers and organizations in the electric car market. LSEVs function on electric motors driven by different batteries, such as lithium-ion, molten salt, zinc-air, and various nickel designs. \n\nMany analysts expect the U.S. electric car industry to increase significantly over the next decade, led by factors such as the rapidly urbanized population of the country, the significant expense of owning and running diesel-powered cars, the rising global recognition of the adverse effects of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing investment in renewable technologies.\n\nIn 2020, due to the global economic slowdown driven by COVID-19, the global low-speed electric vehicle market is expected to decline. The sector, though, will rebound in 2021, and by 2025, it is projected to hit an unprecedented $8.83 billion with a CAGR of 0 percent to 2 percent from 2020 to 2025.\n\n### EXPANDING GOVERNMENT POLICIES\n\nIn the LSEV industry, the expanding rules and regulations on vehicle emissions have contributed to growth. Specific legislation limiting automotive emissions has been enforced by the U.S., Germany, France, and China. These regulations have forced car makers to use new technology to combat high-emission standards in cars.\n\nMany jurisdictions are gradually providing significant incentives for consumers to buy electric cars to promote clean-energy use, such as tax credits, rebates, and exemptions; reduced vehicle registration fees; reduced electricity rates; and parking incentives.\n\n[Also, local policymakers are establishing standards for infrastructure to support the growth of the electric car industry.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/state-electric-vehicle-incentives-state-chart.aspx)\n\nWith Joe Biden looking to win the election, renewable energy stocks such as AYRO are shining a spotlight\n\n[Biden’s Clean Energy Plan](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/#)\n\nBiden aims to create 1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry, domestic car supply chains, and automotive facilities. From parts to components to charging stations for electric cars, Biden wants to prepare American car employees and suppliers to conquer the 21st century. To place America as the world leader in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and their raw materials and components, Biden will use all the federal government\'s levers, from purchasing power, R&amp;D, trade, and procurement policies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tusgjc55fu061.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8daaca3ef9bbb0f1b7fe2fe8865191441fa81db6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zdz9w97fu061.png?width=1294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b628847dd8e4582b2feb6d4b058f9a0b62781f13\n\n### URBANIZATION GROWTH\n\nIn 2015, 55 percent of the world\'s population was metropolitan, according to the U.N., and by 2050, this figure is expected to rise to 68 percent.\n\nHowever, Americans leaving towns in droves are grossly overstated due to COVID-19.  64 percent of prospective homebuyers on the web are searching at suburban locations. According to Jeff Tucker, an economist at the online real estate service Zillow, this statistic has hardly budged from previous years. Searches for land in rural and metropolitan regions represent almost the same percentage as before.\n\nUndoubtedly, cities around the world have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis.  For example, large urban centers in the United Kingdom and the USA have higher mortality rates than other settlement types. Population size has also been found to play a critical role in determining infection rates.\n\nProfessor Time Dixon, University of Reading, states that ""It is the ‘urban poor’ who suffer most in the immediacy of the pandemic...We are already seeing a similar impact with COVID-19 as its effects are forecast by the World Bank to push about 49 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 (Sanchez-Paramo, 2020). City leaders and decision-makers in the global north and the south therefore face a ‘perfect storm’ of how best to deal with recovery planning and management from COVID-19 alongside the existing pressures of climate change, resource depletion and continued socioeconomic inequalities."" An impending recession may put green energy initiatives on the back burner as governments attempt to dodge an economic depression.\n\n### TARGET MARKETS\n\nLSEVs\' multi-purpose applications and renewable energy usage make them popular in a wide variety of sectors and clients, including college and university campuses, resorts and hotels, corporate parks, hospitals, warehouses, individual consumers, suppliers of last-mile distribution systems, governments, and the foodservice industry.\n\nAYRO focuses mainly on the North American LSEV market. .According to Wise Guy Research, the U.S. market is highly competitive and represents 28 percent of the overall LSEV market. \n\nLSEVs are becoming increasingly common on university and college campuses. They better serve the flexible needs of campuses than golf carts or traditional combustion vehicles. Not only does the low-speed threshold of LSEVs promote safer driving among staff, but the cars are street legal with on-road safety features, allowing drivers to operate on roads and free up pedestrian space along sidewalks and smaller roads.\n\n[Club Car, AYRO\'s strategic partner, provides a grant program for colleges and universities to accelerate the drive towards a more prosperous, low-carbon future. Universities can receive a custom Club Car Carryall vehicle up to a value of $10,000 for pilot use.  A supplemental fleet audit from Club Car will be offered to three additional applicants to determine their current fleet\'s capacity. ](https://www.clubcar.com/content/dam/cc-corp/documents/pdf/Literature/Commercial/Markets/Education/Club%20Car%20Campus%20Sustainability%20Grant%20Program%20Application.pdf)\n\nCampuses could significantly decrease the costs incurred on diesel, gasoline, components, and repairs by converting from internal combustion engine vehicles into LSEVs. AYRO\'s cars, notably the AYRO 411 Fleet, provide college and university campuses with these benefits. \n\nAYRO estimates that over 1,800 higher education campuses with over 400 on-campus vehicles are ideal targets for the AYRO 411 Fleet in the U.S. This is the basis for more than 535,000 cars that need to be converted from gas-powered to hybrid vehicles. With an estimated exchange price of $14,000, this reflects a more than $7 billion potential market. \n\nCustomers continually embrace ease and timeliness, fostering rapid development in online shopping and distribution systems across a wide variety of sectors, including home delivery and restaurant ordering services.\n\nAccording to Upserve, food distribution revenues are projected to grow over 20 percent each year, resulting in an expected $365 billion worldwide by 2030. Upserve also reports that nearly 60 percent of U.S. customers say that they order delivery or takeout at least once a week. According to Morgan Stanley, within the next decade, potentially over 40% of restaurant sales will be attributable to delivery services. \n\nAYRO has estimated that restaurants have lowered their delivery costs by up to 50 percent using the AYRO 311 as a delivery vehicle rather than outsourcing deliveries to third party systems. Additionally, delivery services that use AYRO 311 are well-positioned to optimize customer experience and preserve customer relationships. \n\nA [2016 Mintel survey](http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/9-in-10-us-food-delivery-service-users-say-it-makes-their-lives-easier) showed that ""12 percent of Americans say they have used third-party delivery service in the past three months. Among non-users, 30 percent say they would rather order delivery directly from the restaurant itself."" \n\nThird-party online ordering platforms charge commissions on each order, ranging between 15% to 40%.How do they get away with charging such exorbitant fees? It’s only a matter of time before restaurants catch on and these platforms start to  lose market share. \n\nDue to the boom in shopping online, retail\'s focus on last-mile distribution - the transfer of goods from a logistics hub to the final delivery destination - has increased exponentially over the past few years. Last-mile delivery gives consumers more convenient and faster delivery solutions that the other three shipping systems in the U.S.do not provide. Also, retailers may need to continue deploying eco-friendly cars due to the [growing establishment of low-emission zones in urban centers.](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/california-city-santa-monica-maps-first-us-zero-emission-delivery-zone)\n\n[The Zero Emissions Roadmap 2.0](https://laincubator.org/roadmap/)\n\nDue to their zero gas emissions and lower cost than rival electric cars, retailers are expected to increase the usage of LSEV fleets to render delivery in low emission zones. AYRO expects the AYRO 411 Fleet will stand out from the opposition with its range of cargo bed options and its lower price point. Also, for smaller packages and urgent courier-style deliveries, the AYRO 311 car cycle is suitable for quick point-destination deliveries.\n\nCities are progressively looking to replace their public buses with zero-emission fleets as more local councils introduce regulations to minimize emissions from cars. However, such fleet overhauls can be costly. For cities daunted by standard electric vehicles\' cost, LSEVs are a cheaper and an even more realistic alternative. The LSEVs of AYRO have capacities both on and off-road, making them remarkably flexible for municipalities.\n\n### COMPETITORS\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive, especially for inexpensive and alternative fuel vehicles, and AYRO expects it to become even more competitive in the future. Other suppliers have joined the market for three-wheeled cars, and AYRO expects more rivals to enter the market within the next few years.\n\nIn the global LSEV industry, the most competitive firms include HDK Electric Vehicles, Bradshaw Electric Vehicles, Textron Inc., Polaris Industries, Yamaha Motors Co. Ltd., Speedway Electric, Ingersoll Rand, Inc., AGT Electric Automobiles, Bintelli Electric Vehicles, and Ligier Group. The partnership between AYRO and Club Car, an Ingersoll Rand, Inc. division, gives AYRO a decisive strategic advantage.\n\nDespite this fact, many of the other competitors identified above have substantially greater financial, technological, production, marketing, and other resources than AYRO and will devote more resources to designing, creating, processing, shipping, promoting, selling, and supporting their goods.\n\nUnlike the AYRO 411 Fleet, which was engineered, designed, and manufactured as a portfolio of hybrid, medium-duty trucks and vans, all of these rivals adapt an existing fossil-fuel driven golf cart to fulfill utility and industrial requirements for an all-electric commercial utility vehicle.\n\nAYRO\'s cars are slightly more competitive than internal combustion engine vehicles, based on tax, title and license fees, and CO2 emissions. If renewed electricity is used to charge the AYRO vehicles, an increasing practice for most higher education campuses and government facilities, the AYRO 411 Fleet has an estimated 49 percent reduction in operating costs and an approximate 100 percent reduction in CO2 emissions compared to a typical Ford F150 (gasoline) pickup truck. \n\nThe AYRO 311 offers a drastic reduction in running costs and CO2 emissions relative to the Nissan Versa (gasoline) four-cylinder (1.6 liters) sub-compact vehicle. Additionally, the suggested retail price of the AYRO 311\'s is $9,999 MSRP. Respectively, Arcimoto and SOLO sector three-wheeled electric cars have starting MSRPs of $19,900 and $15,888. \n\nAYRO\'s most closely-matched rival in the LSEV industry is Polaris Gem. Polaris is an LSEV company manufacturing goods designed for applications identical to AYRO\'s. Three passenger car models and two utility vehicle models are sold by Gem. The GEM el XD, which is identical to the AYRO 411 fleet, has a lower starting MSRP than the 411 Fleet. However, the GEM el XD will need to be highly modified to meet the standard features of the AYRO 411 Fleet and would surpass the base MSRP of each AYRO 411 Fleet vehicle with such a configuration.\n\nIn addition to 13 percent more horsepower and a 48 percent improved turning radius, the AYRO 411 fleet has a more significant pickup bed and box room than the GEM el XD. Such features help drivers of the AYRO 411 Fleet to perform maneuvers in smaller spaces than they can use the GEM el XD.\n\nIn view of the increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, ongoing globalization, and restructuring in the worldwide automotive sector, AYRO expects competition in its industry to intensify in the future. Product quality and features, time for innovation and growth, cost, durability, protection, customer care, and financing terms are factors impacting competitiveness. Increased competition might result in lower prices of vehicle units and reduced inventory, which can lead to downward market pressure. Such variables could adversely affect the company, financial position, operating performance, and prospects of AYRO.\n\n# RECENT PARTNERSHIPS AND NOTABLE NEWS\n\n[**September 29, 2020**](https://froggyweb.com/2020/09/29/ev-makers-ayro-karma-team-up-to-manufacture-delivery-vehicles/)\n\nAccording to Reuters, Ayro Inc. will partner with Karma Automotive LLC in the production of 20,000 electric vehicles through 2023. \n\nManufacturing near Los Angeles, Karma will assist in the engineering and design of the electric vehicles.

The MPA grants Club Car the exclusive right to sell the AYRO 411 Fleet in North America, provided that the number of AYRO units per year is mutually agreed upon by Club Car.\n\nUnder the provisions of the MPA, AYRO accepts orders for vehicles of unique models from Club Car suppliers, and AYRO invoices Club Car after the vehicle has been delivered. The MPA has an initial term of five years beginning on 1 January 2019 and may be renewed by Club Car on 60 days of prior written notice for successive one-year periods.\n\nAYRO has also agreed to work with Club Car to develop new products similar to the AYRO 411 Fleet and to upgrade existing products. AYRO has given Club Car the right to initially decline to buy similar commercial utility vehicles produced by AYRO during the MPA era.\n\nAYRO is currently engaged in negotiations with Club Car to create additional goods to be marketed in Europe and Asia by Club Car, but there can be no guarantee that these discussions will succeed. According to the MPA, in the event that AYRO decides to sell 51% or more of its assets or equity interests, AYRO has also given Club Car the right of first refusal, which is exercisable for a period of 45 days following the issuance of the acquisition notice to Club Car by AYRO.\n\n[**August 2019**](https://fordauthority.com/2019/08/ford-mobilitys-autonomic-and-ev-maker-ayro-partner-up/#:~:text=Autonomic%20and%20a%20company%20called,Mobility%20cloud%20or%20TMC%20platform.&amp;text=Ford%20Mobility%20purchased%20Autonomic%20in,services%20and%20autonomous%20car%20rollout.)\n\nAYRO is creating a technology framework that can be deployed as additional value-add subscriptions directly offered to the end-user on every car.\n\nAYRO has collaborated with Autonomic, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford Smart Mobility LLC, in its transportation mobility cloud to gather vehicle health, utilization, and location information (telematics) and deliver purpose-built data back to AYRO, clients, and fleet operators, generating an additional revenue stream.\n\nThe companies plan to create a range of services to enable AYRO\'s line of vehicles to be mobile application friendly. \n\n**2017**\n\nIn a supply chain partnership to provide sub-assembly manufacturing facilities, AYRO partnered with Cenntro Automotive Group, Ltd., which operates a large electric vehicle plant in the automotive district of Hangzhou, China.\n\nCenntro received nineteen percent (19 percent) of AYRO\'s common stock through the alliance. \n\nAs of December 31, 2019, Cenntro beneficially owned approximately 13.7 percent. \n\nThe production of the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles is owned by Cenntro and AYRO has been \n\ngiven an exclusive license to import the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles for sale in North America.\n\nCenntro is also used for the production of sub-assemblies of AYRO 311. For both the 411 and 311 models, AYRO imports semi-knocked-down vehicle kits from Cenntro.\n\nAYRO\'s manufacturing plant in Round Rock, Texas, collects the vehicle kits by shipping containers. With minimal customization requirements per order, the vehicles are then assembled. \n\nAs such the collaboration with Cenntro enables AYRO to ramp up production activities without substantial capital spending commitments, thus rapidly selling goods.\n\nA knock-down kit is a series of parts needed to assemble a package (also a knock-down kit, knocked-down kit, or simply knockdown or KD). In one country or region, the pieces are usually assembled, and shipped for final assembly to another country or region.\n\nIn the automobile, taxi, heavy truck and rail vehicle sectors, as well as electronics, furniture and other items, CKD is a prevalent activity. \n\nBusinesses offer knocked-down packages to their overseas counterparts or licensees for a number of purposes, including avoiding import duties, obtaining tax preferences for local manufacturing jobs, or simply being accepted as a bidder by other corporations.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to more full and more digestible document: &lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G8ZNpVTLp6fhwmpXGE4ib6ppBqZNJR0BBwqcqv_HD6c/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G8ZNpVTLp6fhwmpXGE4ib6ppBqZNJR0BBwqcqv_HD6c/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BY NIGHTMANT&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current Stock Price (11/22/20 - 10:47 AM): $8.09&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment: Buy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Positions: Shares&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Risk: High&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ayro is the maker of purpose-built EVs. Their mission is to create sustainable electric vehicles for college campuses, &amp;quot;last-mile&amp;quot; delivery solutions, &amp;quot;urban commuting,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;closed campus&amp;quot; transportation. Their offerings included a light-duty truck and a compact delivery vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO has had a highly volatile share price over the past 3 months. Over the past year, AYRO&amp;#39;s weekly volatility (20 percent) has been steady but is still above 75 percent of US stocks. They make less than USD$1M in revenue ($966K). But, revenue grew by 19.3% over the past year and they have sufficient cash for at least 1 year of operations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t pay a dividend and their current market cap is $197M.  However, they do not have “high-quality” earnings because they are unprofitable. They are a growth company with high upside. Aryo has had a 7-day total return of 102% compared to 16.0% of all US auto stocks. There is insufficient data to determine how AYRO performed against the US Auto Industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO focuses mainly on the North American LSEV market. According to Wise Guy Research, the U.S. market is highly competitive and represents 28 percent of the overall LSEV market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO estimates that over 1,800 higher education campuses with over 400 on-campus vehicles are ideal targets for the AYRO 411 Fleet in the U.S. This is the basis for more than 535,000 cars that need to be converted from gas-powered to hybrid vehicles. With an estimated exchange price of $14,000, this reflects a more than $7 billion potential market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Increased competition might result in lower prices of vehicle units and reduced inventory, which can lead to downward market pressure. Such variables could adversely affect the company, financial position, operating performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO&amp;#39;s most closely-matched rival in the LSEV industry is Polaris Gem. Polaris is an LSEV company manufacturing goods designed for applications identical to AYRO&amp;#39;s. Three passenger car models and two utility vehicle models are sold by Gem. The GEM el XD, which is identical to the AYRO 411 fleet, has a lower starting MSRP than the 411 Fleet. However, the GEM el XD will need to be highly modified to meet the standard features of the AYRO 411 Fleet and would surpass the base MSRP AYRO 411 Fleet vehicle with such a configuration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In September of 2020, Ayro Inc. partnered with Karma Automotive LLC in the production of 20,000 electric vehicles through 2023. Manufacturing near Los Angeles, Karma will assist in the engineering and design of the electric vehicles. The contract is valued at over $300 million. Karma&amp;#39;s manufacturing facility is about 556,000 square feet and was built to cater to highly customized premium electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In August of 2020, a unique collaboration with AYRO, Inc. and Club Car has been announced by Gallery. They are to launch a new line of electric cars to help consumers safely deliver food, beverage, and retail merchandise to buyers this fall. The new electric vehicles feature convenient hot and cold storage and dispensing to ensure the safe storage, transportation, and delivery of food and beverage goods. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO entered into a five-year Master Procurement Agreement with Club Car in March 2019 for the purchase of four-wheeled vehicles through AYRO. The MPA grants Club Car the exclusive right to sell the AYRO 411 Fleet in North America, provided that the number of AYRO units per year is mutually agreed upon by Club Car. AYRO has also agreed to work with Club Car to develop new products similar to the AYRO 411 Fleet and to upgrade existing products. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO is currently engaged in negotiations with Club Car to create additional goods to be marketed in Europe and Asia by Club Car, but there can be no guarantee that these discussions will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VALUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/t6d8gf9ydu061.png?width=1250&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=af6b7f577f2b88bbf550c498a652cf2dc3a3c9fe""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t6d8gf9ydu061.png?width=1250&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=af6b7f577f2b88bbf550c498a652cf2dc3a3c9fe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/bn9uqu55eu061.png?width=1306&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=372cdd675c5d5d22a2723d6335759c8a8cde2fbc""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bn9uqu55eu061.png?width=1306&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=372cdd675c5d5d22a2723d6335759c8a8cde2fbc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/9o22jz38eu061.png?width=1318&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e8cec0c03c55ea53c4c0da28c38d1cae9b26688a""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9o22jz38eu061.png?width=1318&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e8cec0c03c55ea53c4c0da28c38d1cae9b26688a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/sxum86fceu061.png?width=1326&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a15729459a8b07dce0e823ec5fd8c080c8ba7fae""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/sxum86fceu061.png?width=1326&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a15729459a8b07dce0e823ec5fd8c080c8ba7fae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/8maxjn8heu061.png?width=1308&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2bc168cd42a90ccba19b9bdafbfab1787b7c616c""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8maxjn8heu061.png?width=1308&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2bc168cd42a90ccba19b9bdafbfab1787b7c616c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINANCIAL HEALTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/vcho4w8neu061.png?width=1334&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1a31c1535069b5450249bf4d604fde1d71cc78ce""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vcho4w8neu061.png?width=1334&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1a31c1535069b5450249bf4d604fde1d71cc78ce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/iay7041teu061.png?width=1324&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9fc511c67c5498ea90e9431792bf12d9f2dd6c84""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/iay7041teu061.png?width=1324&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9fc511c67c5498ea90e9431792bf12d9f2dd6c84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ortz19hveu061.png?width=1328&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6c9ad31f0eecf4fbdcae2be23c381612aef2b164""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ortz19hveu061.png?width=1328&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6c9ad31f0eecf4fbdcae2be23c381612aef2b164&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on its current free cash flow, AYRO has an ample cash runway of more than 3 years.

LSEVs function on electric motors driven by different batteries, such as lithium-ion, molten salt, zinc-air, and various nickel designs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many analysts expect the U.S. electric car industry to increase significantly over the next decade, led by factors such as the rapidly urbanized population of the country, the significant expense of owning and running diesel-powered cars, the rising global recognition of the adverse effects of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing investment in renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2020, due to the global economic slowdown driven by COVID-19, the global low-speed electric vehicle market is expected to decline. The sector, though, will rebound in 2021, and by 2025, it is projected to hit an unprecedented $8.83 billion with a CAGR of 0 percent to 2 percent from 2020 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;EXPANDING GOVERNMENT POLICIES&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the LSEV industry, the expanding rules and regulations on vehicle emissions have contributed to growth. Specific legislation limiting automotive emissions has been enforced by the U.S., Germany, France, and China. These regulations have forced car makers to use new technology to combat high-emission standards in cars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many jurisdictions are gradually providing significant incentives for consumers to buy electric cars to promote clean-energy use, such as tax credits, rebates, and exemptions; reduced vehicle registration fees; reduced electricity rates; and parking incentives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/state-electric-vehicle-incentives-state-chart.aspx""&gt;Also, local policymakers are establishing standards for infrastructure to support the growth of the electric car industry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Joe Biden looking to win the election, renewable energy stocks such as AYRO are shining a spotlight&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/#""&gt;Biden’s Clean Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Biden aims to create 1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry, domestic car supply chains, and automotive facilities. From parts to components to charging stations for electric cars, Biden wants to prepare American car employees and suppliers to conquer the 21st century. To place America as the world leader in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and their raw materials and components, Biden will use all the federal government&amp;#39;s levers, from purchasing power, R&amp;amp;D, trade, and procurement policies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/tusgjc55fu061.png?width=1304&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8daaca3ef9bbb0f1b7fe2fe8865191441fa81db6""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tusgjc55fu061.png?width=1304&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8daaca3ef9bbb0f1b7fe2fe8865191441fa81db6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/7zdz9w97fu061.png?width=1294&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b628847dd8e4582b2feb6d4b058f9a0b62781f13""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7zdz9w97fu061.png?width=1294&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b628847dd8e4582b2feb6d4b058f9a0b62781f13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;URBANIZATION GROWTH&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2015, 55 percent of the world&amp;#39;s population was metropolitan, according to the U.N., and by 2050, this figure is expected to rise to 68 percent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, Americans leaving towns in droves are grossly overstated due to COVID-19.  64 percent of prospective homebuyers on the web are searching at suburban locations. According to Jeff Tucker, an economist at the online real estate service Zillow, this statistic has hardly budged from previous years. Searches for land in rural and metropolitan regions represent almost the same percentage as before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, cities around the world have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis.  For example, large urban centers in the United Kingdom and the USA have higher mortality rates than other settlement types. Population size has also been found to play a critical role in determining infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Professor Time Dixon, University of Reading, states that &amp;quot;It is the ‘urban poor’ who suffer most in the immediacy of the pandemic...We are already seeing a similar impact with COVID-19 as its effects are forecast by the World Bank to push about 49 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 (Sanchez-Paramo, 2020). City leaders and decision-makers in the global north and the south therefore face a ‘perfect storm’ of how best to deal with recovery planning and management from COVID-19 alongside the existing pressures of climate change, resource depletion and continued socioeconomic inequalities.&amp;quot; An impending recession may put green energy initiatives on the back burner as governments attempt to dodge an economic depression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;TARGET MARKETS&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LSEVs&amp;#39; multi-purpose applications and renewable energy usage make them popular in a wide variety of sectors and clients, including college and university campuses, resorts and hotels, corporate parks, hospitals, warehouses, individual consumers, suppliers of last-mile distribution systems, governments, and the foodservice industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO focuses mainly on the North American LSEV market. .According to Wise Guy Research, the U.S. market is highly competitive and represents 28 percent of the overall LSEV market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LSEVs are becoming increasingly common on university and college campuses. They better serve the flexible needs of campuses than golf carts or traditional combustion vehicles. Not only does the low-speed threshold of LSEVs promote safer driving among staff, but the cars are street legal with on-road safety features, allowing drivers to operate on roads and free up pedestrian space along sidewalks and smaller roads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.clubcar.com/content/dam/cc-corp/documents/pdf/Literature/Commercial/Markets/Education/Club%20Car%20Campus%20Sustainability%20Grant%20Program%20Application.pdf""&gt;Club Car, AYRO&amp;#39;s strategic partner, provides a grant program for colleges and universities to accelerate the drive towards a more prosperous, low-carbon future. Universities can receive a custom Club Car Carryall vehicle up to a value of $10,000 for pilot use.  A supplemental fleet audit from Club Car will be offered to three additional applicants to determine their current fleet&amp;#39;s capacity. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Campuses could significantly decrease the costs incurred on diesel, gasoline, components, and repairs by converting from internal combustion engine vehicles into LSEVs. AYRO&amp;#39;s cars, notably the AYRO 411 Fleet, provide college and university campuses with these benefits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO estimates that over 1,800 higher education campuses with over 400 on-campus vehicles are ideal targets for the AYRO 411 Fleet in the U.S. This is the basis for more than 535,000 cars that need to be converted from gas-powered to hybrid vehicles. With an estimated exchange price of $14,000, this reflects a more than $7 billion potential market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers continually embrace ease and timeliness, fostering rapid development in online shopping and distribution systems across a wide variety of sectors, including home delivery and restaurant ordering services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Upserve, food distribution revenues are projected to grow over 20 percent each year, resulting in an expected $365 billion worldwide by 2030. Upserve also reports that nearly 60 percent of U.S. customers say that they order delivery or takeout at least once a week. According to Morgan Stanley, within the next decade, potentially over 40% of restaurant sales will be attributable to delivery services. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO has estimated that restaurants have lowered their delivery costs by up to 50 percent using the AYRO 311 as a delivery vehicle rather than outsourcing deliveries to third party systems. Additionally, delivery services that use AYRO 311 are well-positioned to optimize customer experience and preserve customer relationships. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=""http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/9-in-10-us-food-delivery-service-users-say-it-makes-their-lives-easier""&gt;2016 Mintel survey&lt;/a&gt; showed that &amp;quot;12 percent of Americans say they have used third-party delivery service in the past three months. Among non-users, 30 percent say they would rather order delivery directly from the restaurant itself.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third-party online ordering platforms charge commissions on each order, ranging between 15% to 40%.How do they get away with charging such exorbitant fees? It’s only a matter of time before restaurants catch on and these platforms start to  lose market share. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the boom in shopping online, retail&amp;#39;s focus on last-mile distribution - the transfer of goods from a logistics hub to the final delivery destination - has increased exponentially over the past few years. Last-mile delivery gives consumers more convenient and faster delivery solutions that the other three shipping systems in the U.S.do not provide. Also, retailers may need to continue deploying eco-friendly cars due to the &lt;a href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/article/california-city-santa-monica-maps-first-us-zero-emission-delivery-zone""&gt;growing establishment of low-emission zones in urban centers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://laincubator.org/roadmap/""&gt;The Zero Emissions Roadmap 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to their zero gas emissions and lower cost than rival electric cars, retailers are expected to increase the usage of LSEV fleets to render delivery in low emission zones. AYRO expects the AYRO 411 Fleet will stand out from the opposition with its range of cargo bed options and its lower price point. Also, for smaller packages and urgent courier-style deliveries, the AYRO 311 car cycle is suitable for quick point-destination deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cities are progressively looking to replace their public buses with zero-emission fleets as more local councils introduce regulations to minimize emissions from cars. However, such fleet overhauls can be costly. For cities daunted by standard electric vehicles&amp;#39; cost, LSEVs are a cheaper and an even more realistic alternative. The LSEVs of AYRO have capacities both on and off-road, making them remarkably flexible for municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;COMPETITORS&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive, especially for inexpensive and alternative fuel vehicles, and AYRO expects it to become even more competitive in the future. Other suppliers have joined the market for three-wheeled cars, and AYRO expects more rivals to enter the market within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the global LSEV industry, the most competitive firms include HDK Electric Vehicles, Bradshaw Electric Vehicles, Textron Inc., Polaris Industries, Yamaha Motors Co. Ltd., Speedway Electric, Ingersoll Rand, Inc., AGT Electric Automobiles, Bintelli Electric Vehicles, and Ligier Group. The partnership between AYRO and Club Car, an Ingersoll Rand, Inc. division, gives AYRO a decisive strategic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite this fact, many of the other competitors identified above have substantially greater financial, technological, production, marketing, and other resources than AYRO and will devote more resources to designing, creating, processing, shipping, promoting, selling, and supporting their goods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike the AYRO 411 Fleet, which was engineered, designed, and manufactured as a portfolio of hybrid, medium-duty trucks and vans, all of these rivals adapt an existing fossil-fuel driven golf cart to fulfill utility and industrial requirements for an all-electric commercial utility vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO&amp;#39;s cars are slightly more competitive than internal combustion engine vehicles, based on tax, title and license fees, and CO2 emissions. If renewed electricity is used to charge the AYRO vehicles, an increasing practice for most higher education campuses and government facilities, the AYRO 411 Fleet has an estimated 49 percent reduction in operating costs and an approximate 100 percent reduction in CO2 emissions compared to a typical Ford F150 (gasoline) pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The AYRO 311 offers a drastic reduction in running costs and CO2 emissions relative to the Nissan Versa (gasoline) four-cylinder (1.6 liters) sub-compact vehicle. Additionally, the suggested retail price of the AYRO 311&amp;#39;s is $9,999 MSRP. Respectively, Arcimoto and SOLO sector three-wheeled electric cars have starting MSRPs of $19,900 and $15,888. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO&amp;#39;s most closely-matched rival in the LSEV industry is Polaris Gem. Polaris is an LSEV company manufacturing goods designed for applications identical to AYRO&amp;#39;s. Three passenger car models and two utility vehicle models are sold by Gem. The GEM el XD, which is identical to the AYRO 411 fleet, has a lower starting MSRP than the 411 Fleet. However, the GEM el XD will need to be highly modified to meet the standard features of the AYRO 411 Fleet and would surpass the base MSRP of each AYRO 411 Fleet vehicle with such a configuration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to 13 percent more horsepower and a 48 percent improved turning radius, the AYRO 411 fleet has a more significant pickup bed and box room than the GEM el XD. Such features help drivers of the AYRO 411 Fleet to perform maneuvers in smaller spaces than they can use the GEM el XD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In view of the increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, ongoing globalization, and restructuring in the worldwide automotive sector, AYRO expects competition in its industry to intensify in the future. Product quality and features, time for innovation and growth, cost, durability, protection, customer care, and financing terms are factors impacting competitiveness.

The MPA has an initial term of five years beginning on 1 January 2019 and may be renewed by Club Car on 60 days of prior written notice for successive one-year periods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO has also agreed to work with Club Car to develop new products similar to the AYRO 411 Fleet and to upgrade existing products. AYRO has given Club Car the right to initially decline to buy similar commercial utility vehicles produced by AYRO during the MPA era.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO is currently engaged in negotiations with Club Car to create additional goods to be marketed in Europe and Asia by Club Car, but there can be no guarantee that these discussions will succeed. According to the MPA, in the event that AYRO decides to sell 51% or more of its assets or equity interests, AYRO has also given Club Car the right of first refusal, which is exercisable for a period of 45 days following the issuance of the acquisition notice to Club Car by AYRO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://fordauthority.com/2019/08/ford-mobilitys-autonomic-and-ev-maker-ayro-partner-up/#:%7E:text=Autonomic%20and%20a%20company%20called,Mobility%20cloud%20or%20TMC%20platform.&amp;amp;text=Ford%20Mobility%20purchased%20Autonomic%20in,services%20and%20autonomous%20car%20rollout.""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO is creating a technology framework that can be deployed as additional value-add subscriptions directly offered to the end-user on every car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO has collaborated with Autonomic, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford Smart Mobility LLC, in its transportation mobility cloud to gather vehicle health, utilization, and location information (telematics) and deliver purpose-built data back to AYRO, clients, and fleet operators, generating an additional revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The companies plan to create a range of services to enable AYRO&amp;#39;s line of vehicles to be mobile application friendly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a supply chain partnership to provide sub-assembly manufacturing facilities, AYRO partnered with Cenntro Automotive Group, Ltd., which operates a large electric vehicle plant in the automotive district of Hangzhou, China.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cenntro received nineteen percent (19 percent) of AYRO&amp;#39;s common stock through the alliance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of December 31, 2019, Cenntro beneficially owned approximately 13.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The production of the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles is owned by Cenntro and AYRO has been &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;given an exclusive license to import the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles for sale in North America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cenntro is also used for the production of sub-assemblies of AYRO 311. For both the 411 and 311 models, AYRO imports semi-knocked-down vehicle kits from Cenntro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AYRO&amp;#39;s manufacturing plant in Round Rock, Texas, collects the vehicle kits by shipping containers.

Hey everyone and Welcome, my name is Cristian and today I will share with you 10 of the best tips that can start making you money right now

1. Start saving money and INVEST IT

The most important thing is START SAVING MONEY RIGHT NOW AND INVEST IT, don’t spend it on useless things that don’t add value to you. Either knowledge value, net worth value or future prospect value. This is one of the things that I learned the hard way, as I was spending all my money and never saving and investing it, this has cost me a lot of real money and potential money as I have missed out on a lot of things so be sure and learn from other people’s mistakes

2. Number two has a lot to do with number one TRACK YOUR SPENDING AND IMPROVE IT BY REDUCING EXPENSES

You think you are doing everything you can to start saving money? Well you probably aren’t if you are looking at this post. Start tracking all of your expenses by using your credit or debit card for almost every purchase you do and at the end of every month take your time and look over your statements. Are you satisfied with what you see? Are all your expenses really worth it? Are they adding value for you or future value? Probably not… Are you enjoying 10$ coffees when you can make our own at home for 50 cents? Is that brand name clothing or perfume adding value to you? You can easily get really nice clothes and great smelling perfumes for a lot less when not buying brand names. Another good idea is not to do groceries while you are hungry as you are tempted to buy much more food that you don’t actually need and end up wasting it. Do you really need to pay 5$ to play candy crush? I don’t believe so, you can find tons of games for free but wait a minute, why play games when you should try and do something that adds value to your life? Are you buying lottery tickets? Stop that right now, take that money and invest it. This are just a few examples that can improve your spending habits. Take your time every month and track your expense, cut out the stuff you don’t need and you will start feeling a difference very soon.

3. The number 3 tip is Don’t rush just HAVE PATIENCE. I know, you want Lamborghini money in a week with nothing to start from, Yeah, me too but that is not gonna happen. You must learn to have patience and grow your net worth steadily over time, don’t go on Wall street bets and trade options thinking you’ll get rich by next month, that is a recipe for disaster. You might get lucky 1 in 10 thousand times but there are far better ways of making money. So be patient and take your time.  [SCREENSHOT](https://ibb.co/Q6wyg5h)

Moving up to number 4, INVEST IN STOCKS

Here you can see that if you had invested 30 years ago in 1 share of the SP that money would be worth 10 times that amount right now and even adjusted for inflation you would still be up huge [30 years SP](https://ibb.co/47wkSQq). With the annualized Average Return of investment being more than 6% [AVG RETURNS](https://ibb.co/54NpNZQ). Here you can see that you should not try to time the market as it is really hard to predict what is the best time to buy, you should just get into the stock market, you shouldn’t probably dump all your money in one day. But you should be buying into the stock market every time you get paid would be a great thing to do. As being fully invested in the stock market in the past 30 years has return more than 7% annually, while missing just the 3 best days of the stock market every year could see you end up losing money.  [BEING FULLY INVESTED](https://ibb.co/Jnx6vsF)

Don’t know how the stock market goes? No worries number 5 will help you. INVEST IN ETF’s. What are ETFs? ETFs are exchanged traded funds that you can buy just like stocks. They are very similar to index funds but have lower fees usually and you can find ETFs that track pretty much everything. What are Index funds? Index funds are mutual fonds that are managed by professional money managers and represent a theoretical segment of the stock market with the most important ones being the SP500 that tracks the 500 biggest companies listed on the US stock exchange, the Nasdaq Composite which includes almost all the companies that are listed on the Nasdaq stock market or the Nasdaq 100 which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies in the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/xhzzqSf) and the [DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/T1jhmr9) that tracks the stock performance of the 30 larges companies listed in the United States. They all have ETFs that track them, [QQQ](https://ibb.co/JkWYL76) tracks the Nasdaq and also has a dividend yield of 0,56%, [SPY](https://ibb.co/T45kYff) tracks the SP500 and has a dividend yield of 1,6% while [DIA](https://ibb.co/Vwt1nGN) tracks the Dow Jones and has a dividend yield just over 2%. but you can also invest in ETFs that track sectors like [SMH](https://ibb.co/m5vZML4) which tracks the semiconductor sector and still has a dividend yield of more than 1% more than almost any bank is giving right now on savings account and also offer growth. Or if you like the airlines and think that they will return to the value they once have there is a ETF for that also under the ticker [JETS](https://ibb.co/bJYnSrL) or if you like banks [XLF](https://ibb.co/WK4BYb0) is a good ETF for those and you can also invest in real estate with tracking a real estate ETF, one for example is [XLRE](https://ibb.co/TWhbMdC) , there are many ETFs that you can choose from not only these one. And as long as you consistently invest money over time, it is almost guaranteed that your money will increase they’re value.

Number 6. Don’t try and reinvent the wheel, it’s really hard to come up with something new in this era, you should just try and emulate and improve what you see other people are doing that make a lot of money. A great example is just creating YouTube videos, there are a lot of people making YouTube videos out there and earning money they couldn’t have imagined. Or you can simply learn great skills that have high paying jobs, like coding or if that is to hard you should try and run Facebook or Google ads for companies or people, start small, get your local business to hire you, a lot of small business don’t know how to get noticed on social media and may pay a lot of money to get more customers

Let’s move to number 7 on the list guys and that is: Don’t buy new things. Guys I now we all want that brand new Lamborghini but let’s face is… THE WORST, ABSOLUTELTY THE WORST MONEY YOU CAN EVENER Spend is on a brand new car. The value of that drops like a rock the second you drive it off the dealers lot. You should only buy used cars, you can get a lot more value for your money with a car that is just a few years old and even might get lucky and don’t lose that much money if you buy curs that don’t depreciate that quickly. Other things you shouldn’t buy new that also demand a huge premium over they’re value is jewelry but be aware you should still get the things appraised by a certified expert before you spend money on jewelry to avoid getting scammed. You can usually find pretty good deals on luxury jewelry at reputable pawn shop or eBay items that offered guarantees. Also one last thing you should never buy are pets… This will do two great things, one you save a lot of money when adopting a pet and two you will do a great thing for a pet that is looking for a nice welcoming home.

[CAR DEPRECIATION](https://ibb.co/6Fd1Mc0) /

Number 8 on my first 10 tips on how you can make money right now is PAY OFF THAT HIGH INTEREST DEBT

So, one thing that can start making you money right now is paying high interest debt, I know I told you earlier to invest your money into the stock market ASAP but guys… that interest rate is killing you believe me. You should try and pay off that debt as fast as you can especially the Credit Card DEBT. Try to never, but never have debt on your credit card, as they have the highest interest rates on any kind of loans with even [EXCELLENT CREDIT](https://ibb.co/Yc5H9Y5) the lowest annual percentage rate is still 15% while it does depend from bank to bank with the Discover credit card having the lowest interest and Capital One having the highest at over 25%. After you pay this debt you should then focus on personal loans which have the second highest interest rate at about 10% followed by student loans and auto loans. The one debt you shouldn’t necessarily try and pay of as fast as you can are long term fixed mortgages with interest rates being at all time low rates you should probably take advantage right now and refinance your old mortgage at a much lower APR. So my opinion is that if you have high interest rate loans like credit cards, and personal loans you should get rid of that ASAP I would pay off that debt with 80% of the money I can save every month and the rest of 20% I would invest in the stock market but in the case of lower interest rates you should take advantage by the leverage mortgages offer you and you should invest more in the stock market as the annual average return is much higher than your interest rate. [AVG LOAN RATES](https://ibb.co/TRZr5vm) / [CREDIT CARD RATES](https://ibb.co/3BCcvP3) / [LONG TERM LOANS RATES](https://ibb.co/Z8JsSdc)

Number 9 on the list is TRY NEW THINGS, if you haven’t already found your niche, you should probably try as many new things as possible until you find the one that works for you. You should find that thing that you really enjoy and can also add a significant amount to your net worth, you shouldn’t waste your time with jobs or businesses that you don’t enjoy or don’t have the potential to add big to your net worth

And finally number 10. Invest in real estate and rent out.

You should go out and find good real estate deals, you should seek out houses that are undervalued in a nice neighbourhood. Don’t seek houses that require a lot of work to restore, because if you don’t know what you should really do you might end up overspending on the house. You should get leverage on the real estate with mortgage rates being so low right now. Also go out and find good renters as this will bring up a good steady cash flow as a passive income, this also gives you great tax advantages and is a hedge against inflation especially now with all this money being pumped in the world there is a risk of inflation in the future. There are a few cons for real estate investing the main one being that they require more work than just owning stocks but this is a great way to diversify your asset allocation. So, I believe that you should do both as your income allows you, you should try and buy more and more real estate and rent it out as this will make you control a lot of money with really small upfront costs but you should also keep investing in the stock market. You should try and find your own balance as this is highly depended from person to person [REAL ESTATE PRO/CONS](https://ibb.co/fxKjGNp) / [STOCKS vs REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/wQtCQZ4)

Hey guys, thank you for sticking this far and as a reward for sticking this far here is a bonus tip for you

As soon as you turn 18 you should try and get a credit card to build up your credit history. But be very careful don’t go and spend all the money on the credit card and don’t pay it off as this will negatively impact your history. You should try and own at least a couple of great credit cards that offer great benefits use them but as soon as you can pay that thing off every month so you can enjoy getting a great credit history that will help you later in life when you apply for bigger loans like mortgages.

Hey everyone and Welcome, my name is Cristian and today I will share with you 10 of the best tips that can start making you money right now

1. Start saving money and INVEST IT

The most important thing is START SAVING MONEY RIGHT NOW AND INVEST IT, don’t spend it on useless things that don’t add value to you. Either knowledge value, net worth value or future prospect value. This is one of the things that I learned the hard way, as I was spending all my money and never saving and investing it, this has cost me a lot of real money and potential money as I have missed out on a lot of things so be sure and learn from other people’s mistakes

2. Number two has a lot to do with number one TRACK YOUR SPENDING AND IMPROVE IT BY REDUCING EXPENSES

You think you are doing everything you can to start saving money? Well you probably aren’t if you are looking at this post. Start tracking all of your expenses by using your credit or debit card for almost every purchase you do and at the end of every month take your time and look over your statements. Are you satisfied with what you see? Are all your expenses really worth it? Are they adding value for you or future value? Probably not… Are you enjoying 10$ coffees when you can make our own at home for 50 cents? Is that brand name clothing or perfume adding value to you? You can easily get really nice clothes and great smelling perfumes for a lot less when not buying brand names. Another good idea is not to do groceries while you are hungry as you are tempted to buy much more food that you don’t actually need and end up wasting it. Do you really need to pay 5$ to play candy crush? I don’t believe so, you can find tons of games for free but wait a minute, why play games when you should try and do something that adds value to your life? Are you buying lottery tickets? Stop that right now, take that money and invest it. This are just a few examples that can improve your spending habits. Take your time every month and track your expense, cut out the stuff you don’t need and you will start feeling a difference very soon. 

3. The number 3 tip is Don’t rush just HAVE PATIENCE. I know, you want Lamborghini money in a week with nothing to start from, Yeah, me too but that is not gonna happen. You must learn to have patience and grow your net worth steadily over time, don’t go on Wall street bets and trade options thinking you’ll get rich by next month, that is a recipe for disaster. You might get lucky 1 in 10 thousand times but there are far better ways of making money. So be patient and take your time.  [SCREENSHOT](https://ibb.co/Q6wyg5h)

Moving up to number 4, INVEST IN STOCKS

Here you can see that if you had invested 30 years ago in 1 share of the SP that money would be worth 10 times that amount right now and even adjusted for inflation you would still be up huge [30 years SP](https://ibb.co/47wkSQq). With the annualized Average Return of investment being more than 6% [AVG RETURNS](https://ibb.co/54NpNZQ). Here you can see that you should not try to time the market as it is really hard to predict what is the best time to buy, you should just get into the stock market, you shouldn’t probably dump all your money in one day. But you should be buying into the stock market every time you get paid would be a great thing to do. As being fully invested in the stock market in the past 30 years has return more than 7% annually, while missing just the 3 best days of the stock market every year could see you end up losing money.  [BEING FULLY INVESTED](https://ibb.co/Jnx6vsF)

Don’t know how the stock market goes? No worries number 5 will help you. INVEST IN ETF’s. What are ETFs? ETFs are exchanged traded funds that you can buy just like stocks. They are very similar to index funds but have lower fees usually and you can find ETFs that track pretty much everything. What are Index funds? Index funds are mutual fonds that are managed by professional money managers and represent a theoretical segment of the stock market with the most important ones being the SP500 that tracks the 500 biggest companies listed on the US stock exchange, the Nasdaq Composite which includes almost all the companies that are listed on the Nasdaq stock market or the Nasdaq 100 which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies in the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/xhzzqSf) and the [DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/T1jhmr9) that tracks the stock performance of the 30 larges companies listed in the United States. They all have ETFs that track them, [QQQ](https://ibb.co/JkWYL76) tracks the Nasdaq and also has a dividend yield of 0,56%, [SPY](https://ibb.co/T45kYff) tracks the SP500 and has a dividend yield of 1,6% while [DIA](https://ibb.co/Vwt1nGN) tracks the Dow Jones and has a dividend yield just over 2%. but you can also invest in ETFs that track sectors like [SMH](https://ibb.co/m5vZML4) which tracks the semiconductor sector and still has a dividend yield of more than 1% more than almost any bank is giving right now on savings account and also offer growth. Or if you like the airlines and think that they will return to the value they once have there is a ETF for that also under the ticker [JETS](https://ibb.co/bJYnSrL) or if you like banks [XLF](https://ibb.co/WK4BYb0) is a good ETF for those and you can also invest in real estate with tracking a real estate ETF, one for example is [XLRE](https://ibb.co/TWhbMdC) , there are many ETFs that you can choose from not only these one. And as long as you consistently invest money over time, it is almost guaranteed that your money will increase they’re value.

Number 6. Don’t try and reinvent the wheel, it’s really hard to come up with something new in this era, you should just try and emulate and improve what you see other people are doing that make a lot of money. A great example is just creating YouTube videos, there are a lot of people making YouTube videos out there and earning money they couldn’t have imagined. Or you can simply learn great skills that have high paying jobs, like coding or if that is to hard you should try and run Facebook or Google ads for companies or people, start small, get your local business to hire you, a lot of small business don’t know how to get noticed on social media and may pay a lot of money to get more customers

Let’s move to number 7 on the list guys and that is: Don’t buy new things. Guys I now we all want that brand new Lamborghini but let’s face is… THE WORST, ABSOLUTELTY THE WORST MONEY YOU CAN EVENER Spend is on a brand new car. The value of that drops like a rock the second you drive it off the dealers lot. You should only buy used cars, you can get a lot more value for your money with a car that is just a few years old and even might get lucky and don’t lose that much money if you buy curs that don’t depreciate that quickly. Other things you shouldn’t buy new that also demand a huge premium over they’re value is jewelry but be aware you should still get the things appraised by a certified expert before you spend money on jewelry to avoid getting scammed. You can usually find pretty good deals on luxury jewelry at reputable pawn shop or eBay items that offered guarantees. Also one last thing you should never buy are pets… This will do two great things, one you save a lot of money when adopting a pet and two you will do a great thing for a pet that is looking for a nice welcoming home.

[CAR DEPRECIATION](https://ibb.co/6Fd1Mc0) / 

Number 8 on my first 10 tips on how you can make money right now is PAY OFF THAT HIGH INTEREST DEBT

So, one thing that can start making you money right now is paying high interest debt, I know I told you earlier to invest your money into the stock market ASAP but guys… that interest rate is killing you believe me. You should try and pay off that debt as fast as you can especially the Credit Card DEBT. Try to never, but never have debt on your credit card, as they have the highest interest rates on any kind of loans with even [EXCELLENT CREDIT](https://ibb.co/Yc5H9Y5) the lowest annual percentage rate is still 15% while it does depend from bank to bank with the Discover credit card having the lowest interest and Capital One having the highest at over 25%. After you pay this debt you should then focus on personal loans which have the second highest interest rate at about 10% followed by student loans and auto loans. The one debt you shouldn’t necessarily try and pay of as fast as you can are long term fixed mortgages with interest rates being at all time low rates you should probably take advantage right now and refinance your old mortgage at a much lower APR. So my opinion is that if you have high interest rate loans like credit cards, and personal loans you should get rid of that ASAP I would pay off that debt with 80% of the money I can save every month and the rest of 20% I would invest in the stock market but in the case of lower interest rates you should take advantage by the leverage mortgages offer you and you should invest more in the stock market as the annual average return is much higher than your interest rate. [AVG LOAN RATES](https://ibb.co/TRZr5vm) / [CREDIT CARD RATES](https://ibb.co/3BCcvP3) / [LONG TERM LOANS RATES](https://ibb.co/Z8JsSdc)

Number 9 on the list is TRY NEW THINGS, if you haven’t already found your niche, you should probably try as many new things as possible until you find the one that works for you. You should find that thing that you really enjoy and can also add a significant amount to your net worth, you shouldn’t waste your time with jobs or businesses that you don’t enjoy or don’t have the potential to add big to your net worth

And finally number 10. Invest in real estate and rent out.

You should go out and find good real estate deals, you should seek out houses that are undervalued in a nice neighbourhood. Don’t seek houses that require a lot of work to restore, because if you don’t know what you should really do you might end up overspending on the house. You should get leverage on the real estate with mortgage rates being so low right now. Also go out and find good renters as this will bring up a good steady cash flow as a passive income, this also gives you great tax advantages and is a hedge against inflation especially now with all this money being pumped in the world there is a risk of inflation in the future. There are a few cons for real estate investing the main one being that they require more work than just owning stocks but this is a great way to diversify your asset allocation. So, I believe that you should do both as your income allows you, you should try and buy more and more real estate and rent it out as this will make you control a lot of money with really small upfront costs but you should also keep investing in the stock market. You should try and find your own balance as this is highly depended from person to person [REAL ESTATE PRO/CONS](https://ibb.co/fxKjGNp) / [STOCKS vs REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/wQtCQZ4)

Hey guys, thank you for sticking this far and as a reward for sticking this far here is a bonus tip for you

As soon as you turn 18 you should try and get a credit card to build up your credit history. But be very careful don’t go and spend all the money on the credit card and don’t pay it off as this will negatively impact your history. You should try and own at least a couple of great credit cards that offer great benefits use them but as soon as you can pay that thing off every month so you can enjoy getting a great credit history that will help you later in life when you apply for bigger loans like mortgages.

Hi community!

Those who do not know, before the Madoff ponzi collapsed, B. Madoff was chairman of Nasdaq and very well respected among the circles. Few years later, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $18 billion. It is reason why i am posting this as hopefully i will save few people from losing their money in the coming years by investing into cryptocurrencies.

I will keep it short and simple and not go much into technical details, but i assure you anyone willing to google, there is plenty of detailed proof and research into the topic.

Bitcoin price has increased through this year **mainly** only because the fact that there is a mechanism in which dollar ""equivalent"", called tether, which is almost entirely unpacked by fiat (unofficial claim by tether treasury is, that they are packed by dollar equivalent, which in this case means bitcoin itself, which is ridiculous in itself), is being used to prop up the price of bitcoin by buying it off all the major exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, Coinbase, Kraken etc. There is hardly any real retail interest and all the major counter points, used by the crypto community (such as insitutional demand, billionaires buying before you, Paypal, Square, Micro etc) is all smoke and mirrors, in hopes that retail will come and buy into the ponzi pyramid.

Why i mentioned Madoff, is because just few days back, total tether in circulation also crossed the SIPC mentioned $18B, currently already at $18.4B. This year alone so called Tether Treasury has issued &gt;14B new tethers, claiming exponential increase in demand. As a comparison, at the peak of the 2017 crypto mania, there were only total of 1.4B printed through whole year. And tether is only one of the quite a few noteworthy other stablecoins, which i wont go into currently, but they also feed into the loop/system, of proping up the price. Simple example being DEFI, where Ethereum is being used as an collateral, for person to take out a loan in so called stable coins, which then on majority of cases, is used again to purchase even more ethereum. In Laymans terms, being used as a simple leverage multiplier tool with interest payment. But is defined by community, as somewhat of a groundbreaking new invention. Which i agree, it somewhat would be, if used for the real world purposes, not as a simple leverage tool.

Here is a chart i put together, which should make it rather obvious for anyone taking a quick look.

It includes last 4 years of bitcoin price, tether printing and retail interest on one chart:

I will also leave you with a comic strip, that i had made, which describes the last 4 years of Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency asset class) tether addiction:

PS *I just want to add, that in my opinion, main issue with bitcoin and all of cryptocurrency space is more precisely what it has become, a big ponzi pyramid. On top of that, tether treasury (and those involved) has completely taken over the space and what they are doing, will eventually leave many people financially ruined (because they do not any better or know, but still are willing to risk) and unfortunately them probably much more rich.*

*I must add, that i would be significantly more acceptable with this global huge economy project/test, if it would lead its way in natural course, without middleman mafia, which currently, in Laymans terms, pumps the price with nothing but air, to eventually sell to a greater fool. If it would naturally succeed, as in new age gold 2.0, more gradually, actually being implemented into payment/financial systems etc, actually represent the alternative to government money, money for people, i would be alot more comfortable to let it run its course and see if it perhaps succeeds.*

*Bitcoin has lost all of what it was supposed to represent and where it was supposed to develop as a technology. There are many reasons why it has gone as such, it is not really topic to discuss here.*",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,565873,public,confidence,self,Bernie Madoff and bitcoin,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jylc71/bernie_madoff_and_bitcoin/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these are the stocks i have invested in: 

ENPH (up 84%) 

NET ( up 70%)

ICLN ( up 33%) my biggest holding by far (gift from my dad)

ARKF ( up 7%)

IBDRY (up 7%)

AMD ( up .40%)

&amp;#x200B;

I bought alot most of these late august, and since then they have exploded. my question is, most of these stocks seem overvalued right, now, so would it make sense buying more shares at these heavily inflated prices?

&amp;#x200B;

the reason i have not bought a vanguard index ETF is cause alot of them are quite expensive for the money i have on hand.

The article is titled ""3 Quantum Glass Stocks for the Future of Batteries.""

https://investorplace.com/2020/11/3-quantum-glass-stocks-for-the-future-of-batteries-ssnlf-pcrfy-kcac/

The three picks are Samsung, Panasonic, and QuantumScape.  I'll focus on the third, the **electric vehicle battery supplier backed by Volkswagen and even Bill Gates himself**.  Past discussions can be found here:

[Bill Gates-backed Electric Vehicle battery supplier, QuantumScape, to ""IPO"" (QS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ja0oq3/bill_gatesbacked_electric_vehicle_battery/)

The ticker QS will come live in just a week's time.

Anyways, on to to relevant quotes from Farooque's article:

&gt; Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY)-backed QuantumScape, a manufacturer of large-capacity solid-state lithium-metal batteries. Volkswagen will use the company exclusively for its EV needs. Being the European EV market leader, the fastest-growing EV market on the planet should be reason enough for you to be bullish.

&gt; However, it would help if you were patient with this stock. All of the parties involved said they have enough funds to back its ambitions. But the issue is cost-effectiveness and managing demand. Since we are dealing with experimental technology, those issues can be resolved in due time.

Since this summer I see more and more people on YouTube, Reddit and on other platforms that talk about Dropbox as If it is the next great tech darling. I like DBX and I think it will do well, but I doubt it will quadrouple in the next 5 years as some suggest.

Also, what is odd is the fact that 1) the pandemic did not propell this stock and 2) even though all these social media gurus talk about it and pump it, the stock fell which I believe is just short term impacience from traders and hype.

Here are my thoughts:

Talking valuations is has a sub 20 forward PE and recently started getting profitable. The market cap is just around 8b. Share price 19$.

Financials. It's short term assets cover is short and long term liabilities. No debt. And a future buyback program. Positive FCF.

Product. I use dropbox at work and at home with my family and I really like the fact that it's UI is easy to understand and use, when comparing it to OneDrive and GoogleDrive. So, user growth+ a nice product which is expanding into smart workspace, not just cloud storage. Also, they bought hellosign, which could be second to DocuSign in the digital signature space. 

When glancing who owns DBX shares, we can see really large funds like vanguard, black rock and the rennaisance group. Also insiders hold 30 percent of the company and they did not sell any shares recently. One co-founder is still actively with the company and is the CEO for 13 yrs. I love it when founders stay and fight for the company, it gives the company credibility.

Possible tailwinds: included into NASDAQ 100 and S&amp;P500. Smart workspace makes a big difference and people accelerate to it's products. Hellosign gets a DocuSign type valuation. A big fund actively promotes the company.

The risks: google or microsoft focus more on smart workspace and kill dbx product by underpricing. Extending into smart workspace fails and it kills their financials.
Pretty large shareholder dillution in the past. So that growth/dillution is not that great.
CEO and co-founder leaves the company
Meh expected revenue growth of 8.5% in the future.


Based on the fcf to equity discounting that many people use for the company, and a discount ratio of 8%, a growth ratio of 2.2%(5yr us bond), the share price should be around 23$ now. Price target 2025 40$.

# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.
*****
&gt; “On the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. ‘People: Don’t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,’” said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.
*****
&gt; Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.
*****
&gt; “I think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it’s going to go on for a couple of days,” Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. “The cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,” Lee said.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the “winter will be grim” and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.
*****
&gt; “It’s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,” said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. “This is happening and with exponential force right now. It’s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.”
*****
&gt; But Nixon said she’s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.
*****
&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.
*****
&gt; The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed’s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.
*****
&gt; The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.
*****
&gt; Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.
*****
&gt; Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.
*****
&gt; “The biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,” Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.
*****
&gt; She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn’t get in on time. “Value has so much to go to catch up on growth,” she said.

&gt; # The Thanksgiving Trade

&gt; Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the “holiday spirit.” First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964.

&gt; Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece’s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018’s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b5ce4af9292059c4d14b95baeef02b2c/d8ddf7af01919e17-07/s1280x1920/c4a8ff5b8e431b28dd3e24654e98204861afd94d.jpg))**

&gt; Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&amp;P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&amp;P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.

&gt; # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar

&gt; First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). “The miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs—yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn’t been called officially.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn’t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; After Monday’s record close, the S&amp;P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.

&gt; Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average—another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow

&gt; The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.

&gt; Breadth in this month’s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That’s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.

&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

&gt; # Finally A New High for Small Caps

&gt; It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**

&gt; The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # A Month for the Ages

&gt; Just when you think you've seen it all from this market, a month like November comes around. Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.

&gt; In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**

&gt; In the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**

&gt; While just about every stock in the S&amp;P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&amp;P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.

&gt; # Long Term Averages Taken Out

&gt; With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.

&gt; As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.

&gt; In the table below, we show a list of the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.

&gt; # Stocks Flying Around the Globe

&gt; Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.

&gt; Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.

Stocks fell Friday with market participants concerned at the lack of fiscal stimulus and the surge in coronavirus the last three weeks will make states reimpose restrictions that threaten to stall business activity in an already tenuous economy. An apparent dispute between the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve also weighed on the minds of market participants.

In Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said during a press conference that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-KY) agreed to pick back up stimulus negotiations. However, given the tenuous political situation surrounding the presidential election and the gridlock that exists in the Senate (majority for the Senate is still undecided), it is highly unlikely that any form of stimulus is passed. For months, Congress and the White House went back and forth regarding stimulus but were unable to come to an agreement. In our opinion, it is highly unlikely that additional fiscal stimulus is granted until the presidential and senate elections are resolved conclusively.

Unfortunately, the surge in coronavirus cases shows no signs of slowing down. Yesterday, the US once again set another record high for new infections, hospitalizations. According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, there were 187,800 new cases. That’s up 27% compared to last week and by far the most since the pandemic began. Data is trending in the wrong direction, with 44 out of 50 states reporting a 10% increase in new cases compared to last week. According to the COVID Tracking Project, there are around 80,700 people hospitalized with coronavirus in the US, also a new record. That’s an increase of 19.13% compared to last week. Saddest of all, there were more than 2,000 deaths due to the virus yesterday, the highest number since early May, according to Johns Hopkins University. 

In an effort to combat the surge in cases, governors from both sides of the aisle have announced a variety of new restrictions. California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is “pulling the emergency brake” on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as ""feel-good"" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. Illinois**,** Michigan, and New Jersey announced additional restrictions that limit gatherings to household members. Indoor event spaces are also being ordered to shut-down or move outdoors. In Massachusetts, the governor announced a stay-at-home advisory. Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota are under state-wide mask mandate. These are just some of the examples, there are too many examples to list.

Despite the positive vaccine news from companies like Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) it is important to note that it takes time to establish global distribution networks. Widespread availability of a vaccine likely won’t happen until 2021, according to the estimates of experts. In the short-term, the surge in coronavirus cases and the fear of new restriction is driving volatility.

**Highlights**

* Had a great day, closed out our BABA alert for 100% this morning.

Just copied this from a member on another board, some asked me on Reddit about the supplement line and I gave a vague answer based off what I remembered from the article, this is worded and simplified a little better.

CYBIN has the rights to AHCC. It will be a staple in the nutraceutical line soon to be released. Worded simply it is basically a fairly potent immune system booster. People should understand that the AHCC formulation rights are a BIG deal.

Play-byPlay. I'm sorry. I have meetings. But will try to update as I can.\n\n**11/20 Possibilities**\n\nSPY is nearing the bottom of the downtrend. If support holds and she crosses 354.89, I may scalp a 0dte call and look at trimming or taking profit at 357.68 (the top from yesterday). I may leave a runner to see if she can get to 357.94 and break out of the downward channel and look at exiting at around 358.91 - 359.77\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mpyrcd0hyf061.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e7cad866d9ba13717aa26093e30542cd3004619\n\nIf SPY holds current support and bounces, we could be in a bullish symmetrical triangle with a price target around 370.36 within the next three trading days. Look at a price break of 358.91 and 363.13 ish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14qq989kyf061.png?width=1872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c8f56eaebfe699988399094617194fa2971bfb6\n\nA hopeful indication that we could get to that point is if SPY recovers from yesterday's AH dump. If we jump out of the mini-bull flag formed from yesterday and recover back to yesterday's top, I'll look at a call for next week, expiring on Wednesday. 366c is what I may look at. Look at that pretty mini-cup and handle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzk4ta2nyf061.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21b9b80982813894008e04498a7940a45457d4e4\n\nIf SPY can hold support of 354, and she bottoms out at 351.31 ish we could see a bearish descending triangle begin to form. However, for this pattern to be viable, SPY needs to bounce off resistance at 358.21 and break support at 351.31. If she breaks support, we could see a downwards price target of 339.51 within the next 4 trading days. This would put us near the edge of the large bear flag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/34bho3dryf061.png?width=1874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=640912d2ed56abc18d79e9384ed1e77ba5f89f44\n\nThe large rounding  top is still in play that was drawn yesterday. Here’s a snippet from yesterday: “If SPY hits resistance at that level and falls back down to support, we might be in a hidden rounding top. Again, SPY needs to break 351.31 or its “neckline” for this pattern to be viable.”  If she breaks the neckline we could see the downward price of 339 or near the edge of the bear flag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jaf07qrtyf061.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a27100fed8372f7cf7c8cbc91b464eefc54cce8\n\nAs stated in earlier projections, anything below 358.91 and I’m a bear. Currently, we have found resistance at that level and are now looking downwards. If we drop to 339 ish we may have hit a triple top pattern. But for this pattern to complete, SPY needs to break the neckline of 330.21 ish. If that happens we could see a price target of around 310-292 ish. For my country's sake, I hope we don’t get there. But if we do, may we all make money.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ml87knwvyf061.png?width=1870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a79b3dfd972f4d457855904f1463a634cf49fac1\n\nLastly, as stated in earlier projections, SPY needs to make its way back up to 358.91 - 363.28 - 366.42 for the w-shape recovery to still be in play. For the pattern to be viable, it needs to break out 2-3% from 366.42, and then we could see upwards of 390 (ish).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1zhjmjnxyf061.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19c8b51a761e520bcce5c26cc14772fab2836e34\n\n**11/19 Recap**\n\nSPY was pretty uneventful for most of the day. She consolidated into lunch until she decided to pump. She went back into consolidation at the top, waiting for the COVID Taskforce news brief after hours. As you can see, the news was pretty gloomy, and we didn't receive any NEW vaccine news, to my knowledge.\n\nHere's a link to a recap: [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/19/world/covid-19-coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/19/world/covid-19-coronavirus)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps216u0zf061.png?width=1874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b61ee944881153a272b2dcc5477b7623febcf8a9\n\nI was studying the chart AH while watching the press conference and thought it would be fun to conduct some real time analysis in a discord that I belong to. We formed a nice rounding top with that initial dump AH. Here’s the last snippet: “...but usually with a rounding top, if it holds, downwards of 355.38 (ish)”.\n\nAs of 4:26 AM MST, SPY is at 354.88.\n\nHere's a link to the chart mentioned in the screenshot below: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/5QNvHAop/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5QNvHAop/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a1e71es5zf061.png?width=1872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1103fb1ceabd3712aed92f93af4dcb6f4ff3c6f1\n\nThanks for reading.

[FUTURES](https://ibb.co/sFPq0sm) / [STIMULUS NEWS](https://ibb.co/xD0Qvzt)

The VIX continued to remain steady and remains in the clear downtrend started at the end of September as it dropped more than 3% again yesterday. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/q5tFDtr) [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/LkF9ypR)

This is not such a big thing in context as this programs have only accounted for about 25 billion$ in lending. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/tCzg4t7)

There was a pretty even distribution of growth in all of the sectors yesterday as only utilities finished in the red with large-cap value companies being the laggards of the stock market. [CHART](https://ibb.co/vPXgVJM) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/smy0dhn)

Here is the heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/3s4c3tg) from yesterday as the big tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft finally turned positive and led the stock market higher as this companies account for about 20% of the SP500, this is not the first time that the index has been dominated by just a few players, as 40 years ago IBM, AT&amp;T, Exxon and GM made up for about 19% of the index. Though Tesla is soon joining the biggest player in the SP as they will account for about 1,3% of the index when they will be added this December.

Yesterday was the first time in more than a month that the initial jobless claims came in higher than the previous week as 742 thousand people filed for benefits, this was up more than 30k from the previous week and well above the 707 thousand forecasted. This is still more than 3 times higher than pre-pandemic numbers Though better data came in from the continuing claims as they fell to 6,37 million, a number lower than the previous week of 6,8 million and lower than what was forecasted at almost 6,5 million. [JOBLESS CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/521qtyd)

While better numbers came in as the existing home sales saw a huge spike of more than 4% as they continued to rise for a fifth straight month as the Philly fed outlook also came in well above the expectations. [FED OUTLOOK](https://ibb.co/HpWKHj2) / [HOME SALES](https://ibb.co/0YyqjWm)

The stock market may see another great moment when the European Union might approve the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna in the next month as well. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/8KjgNyR)

Also, today it is expected that Georgia will formally certify Biden’s victory, as this will pretty much put an end to Trump’s legal fights and will bring more stability to the economic policy expectations for the future. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/m5fYKcQ)

Some stock market companies news came in as We saw Roku yesterday hitting new all-time highs as even bearish players start to notice the huge tailwind and boost the pandemic has given to a lot of companies. Roku rose more than 10% yesterday after this news and continues to keep growing as the decline in traditional TV continues to go on while they are also close to brining HBO Max directly to they’re platform.

I believe there are a lot of great opportunities to buy Stocks right now as I believe companies like PayPal, Roku, Amazon, Tesla, Target and many more still have room to run by the end of the year. In the coming days I will post my new portfolio composition and targets and I will get a little more on why I chose to buy those companies.

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the Nasdaq composite

[FUTURES](https://ibb.co/sFPq0sm) / [STIMULUS NEWS](https://ibb.co/xD0Qvzt)

The VIX continued to remain steady and remains in the clear downtrend started at the end of September as it dropped more than 3% again yesterday. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/q5tFDtr) [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/LkF9ypR)

We saw more than 60% of the companies advancing on way below volume average as investors  [CHART](https://ibb.co/kh4BLQX) are waiting to see what the next days and weeks brings us, as Pfizer is expected to apply for the FDA authorization today  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/w6MQ4Tp) while huge uncertainty remains with the big spike in cases of COVID-19 in the US and a fiscal policy that remains uncertain until the change in Presidency. as yesterday the treasury declined to extend 5 of the FED’s cares act emergency programs that expire at the end of the year with the most important ones being: the main street lending facility, the corporate bond purchases and the municipal bond purchases. This is not such a big thing in context as this programs have only accounted for about 25 billion$ in lending. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/tCzg4t7)

There was a pretty even distribution of growth in all of the sectors yesterday as only utilities finished in the red with large-cap value companies being the laggards of the stock market. [CHART](https://ibb.co/vPXgVJM) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/smy0dhn)

Here is the heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/3s4c3tg) from yesterday as the big tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft finally turned positive and led the stock market higher as this companies account for about 20% of the SP500, this is not the first time that the index has been dominated by just a few players, as 40 years ago IBM, AT&amp;T, Exxon and GM made up for about 19% of the index. Though Tesla is soon joining the biggest player in the SP as they will account for about 1,3% of the index when they will be added this December. [SP HISTORY](https://ibb.co/rM846BS) / [SP FUTURE](https://ibb.co/wZnGQq3)

Yesterday was the first time in more than a month that the initial jobless claims came in higher than the previous week as 742 thousand people filed for benefits, this was up more than 30k from the previous week and well above the 707 thousand forecasted. This is still more than 3 times higher than pre-pandemic numbers Though better data came in from the continuing claims as they fell to 6,37 million, a number lower than the previous week of 6,8 million and lower than what was forecasted at almost 6,5 million. [JOBLESS CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/521qtyd)

While better numbers came in as the existing home sales saw a huge spike of more than 4% as they continued to rise for a fifth straight month as the Philly fed outlook also came in well above the expectations. [FED OUTLOOK](https://ibb.co/HpWKHj2) / [HOME SALES](https://ibb.co/0YyqjWm)

The stock market may see another great moment when the European Union might approve the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna in the next month as well. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/8KjgNyR)

Also, today it is expected that Georgia will formally certify Biden’s victory, as this will pretty much put an end to Trump’s legal fights and will bring more stability to the economic policy expectations for the future. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/m5fYKcQ)

Some stock market companies news came in as We saw Roku yesterday hitting new all-time highs as even bearish players start to notice the huge tailwind and boost the pandemic has given to a lot of companies. Roku rose more than 10% yesterday after this news and continues to keep growing as the decline in traditional TV continues to go on while they are also close to brining HBO Max directly to they’re platform. [ROKU - HBO](https://ibb.co/txyH21M) / [ROKU UPGRADE](https://ibb.co/kqcpH93)

And as dividends go, PEPSICO and Home Depot just announced quarterly dividends with yields in line with previous.  [HD DIVIDEND](https://ibb.co/yqyTr16) / [PEPSICO DIVIDEND](https://ibb.co/1LShBhm)

I believe there are a lot of great opportunities to buy Stocks right now as I believe companies like PayPal, Roku, Amazon, Tesla, Target and many more still have room to run by the end of the year. In the coming days I will post my new portfolio composition and targets and I will get a little more on why I chose to buy those companies.

Possibilities Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/jwtaqw/1118_spy_recap_and_some_possibilities_or_i_hope/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n\\*\\*NO 30 min. Play-byPlay. I\'m sorry. I have meetings. But will try to update as I can.\n\n**11/20 Possibilities**\n\nSPY is nearing the bottom of the downtrend. If support holds and she crosses 354.89, I may scalp a 0dte call and look at trimming or taking profit at 357.68 (the top from yesterday). I may leave a runner to see if she can get to 357.94 and break out of the downward channel and look at exiting at around 358.91 - 359.77\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/djypbs5t1e061.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=035f85c09f95c2be9722efe5665508e6627850da\n\nIf SPY holds current support and bounces, we could be in a bullish symmetrical triangle with a price target around 370.36 within the next three trading days. Look at a price break of 358.91 and 363.13 ish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xttgo53y1e061.png?width=1872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54cad82075902e8562f54c8a5996d89ea6e9471\n\nA hopeful indication that we could get to that point is if SPY recovers from yesterday\'s AH dump. If we jump out of the mini-bull flag formed from yesterday and recover back to yesterday\'s top, I\'ll look at a call for next week, expiring on Wednesday. 366c is what I may look at. Look at that pretty mini-cup and handle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9aox19c22e061.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=855ef9e171697b5098b3d68848ce6a8c64555def\n\nIf SPY can hold support of 354, and she bottoms out at 351.31 ish we could see a bearish descending triangle begin to form. However, for this pattern to be viable, SPY needs to bounce off resistance at 358.21 and break support at 351.31. If she breaks support, we could see a downwards price target of 339.51 within the next 4 trading days. This would put us near the edge of the large bear flag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0c7yue62e061.png?width=1874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3496d4738c2dc310316bae09fb76d78b15fee06c\n\nThe large rounding  top is still in play that was drawn yesterday. Here’s a snippet from yesterday: “If SPY hits resistance at that level and falls back down to support, we might be in a hidden rounding top. Again, SPY needs to break 351.31 or its “neckline” for this pattern to be viable.”  If she breaks the neckline we could see the downward price of 339 or near the edge of the bear flag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xnrxerea2e061.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6403f8bfd271cbd3859a7ae9e5dbb107017850fe\n\nAs stated in earlier projections, anything below 358.91 and I’m a bear. Currently, we have found resistance at that level and are now looking downwards. If we drop to 339 ish we may have hit a triple top pattern. But for this pattern to complete, SPY needs to break the neckline of 330.21 ish. If that happens we could see a price target of around 310-292 ish. For my country\'s sake, I hope we don’t get there. But if we do, may we all make money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a95tcfef2e061.png?width=1870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14844e753ca9cd4a2cfb27e41659b120c2687fe5\n\nLastly, as stated in earlier projections, SPY needs to make its way back up to 358.91 - 363.28 - 366.42 for the w-shape recovery to still be in play. For the pattern to be viable, it needs to break out 2-3% from 366.42, and then we could see upwards of 390 (ish).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlosv95j2e061.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1feb96477acfe761a207849641640e90f9c8dadf\n\n**11/19 Recap**\n\nSPY was pretty uneventful for most of the day. She consolidated into lunch until she decided to pump. She went back into consolidation at the top, waiting for the COVID Taskforce news brief after hours. As you can see, the news was pretty gloomy, and we didn\'t receive any NEW vaccine news, to my knowledge.\n\nHere\'s a link to a recap: [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/19/world/covid-19-coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/19/world/covid-19-coronavirus)\n\n![img](nudytgzo2e061 ""\n"")\n\nI was studying the chart AH while watching the press conference and thought it would be fun to conduct some real time analysis in a discord that I belong to. We formed a nice rounding top with that initial dump AH. Here’s the last snippet: “...but usually with a rounding top, if it holds, downwards of 355.38 (ish)”.\n\nAs of 4:26 AM MST, SPY is at 354.88.\n\nHere\'s a link to the chart mentioned in the screenshot below: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/5QNvHAop/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5QNvHAop/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73qewfbt2e061.png?width=1872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29c39b2aa40139be8983c9a00f654b197c5feef9\n\nSPY still has ways to drop to for a doom scenario possibility as charted below. We are about 15 points away from the 339 rising bear flag support. However, for my chart, if we cross 351, I will start looking at some Dec. puts but will not buy until we edge closer to 339.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d5tnf4y2e061.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=374bc76f27e77b7c3bd939f4b9b84dfdb10ca4a3\n\nTHanks for reading.

If support holds and she crosses 354.89, I may scalp a 0dte call and look at trimming or taking profit at 357.68 (the top from yesterday). I may leave a runner to see if she can get to 357.94 and break out of the downward channel and look at exiting at around 358.91 - 359.77&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/djypbs5t1e061.png?width=1876&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=035f85c09f95c2be9722efe5665508e6627850da""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/djypbs5t1e061.png?width=1876&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=035f85c09f95c2be9722efe5665508e6627850da&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If SPY holds current support and bounces, we could be in a bullish symmetrical triangle with a price target around 370.36 within the next three trading days. Look at a price break of 358.91 and 363.13 ish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/xttgo53y1e061.png?width=1872&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b54cad82075902e8562f54c8a5996d89ea6e9471""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xttgo53y1e061.png?width=1872&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b54cad82075902e8562f54c8a5996d89ea6e9471&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A hopeful indication that we could get to that point is if SPY recovers from yesterday&amp;#39;s AH dump. If we jump out of the mini-bull flag formed from yesterday and recover back to yesterday&amp;#39;s top, I&amp;#39;ll look at a call for next week, expiring on Wednesday. 366c is what I may look at. Look at that pretty mini-cup and handle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/9aox19c22e061.png?width=1876&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=855ef9e171697b5098b3d68848ce6a8c64555def""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9aox19c22e061.png?width=1876&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=855ef9e171697b5098b3d68848ce6a8c64555def&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If SPY can hold support of 354, and she bottoms out at 351.31 ish we could see a bearish descending triangle begin to form. However, for this pattern to be viable, SPY needs to bounce off resistance at 358.21 and break support at 351.31. If she breaks support, we could see a downwards price target of 339.51 within the next 4 trading days. This would put us near the edge of the large bear flag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/u0c7yue62e061.png?width=1874&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3496d4738c2dc310316bae09fb76d78b15fee06c""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/u0c7yue62e061.png?width=1874&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3496d4738c2dc310316bae09fb76d78b15fee06c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The large rounding  top is still in play that was drawn yesterday. Here’s a snippet from yesterday: “If SPY hits resistance at that level and falls back down to support, we might be in a hidden rounding top. Again, SPY needs to break 351.31 or its “neckline” for this pattern to be viable.”  If she breaks the neckline we could see the downward price of 339 or near the edge of the bear flag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/xnrxerea2e061.png?width=1538&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6403f8bfd271cbd3859a7ae9e5dbb107017850fe""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xnrxerea2e061.png?width=1538&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6403f8bfd271cbd3859a7ae9e5dbb107017850fe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As stated in earlier projections, anything below 358.91 and I’m a bear. Currently, we have found resistance at that level and are now looking downwards. If we drop to 339 ish we may have hit a triple top pattern. But for this pattern to complete, SPY needs to break the neckline of 330.21 ish. If that happens we could see a price target of around 310-292 ish. For my country&amp;#39;s sake, I hope we don’t get there. But if we do, may we all make money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/a95tcfef2e061.png?width=1870&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=14844e753ca9cd4a2cfb27e41659b120c2687fe5""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/a95tcfef2e061.png?width=1870&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=14844e753ca9cd4a2cfb27e41659b120c2687fe5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, as stated in earlier projections, SPY needs to make its way back up to 358.91 - 363.28 - 366.42 for the w-shape recovery to still be in play. For the pattern to be viable, it needs to break out 2-3% from 366.42, and then we could see upwards of 390 (ish).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/vlosv95j2e061.png?width=1320&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1feb96477acfe761a207849641640e90f9c8dadf""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vlosv95j2e061.png?width=1320&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1feb96477acfe761a207849641640e90f9c8dadf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11/19 Recap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SPY was pretty uneventful for most of the day. She consolidated into lunch until she decided to pump. She went back into consolidation at the top, waiting for the COVID Taskforce news brief after hours. As you can see, the news was pretty gloomy, and we didn&amp;#39;t receive any NEW vaccine news, to my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a link to a recap: &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/19/world/covid-19-coronavirus""&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/19/world/covid-19-coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;![img](nudytgzo2e061 &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was studying the chart AH while watching the press conference and thought it would be fun to conduct some real time analysis in a discord that I belong to.

### Market Notes:

After a decent sell-off on Wednesday, the markets made small gains yesterday. Markets are near flat at writing and still below critical resistance.

Friday's have been a bit funky this year and not as optimistic as years past. The pandemic has left a lot of uncertainty in the markets. Investors have grown hesitant to hold risk over the weekend.

Markets are essentially moving sideways. I'll be cautious today. No big risks.

1. First US factory announcement coming before the end of November.
2. Opening of their first six retail locations by next Thursday.
3. Deliveries commencing Q1 of 2021, in line with Biden's inauguration.

Interested in hearing others' thoughts on this company. I know the cars aren't the most attractive, but I believe they address a void for anyone from solo tourists to fleet employees, particularly in Europe where the streets are more narrow. Also timely that they're coming to market in a year where many will be hesitant to commute with others.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished modestly red for the third straight day with market participants closely monitoring rising coronavirus cases in the US and the reimposition of virus restrictions across many states. Despite the positive vaccine news coming out, it will still take some time to establish a global vaccine distribution network.

Unfortunately, yesterday the United States passed the grim milestone of 250,000 deaths from coronavirus. The death toll surpasses the White House’s worst-case prediction from the Spring ([https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-many-240-000-americans/5100446002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-many-240-000-americans/5100446002/)) and is predicted to keep rising with the surge of infections and hospitalizations in the last two weeks. According to Johns Hopkins University, the US is averaging a record 161,165 new infections a day in the last seven days. That’s up 27% compared to last week and by far the most since the pandemic began. Data is trending in the wrong directions, with 44 out of 50 states reporting a 10% increase in new cases compared to last week. 

In response to the surge in cases, governors from both sides of the aisle have announced a variety of new restrictions. California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is “pulling the emergency brake” on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as ""feel-good"" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. Illinois**,** Michigan, and New Jersey announced additional restrictions that limit gatherings to household members. Indoor event spaces are also being ordered to shut-down or move outdoors. In Massachusetts, the governor announced a stay-at-home advisory. Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota are under state-wide mask mandate. These are just some examples, there are many more. 

The Labor Department released its weekly jobs report. Another 742,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, an unexpected rise compared to the 711,000 reported last week as coronavirus cases continue to surge.

* 742,000 new claims vs 700,000 estimate
* Continuing claims,  which is the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, was 6.4 million, equal to the estimate.

Despite the positive vaccine data from Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), setting up an efficient, global vaccine distribution network will likely take months, even after the vaccines are approved. In the short-term, we expect the worsening pandemic and uncertainty surrounding additional fiscal stimulus will likely drive volatility in the short-term.

Ive been keeping my eye on this company for the last few months when I learned that they were partnering with EV companies...earnings were solid, stock price has been steadily going up on low volume the last few days, suddenly yesterday we had a high volume day. Also, there has been a steady stream of good news.

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, I am pretty bullish here after reading up on them and their future plans. Today I read that they are thinking about selling their intellectual property related to their smartphone business to focus soley on cyber security which would net them around half a billion if true. The CEO also seems like a pretty smart guy as he has worked to turn this company around. It sits at around a 50% institutional hold and the charts looking pretty nice lately.

Liberty Media Chairman John Malone told CNBC that global streaming platforms like Amazon and Apple are providing “extremely high quality services” and meeting consumer needs.

He also said that Roku, which aggregates content on its platform, is well-positioned for growth in the long run.

The billionaire media magnate believes that it’s hard for the cable industry to catch up with other big direct consumer players that are expanding globally in a rapid fashion.

While it has not made its way into the economy yet, the impetus of economic growth could make banks more open to lending and people spending their savings; leading to higher money velocity and higher inflation. Fiscal stimulus to combat the slowdown could over reach and cause a spending spree by putting the money directly into the hands of individual who will spend it rather than banks who have been reluctant to lend. \n\n\\- Reasons against inflation: Usually there is deflation historically after recessions due to lack of demand.

Apple announces tax cuts for its app store while big retailers like Lowe’s and Target released earnings yesterday, so let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as all 3 big indexes finished in the red with the Nasdaq droping 0,8% despite hovering above positive for a good part of the day while both the SP500 and the Dow Jones finished down 1,16% also with a big sell off at the end of the trading. This after the Mayor of New York announced that the city will once again switch schools to online due to them having reached a 3% testing positivity rate on a 7day moving average scale. The volatility index saw a small spike after dropping constantly in the last weeks but is still in a clear downtrend from the highs of November.

Here is the heat map from yesterday and it’s clear that is though to find and bright spots in the stock market, with small exceptions like TESLA which continue to have great momentum with the SP500 tailwind still pushing the company, while Zoom jumped in the green after the New York news. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/JQ7cz65)

Over 60% of the companies were declining on below average volume yesterday as there might be some retracements to the 50 and 200-day moving averages as a lot of the stocks are trading quite high above them. Almost all sectors were in the red yesterday with energy and real estate being the most heavily hit by the increasing restrictions also there was no clear outperformer in large cap vs small caps though momentum and growth did a littler better than the value plays. The recent drops and stagnation in the stock market is likely due to investors not knowing what to focus on, as the vaccine news have been a great positive and will help the economy recover in the future but in the meantime the pandemic is raging on and the near term future is uncertain. [CHART](https://ibb.co/fHsqMHt) [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hDRdM8G) [CHART](https://ibb.co/7tFNCy4)

Yesterday we saw some great numbers as the October housing starts were almost 5% better month to month as Today we are going to receive some critical economic data that might see the market recover a little or if they are bad can accelerate the correction as initial jobless claims and continuing jobless claims come in the early part of the morning. [ECONOMIC CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZdBVH9m)

Also, yesterday the American Association of Individual Investors released the weekly investor sentiment survey as bullishness has declined by more than 11% since last week, as investors switch to a more neutral approach. I believe this is a great contrarian indicator as more people become bearish you can find better buying opportunities in the stock market [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/7RZK3j4)

So after the close yesterday Nvidia announced a beat of 36 cents on the expectation with an EPS of 2,91$ which is a more than 1$ improvement since last year and a beat of over 300 million $ on revenue, which have seen a more than 50% increase since last year. Gaming revenues came in even better than expected at 2,27 billion$ while data center revenue also improved more than 160% year over year and also was better than expectations. [NVIDIA REVENUE](https://ibb.co/hcTzGSj) [NVIDIA FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/SBh3BTY)

Gross profit margin decreased year over year but is still better through the first 9 months of the year. With the net income for the company being also in line with these numbers. [NVIDIA EPS](https://ibb.co/wdGD49R)

They also announced they will give out a dividend, it does have a small yield but it’s better than nothing and also gave guidance for next quarter that was 10% better than forecasted on revenue with the gross margin also expected to improve about 140 basis points. [NVIDIA DIVIDEND](https://ibb.co/tKgC0Qx)

Nvidia might get a boost soon as they have just refiled the merger notification for the ARM deal, if they do manage to acquire ARM, this will greatly improve the company’s outlook as it might propel them to join the tech trillion dollar valuation as the global gaming industry has spiked up almost 20% year over year and is expected to have a compound annual growth of almost 10% in the next years. [GAMING INDUSTRY](https://ibb.co/Y73jC3s) [GAMING CAGR](https://ibb.co/K64FsYW) [NVIDIA ARM DEAL](https://ibb.co/5RM0Cvp)

So I believe they are a great company to invest in for the future and you can buy this dip after the earnings because there was no week point in them, I would buy more of the company if the stock falls under 500$. [NVIDIA PRE-MARKET](https://ibb.co/1ntybNM)

Yesterday Apple also announced that they will cut the apple store tax in half to 15% for smaller developers starting next year. Though this impacts 98% of developers in the app store, it will only affect about 5% of the revenue so the impact on the EPS should be pretty small as Morgan Stanley only expects this to be a 3 cents per share down-risk for Apple. This action has been taken by the company to probably divide developers as they continue the legal battle with Epic Games. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/PMbFv3f) [APPLE IMPACT](https://ibb.co/TqsrSTc)

Also, two big retailers released earnings yesterday with Target delivering a solid beat of more than a dollar per share and a revenue beat of almost 2 billion $ with comparable sales almost doubling the expectations. They did not provide any guidance but a strong holiday season will likely see the company doing very well in the next quarter. The company saw a huge increase in both traditional store of 10% and a stunning 155% growth in online sales. This came alongside a 80 basis points increase in gross margin as well to top the expectations. This led the stock to gain more than 2% on a day when the stock market was trending down. [TGT DIGITAL SALES](https://ibb.co/Jtp0NV7) [TGT EPS](https://ibb.co/Hxd2NcD)

The other big retailer that released earnings was Lowe’s as the company just beat the expectations by 2 cents but delivered a better result on revenue while the comparable sales were up more than 30% and the online sales more than doubled for the company. This wasn’t enough for the stock to hold as it saw the price plunge by more than 8% on the day as investors were not impressed by the weak profit guidance for next quarter with an EPS between 1,10$ to 1,20$ versus the expectations of 1,17$. I don’t think was a good indicator for the company’s outlook and could be a great opportunity to buy the stock on the dip. [LOWES STATS](https://ibb.co/WsWrfZV) [LOWES EPS](https://ibb.co/Q6rtWZQ)

A quick though about the Tesla stock being added to the SP doesn’t add any significant value for the company but it is an important milestone as 51 billion $ worth of other SP500 position will be sold so that the company can be added to the  index fund. They are the biggest company ever to be added to the index. Tesla Is not a traditional car company, it’s a disruptive technology company on the EV front, that’s why its valuation is so high compared to other car makers like you can see in this report from Morgan Stanley as they raised the price target by almost 200$ to a price of 540$ for the stock. This is also helped by more and more countries imposing restrictions and announcing bans on traditional fossil fueled cars in the future.   [BRITAIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/CM4PmQ8) [MS Analysts](https://ibb.co/N2b2fdJ)

Other news came yesterday for companies like Shopify which will accept direct payments via Alipay which has more than 1 billion users in China which will improve the payment flow for companies that use the platform. [SHOPIFY NEWS](https://ibb.co/vZSDLNn)

While NIO gained target boost from multiple banks like JP Morgan, Bank of America and others as they expect the company to be a long-term winner in the premium EV space and gain a significant market share in the next decade, the stock did fell on the report that Nikola and GM are close to finalizing the deal to manufacture the Nikola Badger as Nikola shares gained more than 15% on the day. [NIO NEWS](https://ibb.co/8XQLG85) [NIKOLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6gmZqXL)

Also, the controversial company Palantir secured another US army contract and saw it’s shares rise again to all time highs intra-day, as the company keeps getting the stamp of approval from the government with more and more contracts. [PALANTIR NEWS](https://ibb.co/GMpQWj0)

Google also seems to be jumping in the action for more and more online payments solutions as the company will allow users to open bank accounts through Google Pay. The accounts will not be charged monthly fees or require minimum balances which is pretty much in line with the other competitors aproach. [GOOGLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/tPXXmz0)

And one final though just like Bill Gates said yesterday, Zoom will continue be a great company to own, as they’re product is superior to competitors, business travel will never go back to what it was, this is happening while a lot of people are taking risks and dumping money in cruise lines stocks and restaurant stocks.

### Market Notes:

Yesterday near the end of the day sellers took over and the markets all ended in the red after spending most of the day in the green. This sell-off broke critical support levels.

I've been calling for a bull run into the end of the year but I could be wrong. I'm a trader at the end of the day. I create a theory and get paid when it's right. But I must always be prepared to be wrong.

Trading is not about being right. It's about being flexible and changing you're opinion when the situation changes.

Yet another vaccine is showing promising results this morning. And PFE's is better than first announced.

SPACs, EVs and green energy seem to be the hottest plays in the market right.

Futures are down this morning. I'll be a little more cautious today. I'm not here to be right, I'm here to make money.

 The study of 560 healthy adults, including 240 over the age of 70-years-old, found the vaccine to be safe and produced a similar immune response among people aged over 56-years-old and those aged between 18 and 55.

* British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which is working in collaboration with the University of Oxford, has previously said interim data showed their experimental vaccine had produced an immune response in older and younger adults.
* The authors of the Oxford study said their results could be encouraging if the immune responses are found to be associated with protection against Covid-19 infection.
* The phase two trial did not assess vaccine efficacy, however, and phase three trials are ongoing to confirm this.

 The preliminary findings of a phase two trial show that the coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca is safe and triggers a similar immune response among all adults.

The promising early-stage results were published in The Lancet, one of the world’s top medical journals, on Thursday.

The study of 560 healthy adults, including 240 over the age of 70-years-old, found the vaccine to be safe and produced a similar immune response among people aged over 56-years-old and those aged between 18 and 55.

 British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which is working in collaboration with the University of Oxford, has previously said interim data showed their experimental vaccine had produced an immune response in older and younger adults.

A safe and effective vaccine is seen by many as a game-changer in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of over 1.3 million people worldwide.

Huge challenges remain before a vaccine can be rolled out, however. The global battle to secure prospective supplies has raised alarm about equitable access, while questions remain over logistics, distribution, and cost.

The Oxford vaccine candidate was found to cause few side effects and triggered immune responses in both parts of the immune system in all age groups and at low and standard doses.

The preliminary results showed that the vaccine — ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 — prompted what’s known as a “T-cell response” within 14 days of the first dose, and an antibody response within 28 days of the booster dose. Scientists expect T-cell responses to play a role in long-term immunity against the virus.

Dr. Maheshi Ramasamy, a co-author of the study at the University of Oxford, said the antibody and T-cell responses among older adults were “robust” and “encouraging.”

“The populations at greatest risk of serious COVID-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults,” Ramasamy said.

“We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.”

## Study limitations

The authors of the Oxford study said their results could be encouraging if the immune responses are found to be associated with protection against Covid-19 infection. The phase two trial did not assess vaccine efficacy, however, and phase three trials are ongoing to confirm this.

Results are expected later this year depending on the rate of infection within clinical trial communities.

The authors noted some limitations to their study, including that participants in the oldest age group had an average age of 73 to 74 and few underlying health conditions, and almost all participants were White and non-smokers.

People from a range of backgrounds, countries, and ethnicities were said to be included in the phase three trial.

The study comes days after two other vaccine makers announced encouraging results from phase three trials. They said their experimental vaccines were found to be highly effective in protecting against the coronavirus, boosting optimism at a time when health systems in Europe and the U.S. are once again being pushed to breaking point.

Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday a final analysis found their vaccine candidate was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 and appeared to fend off severe disease. Earlier this week, Moderna had said preliminary phase three trial data showed its vaccine was 94.5% effective.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,563864,public,confidence,self,Oxford Covid vaccine trials indicate it is safe,0,[],0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jwykdr/oxford_covid_vaccine_trials_indicate_it_is_safe/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Support needs to hold at 355.80 (ish), and she will head to the resistance of the downtrend at around 358.91 (ish).\n\n[1 hr. chart](https://preview.redd.it/nm87wvzul3061.png?width=2466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5af184a1dcc0dbda5201874a4143101924bc939b)\n\nProjection from yesterday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zfqchqbhs3061.png?width=3012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5be4695073a27627b7481e0b2b153dc594ceb8a7\n\nHere’s what the before and mid fall looked like on the daily chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bidfxcmcm3061.png?width=3030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e840d174f2fb226a3cbb57a572fd3f518d9fff91\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/720dbw4jm3061.png?width=3510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34ab76dc865b74a57a0eea86a3007336f97631d5\n\nHowever, the first test will be 357.84 (ish).

Stocks traded choppily today, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones finishing modestly red, despite more positive vaccine news from Pfizer (PFE).

This week, there has been great news on the development of a coronavirus vaccine, fueling optimism that the pandemic may be over in the coming months. Today, Pfizer announced it had concluded its Phase 3 trial and found its vaccine candidate to be 95% effective against COVID-19, up from the 90% effectiveness reported last week and roughly the same rate as the vaccine candidate Moderna (MRNA) is developing. According to the company, “Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics; observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%”. Pfizer said it now has the safety data required to submit for emergency use authorization with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “within days” and plans to produce 50 million doses by the end of the year and 1 billion by the end of next year. However, it is important to remember that implementing a global distribution network for the vaccine will still take some time, even after approval is granted.

Recently, the market has experienced a rotation out of the previously high-flying tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks that were hit hard by the pandemic. The Russell 2000 index outperformed the market and jumped to a record-high. Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist for ProShares, expects market participants to continue to buy cyclical and reopening stocks that are cheap compared to before the pandemic.

Unfortunately, despite positive news on the vaccine front, coronavirus cases continue to skyrocket. In the United States, sadly the country recorded 1,707 coronavirus-related deaths, a new record since the pandemic began, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. New daily cases and hospitalization are also at record-highs, with an average of 150,000 new cases per day and more than 73,000 people hospitalized nationwide. In response to the surge, governors from both sides of the political aisle have begun reintroducing restrictions to slow the spread. California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is “pulling the emergency brake” on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as ""feel-good"" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. ""If Iowans don't buy into this, we'll lose,"" she said. ""Businesses will close once again, more schools will be forced to go online, and our health care system will fail.""

Is a good strategy to invest during this period of time on stocks? Generally? Where I can find historic data about other companies before adding to Sp500? What I mean is the period since the news are announced until the day the stock enter in the sp500.

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.

Please let me know if you found this post valuable. I'm considering starting a tech/investing newsletter where I analyse tech trends and look at associated investment opportunities. Would love to know if that's something people would be interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bottoms-Up Software Sales**

The ""bottoms up"" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.

The premise behind the bottoms-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottoms-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.

For example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.

There are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottoms-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottoms-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.

## What's so special about bottoms-up?

There are a number of distinct advantages to the bottoms-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottoms-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.
* **More money for R&amp;D.** Since bottoms-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  
   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&amp;D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....
* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottoms-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.
* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottoms-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.

## What to look for in a bottoms-up company

Not all bottoms-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Look for a ""receptive"" market.** The bottoms-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.
* **World-class design.** Bottoms-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.
* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottoms-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottoms-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.
* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottoms-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.
* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.

## Bottoms-Up Companies

Below are some bottoms-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).

### Asana ($ASAN):

Asana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottoms-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.

I like Asana for a couple of reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottoms-up strategy is working very well.
2. **R&amp;D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottoms-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&amp;D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.
3. **Product &amp; design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.
4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.

### Slack ($WORK) :

Slack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.

I like Slack for a couple of reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.
2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottoms-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.
3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottoms-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.

### Honourable Mentions:

Below are some more bottoms-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Zoom ($ZM)
2. Atlassian ($TEAM)
3. Datadog ($DDOG)
4. Zendesk ($ZEN)
5. Hubspot ($HUBS)

### Market Notes:

The S&amp;P 500 dipped yesterday but held support at previous record highs. This is a very bullish sign.

Futures are up this morning and I expect the buying to continue until at least the end of the year.

Major retailers WMT and TGT have both seen explosive sales growth amid the pandemic. I'll be paying special attention to online retailers as we enter the holiday shopping season.

Stocks fell modestly today after yesterday’s rally on the back of Moderna’s (MRNA) positive vaccines news. Despite the decline, the indexes are still having a great week. 

After Moderna released preliminary data Monday morning showing its vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective in preventing new coronavirus infections, the indexes spiked before losing momentum the next day, very similar to last week after Pfizer’s (PFE) announcement. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the week plays out, given the similarities to last week. After Pfizer announced its positive vaccine data last Monday, the market spiked Monday before cooling off throughout the week, after it became clear that distribution is still months away. So far it’s playing out exactly the same.

Going forward, notable analysts expect near-term volatility in the market but are overall bullish going into next year. Seema Shah, investing chief strategist at Principal Global is bullish going into next year. She said, “Not only do we have a potential vaccine in play, but we also have all the central banks providing endless liquidity. We have fiscal stimulus on the cards and of course we have an economic recovery which either is going to be ongoing. So I think as investors look at this, there are a lot of reasons to have a pro-cyclical trade on. It’s just a question of maybe maintaining some caution as you move into that.” Mike Wilson, strategist at Morgan Stanley said, “expects the S&amp;P 500 will be range-bound between 3,150 and 3,550 as the market grapples with rising new COVID-19 cases and restrictions, before jumping to 3,900 by year-end next year. 

In other news, with cases surging across the United States, many states, both Democrat and Republican, are reintroducing restrictions to combat the spread of the virus. California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is “pulling the emergency brake” on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. Larger counties were moved back into the most restrictive reopening tier by the governor, meaning that indoor dining and some other businesses would have to shut down again. He said the state was also studying curfew options.  In Iowa, Republican governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as ""feel-good"" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. ""If Iowans don't buy into this, we'll lose,"" she said. ""Businesses will close once again, more schools will be forced to go online, and our health care system will fail."" The US recently passed 11 million cases, with the country currently experiencing record highs in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.

**Highlights**

Moderna just announced a new vaccine, what does this mean for the stock market? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/GMCv9B1)

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indices in the green with a late push to end the day. The dow was the biggest gainer up 1,6% and also posted a new record close just shy of the 30k mark [CHART](https://ibb.co/NrF0HWc) ,while the broader SP500 trailed a little the whole day and finished up 1,17%  [CHART](https://ibb.co/xhkQWnk) while even the tech heavy Nasdaq finished in the green after a slow start to the day on the Moderna vaccine news with a late push to end up 0,8% [CHART](https://ibb.co/tcGnChD). The VIX continued to decline to it lowest levels since august as it continues to slowly trend to it’s pre-shutdown levels [CHART](https://ibb.co/Wfy5Kg6). Almost all sectors [CHART](https://ibb.co/hLY6Fzx) were in the green yesterday as a repeat of last Monday happened with Energy, Industrials and Financials having a good boost from the Moderna news with over 3 quarters of the companies advancing and 141 of them making new highs [CHART](https://ibb.co/qMjmtwf), the average volume return to normal, as there was not such a big transition in portfolios like a week ago. The rally was mostly pushed by small cap and value plays as even the Russel 2000 made new highs after this news. [CHART](https://ibb.co/PQb0kJw)

This is the HEAT map from yesterday and as you can see, most of the companies gained, except the ones from Health Care, where all of the money rushed to Moderna [CHART](https://ibb.co/3YkLfw8), but I believe this is a great misjudgment for investors, as there is not a lot of money to be made on this vaccine, and this is the only product they offer at the moment, so I don’t think it really deserves the 100$ price range in which it has traded yesterday. I don’t like this stock at all at this point, if you do want to play the vaccine news and profits you should look at other companies that will help distribute it like CVS, Walgreens, McKesson, Costco, Walmart and others. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ByMvyxs)

Before the open today we will here from Walmart and Home depot which release earnings reports, this is also followed by economic reports like retail sales, business inventories and some other interesting events that are due later. [EVENTS](https://ibb.co/WfzJdMk) [BEFORE OPEN](https://ibb.co/WvKW8hn)

So, let’s talk about what the vaccine news were yesterday as Moderna  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/52fSmF4) announced a vaccine that has an even better efficiency than Pfizer’s at over 94% and also doesn’t require such extreme temperatures to be stored and transported, Pfizer required under -80 degrees Celsius while Moderna is stable up to 6 months at only -20 degrees Celsius or even at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 30days. So, there is expectation that both Moderna and Pfizer will file for the FDA emergency use authorization very soon. Both will require 2 shots for the vaccine to be effective almost a month apart. This will also be followed in the next few months with results from AstraZeneca and JNJ so the more vaccines that are available the faster the pandemic will end, but I wouldn’t rush out of the tech names that have brought the market here, they are here to stay even after this all ends. The world didn’t just run into tech companies because of the pandemic, the world was already going there but this was only accelerated by this, and I don’t see companies that don’t need to going back to the way it was, because this has brought better margin profits for many companies as there are fewer expenses with the work from home environment.

So in my opinion The markets are likely going to keep it up, as I don’t see a crash or a pullback soon as there are a lot more positives then negatives for the stock market. The only negative is that the reopening is not happening yet, but that will come next year, while there are a lot of positives like better treatments, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and probably more to come, a probably divided congress which is good news for not many changes that affect the stock market [MARKET GAIN](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy), the ultra-low interest rates that are here to stay for a while as the Fed will keep the economy going and a probable stimulus that will come eventually.  [LIQUIDITY](https://ibb.co/6wx3gBz)

There are a lot of things that drives stocks higher like very good earnings [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/hXCwZGD) from most of the companies that I really think will continue to be very good and even get better in the next years as more money will be put into the economy by the fed and eventually by the consumers also the companies are starting to pay dividends again and there is a lot of money still on the sidelines that can come back in the stock market. [https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy)

This year is the second time that ETF’s have had a more than 400 billion dollars of inflow and that will likely keep going up, as investors are leaving low rate bonds and taking on more risk with equities as the US total assets under management are up over 5 Trillion $.  [INTEREST RATES](https://ibb.co/8KCWtqr)

Meanwhile after the close yesterday, it was announced that Tesla will finally be included in the SP500 on the 21st of December this year. This is after the company has had a longer path of profitability with 5 straight quarters of profit even with the pandemic ranging on. This will probably lead to a higher demand for the stock as index funds will need to buy the stock. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ZL7wJC)

As you can see people have turned around opinions on the company as the short interest has plummeted from over 200 million shares to below 50 million shores in less than 2 years. That is a decrease of over 70% in just 12 months. [CHART](https://ibb.co/frL3ZGT)

Tesla has become the largest ever company to be added to the SP500, and will likely replace one of the bottom companies from the oil industry in the index. The company will have a 1% weight in the SP as the committee estimates the funding for the trade will need over 50 billion dollars, one of the largest in the SP History. The stock traded as much as 525 intra-day before dropping to below 400 after they were not included in the SP500 last go around [CHART](https://ibb.co/m5NxHGB). Even more actively managed funds that try to beat the SP will be forced to decide if they buy Tesla shares or not, as the company may give them a downside risk due to its high potential of growth, such funds manage trillions of dollars that could also pour into the stock. 

And With factories ramping up like Shanghai which will produce 1million vehicles, Freemont as well, and with Austin and Berlin factories expected to produce at least 500k, they will likely be able to produce over 2 million cars in 2022 or 2023, which is a great increase from around 600thousand/year capacity at the moment. [FACTORIES](https://ibb.co/DWWXWQK)

The stock has surged after hours more than 13% to around 460$ but I really like the company, and I believe the stock can go higher in the long term especially, I have a price target of just over 600$ for tesla, but we can see a re-test of the 500$ level very soon in the stock, with the EV push that is expected to come in the next years.  [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/yXGxzFb) [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Qdt07QR)

One other big thing to follow today after the close is what NIO reports as the company has been targeted by short sellers recently and saw the stock drop from its highs over 50$ to barely 40$ in the span of a couple of days but has since recovered as a lot of people are very optimistic of the earnings report. The company is expected to lose around 17 cents per shares and have a revenue of over 600 million dollars, double the revenue that the company had a year ago. The stock has not beaten the estimates of earnings yet in the last 2 years, so this will be very good if the company finally manages to do that. [NIO](https://ibb.co/1R0bSXm)

Also, after the close, COSTCO announced a special dividend for shareholders of 10$ as they continue to be one of the greatest companies to own, as management has constantly taken care of shareholders with great dividends and great growth for the company. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hKbnFpQ)

One other interesting news came from Nvidia which release a huge product, as the company release a new GPU with more than 80 gigabytes of memory, doubling the old model, this are huge performance numbers that are required in the new world of cloud computing. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/bX60cqv)

### Market Notes:

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosures came out after the market closed yesterday. The fund added several big pharmas including PFE. Also worth noting it picked up shares of TMUS too. Sometimes Buffett's new investment gets a pop after the disclosures.

TSLA popped after hours when news broke that it would be included in the S&amp;P 500. It was passed over a few weeks ago. this move adds legitimacy to the company. This move is likely to drive sympathy plays in the EV and green energy space.

Futures are down this morning after the S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs for 2 days in a row.

I am nowhere near ready to actually start trading or anything which is why I just wanted to do the $1 or one share, and leave it and just observe it. 

Is this a good or bad idea? 

Also when you first make an account (especially in Australia) is there any processes you need to go through? Like do you need to get “approved” or talk with your bank or let anyone know you’re investing in the stock market (like how when you start a business you have to register and go through processes to let them know you’ve started a business)? 

Or is it just free for anyone to start investing and you don’t need to do anything?

Also when you talk about portfolio.. can everyone else see this and will this be judged by your bank? Like depending on what your portfolio is, will your bank approve/disprove you for certain things or is the portfolio just personal for your own viewing?

I am just curious about this news, does this mean it has only been announced or that S&amp;P500 has bought the shares to be added to th index?

The reason I ask this is I am wondering whether to sell now or wait until it is in S&amp;P500 for another price spike.

Currently at 26K (still way off from '89s 30k ATH) we've got a +13% since Nov 2. To give you an idea, the 1st of Jan was @ 23.2K and Corona bottom was @ 16.5K. 

I feel that JP stocks don't get as much love as they could and the industry here is nothing to be easily dismissed. 

For full disclaimer: I've recently got into Nikkei 225 ETFs to add to my current collection of US, Europe and China stocks and bonds as I thought it was a bit undervalued, more so compared to the US.

Soros Fund Management and Third Point each bought more than 18 million and 2.4 million shares of Palantir respectively.

“Soros Fund Management, run by billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, and Third Point, the firm led by occasional activist investor Dan Loeb, both disclosed late Friday that they own shares of Palantir.

The Soros investment was worth about $175.3 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That works out to a purchase price of $9.50 a share. Palantir's stock is currently trading at just under $16 a share, so the Soros stake is now valued at about $294 million.

Palantir went public through a direct listing of existing stock on the New York Stock Exchange. That means Palantir didn't need to sell new shares through a more traditional initial public offering. It's how Spotify (SPOT) and Slack (WORK) also started trading on Wall Street.

Shares of Palantir have more than doubled from their so-called reference price of $7.25 a share on the day of the direct listing. Palantir is now worth nearly $30 billion.”

I've realised that all of my biggest investing losses have been when I didn't know much about the company I was buying and the market it was in. Or when I tried to time the market and buy/sell at certain times. My biggest wins have come from buying companies that I understand really well and holding them for longer.

I work at a large enterprise tech company, so for me this means focusing on other enterprise software companies. I often get exposure to these companies because I use their products at work. This helps me to get a far better understanding of their likelihood of future success. I also plan to hold each investment I make for a minimum of 5 years. (Ideally 10+ years).

There's nothing novel about this approach. Buffet calls it focusing on your ""circle of competence"". But sometimes, you need to come to the same conclusion through your own direct experience.

The stock market rallied today, with the Dow Jones reaching record highs, after Moderna (MRNA) announced promising data for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, adding to hopes that an effective vaccine may soon be available. Remember Pfizer (PFE) also announced positive vaccine data last week.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.19% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.78% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing the day 1.67% up.

Early Monday, Moderna (MRNA) announced that preliminary data from its late-stage clinical trial showed its vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 in participants. This study, known as the COVE study, enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the U.S. Based on the data, the company said it “ intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks.” The company reported they expect to have prepared 20 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year and between 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021. The company is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Operation Warp Speed, McKesson (MCK), and governments across the globe to plan for distribution. Moderna’s vaccine candidate is a lot easier to ship than Pfizer’s candidate, which requires super cold temperatures. The company said, “vaccine candidate now expected to remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for 30 days, up from the previous estimate of 7 days. Shipping and long-term storage conditions at standard freezer temperatures of -20°C (-4°F) for 6 months. mRNA-1273 is to be distributed using widely available vaccine delivery and storage infrastructure. However, it is important to note that setting up a global distribution network for the vaccine is likely to take months. Here is the link to the Company’s press release: [https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy))

Over the weekend, the United States topped 11 million coronavirus cases, with 250,000 people tragically dead, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US is nearly averaging 150,000 new infections per day, the most since the pandemic started by a wide margin, with the number still growing. Around four weeks ago, the US first crossed the 100,000 cases per day mark for the first time. In recent days, more cities and states have added curfews and tightened their restrictions on daily activities as case counts soar. New Jersey’s new daily COVID-19 cases hit a record high on Saturday, and Illinois and Ohio both saw record numbers of new cases on Friday. Chicago posted a stay-at-home advisory late last week, and New York state had a new 10 p.m. curfew on bars, restaurants and gyms go into effect Friday. Oregon ordered a two-week “freeze” on non-essential business activity and large social gatherings. The recent surge in case is once again straining hospital capacity, with around 70,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across the US. This number is also growing at a record rate. Therefore, during the next weeks we expect a gradual tightening of restrictions nationwide. While it is highly unlikely we return a lockdown like earlier in the year, we expect states to enact restrictions to combat the recent surge in cases.

&amp;#x200B;

I succesfully bought the call.... but how do I secure the profits? I have different options in different tabs I can interact. If I look over in my positions, it says I can **close** the option. What does that mean? However if I go over to the options trading tab, I can sell my option too... at a certain limit price... but wouldn't that defeat the purpose of having the price of the stock raise? Meaning I can just buy it and sell it for a higher price no matter the stock price?

Today will be a comparison between Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Lets first look at the company moats, starting with Pepsi...\n\n# PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP):\n\nDividend Aristocrat: 48 Years of Consecutive Dividend Growth\n\nPepsi isn't only the #2 beverage company (Just behind KO), but it is the #1 in snacks. It's business is concentrated on convienience items and is divided into the following 6 segments:\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) is the global leader in the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of food (52%) and beverages (48%). The company is # 2 only to Coca-Cola in beverages, and # 1 in snacks. Profits are derived approximately 58% from the United States and 42% international. (Revenue based on October 2020 reports)\n\n* PepsiCo America Beverages (34% of Revenues)\n* Frito-Lay North America (25%)\n* PepsiCo Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (16%)\n* Latin America Foods (11%)\n* PepsiCo AMEA (Asia, Middle East, North Africa) 10%\n* Quaker Foods North America (4%)\n\nThe following are noteworthy brands that are owned by PepsiCo:\n\n&gt;Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7 Up, Miranda, Sierra Mist, Gatorade, Tropicana, Lipton, Aquafina, Brisk, Starbucks RTD Beverages, Lay’s, Doritos, Quaker, Cheetos, Ruffles, Tostitos, Fritos, and Walkers.\n\nTheir expose to food/snacks provides a significant advantage to Pepsi, greatly increasing its yearly revenue, and providing the company significant staying power. (Especially during market downturns). The biggest weakness to their model is the move towards healthier food and drink options, Pepsi is very aware of this and is aggressively moving into this market, currently,  Approximately 25% of PepsiCo revenues come from everyday nutrition products. \n\nSo let's compare their business to Coca-Cola.\n\n# Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)\n\nDividend King: 58 Years of Consecutive Dividend Growth\n\nCoca-Cola is the largest nonalcoholic beverage company in the world. Unlike PepsiCo, Coca-Cola remains exclusively in the beverage business. Some of its brands include:\n\n&gt;Coca-Cola, Fanta, Schweppes, Sprite, Dasani, Smartwater, Powerade, VitaminWater, Minute Maid, Innocent, Simply, Fairlife, Georgia Coffee, Costa Coffee **(A recent UK Acquisition),** Fuze Tea, Honest, Gold Peak, Peace Tea\n\nCoca-Cola's concentration in the beverage industry is what allows them to dominate. They have very high brand loyalty, direct manufacturing and distribution systems, and established relationships with retailers worldwide which provide significant barriers to entry for any potential new competitors. Recently Coke has made some smart acquisitions, such as Costa Coffee in the UK (about 1/3 of all coffee sales), and has been eliminating less popular products to increase revenue and focus on what is working.\n\nIts advantage is also its greatest weakness, Coca-Colas company model relies solely on the beverage industry which makes it much more susceptible to market fluctuations, and environmental issue, such as reliance on potable pure water. Additionally Coke has done less than Pepsi to move into healthier industries. It is very likely on their radar. \n\n# Quick Look at Numbers:\n\nNOTE: Numbers are currently for November 2020 and are likely to change.\n\n|\\-|PEPSICO|COCA-COLA|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.09|$1.64|\n|Yield|2.83%|3.07%|\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|8%|6.9%|\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|9%|4.6%|\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|8.7%|2.6%|\n|Current Payout Ratio|\\~73%|\\~77%|\n|Free Cash Flow / Share|$4.56|$1.50|\n|Revenue|$18.09 Billion|$8.65 Billion|\n|Debt / Equity Ratio|3.31 (Not very Healthy)|2.84 (Healthier but still eh)|\n\nBased on the basic numbers and the previously mentioned business model Pepsi has a bit more stability when compared to Coca-Cola due to having a wider market and increased revenue. However we can also see that PepsiCo currently leverages more debt, however most of it is long term debt that is very unlikely to adversely affect the company, especially since consumer defensive companies are profitable even in market downturns. \n\nBased on the dividend growth, Pepsi is the clear winner. It has had a higher 10 year return, and its recent history shows that it isn't slowing down. The payouts are very similar, and if Coca-Cola does not increase its dividend growth rate then Pepsi will overtake its yield in the near future. The payout ratios are a bit high right now, below 75% is a better ratio, however this can be given a pass since 2020 has been a wild ride, if those ratios continue to increase over the next years then that will call their dividend safety into question.\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\nThe future for the companies will be interesting. Undoubtedly we will see more advancement into healthier beverage/food options, but the bigger question is what will Coca-Cola's future moves be after eliminating its less popular brands? How will environmental factors affect their businesses. \n\nWhich is your favorite between the two? Or both? Both is good?\n\nPlease supplement this with your own research, we only glanced at the numbers, so take the time to read more into their books or business models. \n\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!"", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good Morning/Evening everyone.

The company said it plans to submit an Emergency Use Authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks and expects it to be based on the final analysis of 151 cases and a median follow-up for more than two months.

Moderna said the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 trial is based on the analysis of COVID-19 cases starting two weeks after the second does of vaccine. The first analysis was based on 95 cases with 90 cases in the placebo group and 5 in the mRNA-1273 group.

### Market Notes:

The S&amp;P 500 closed at a fresh record high on Friday. No big surprise for me. I expect the bull run to continue until the end of the year.

Markets are unconcerned with the pandemic, lack of stimulus, and the President at this point. All focus is on the vaccines and the Fed.

As long as the vaccines and Fed hold their current trajectory and nothing else changes expect buying to continue until the end of the year.

[THUMB](https://ibb.co/j64rkG0)

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with a recap of Friday’s movements in the stock market and what happened last week as we saw the Dow finishing Friday up 1,37% [CHART](https://ibb.co/HHPdbR9), the S&amp;P500 up almost the same while closing at a record level for the index [CHART](https://ibb.co/HTG25s0) and the Nasdaq composite being up just over 1% [CHART](https://ibb.co/274Gq6g).

Almost 80% of companies were advancing on Friday as the stock market finished the week strong with an almost 90% ratio of new highs vs lows but the volume was way below average on Friday as most investors finished restructuring they’re portfolios in the early part of the week after the Vaccine news [CHART](https://ibb.co/sbn5dWp).

Also this week we saw the largest ever global equity inflow as you can see in this Bank of American chart as there were over 40 billion dollars being pushed in equities. [CHART](https://ibb.co/18g7xrJ)

All sectors finished in the green on Friday with real estate, energy and industrial leading the way with all 3 sectors having more than 50% of companies up over 2%, even tech kept up the pace after leading us through this recovery with over 37% of companies being up more than 2% on the day.

We also saw small-cap and value plays outperform again as people are betting that the economy will have a broader breadth of recovery after the vaccine will be available. [CHART](https://ibb.co/jTMx5ry)

The VIX also finished the week very strong as it continued to decline to it’s lowest level, ending the week at the 23 level. [CHART](https://ibb.co/j4057B8)

As you can see in both the SP500 heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/dW01vyR) and the world heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/G2Fvk7c) almost all companies were in the green on Friday with a few exceptions like Nvidia, NetFlix and Alibaba, as they were punished a little after the huge run they in the last 9 months while Alibaba continues to struggle with the Chinese government.

The COVID-19 numbers are dangerously going up as you can see, with daily cases going parabolic, indeed with a bigger number of tests being taken but there is still a huge rise in positivity rate, and as you can see this is the 3rd hump of the pandemic in terms of numbers of hospitalized people. The one positive thing for the moment is that deaths haven’t gone up as much due to the better treatment but this number does usually trail the others so we will have to see what happens in the next weeks. [CHART](https://ibb.co/wdSTt4v)

Here you can see better that weekly test are up almost 10% while weekly cases have gone up 4times that much almost at a 40% growth rate while the hospitalized and deaths have not increased as much as the cases yet. [CHART](https://ibb.co/QpzPbs8)

This weeks interesting earnings [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/K5bMM4B) in my opinion will come from Walmart and Home Depot before the open on Tuesday as I expect both of them to dazzle in the earnings reports, while Walmart is expected to have an EPS of 1$ and 19 cents I expect them to be around 1,5$ at least like last quarter while Home depot is expected to have an EPS of just over 3$ I expect that to be at least 30cents to half a $ better then expected also as the companies look to continue the amazing earnings season that is mostly ending this week as we saw an overwhelming number of companies beating the estimates by quite a gap.

This will be followed after the close with the Concept company NIO which has been going up amazingly in the last weeks as it has touched even 54$ but has since seen a pullback of almost 10$, so be careful when trading this, it may be a bumpy ride as the company is still losing money and seeking to increase manufacturing and sales, as I don’t see them having to much of a success in Europe even if the manage to launch they’re cars there, this because people will have a stigma for the company as being Chinese, and not offering great quality. Despite the recent Chinese movements some good news came in on Sunday as China has formed the largest free trade block that includes fifteen Asia-Pacific Economies with big names like Japan, South Korea, Australia and others being included [NEWS](https://ibb.co/XbcqV80). This group will account for 30% of the global economy and population. This will probably bold well for NIO as it has tanked after Citron released a statement that they are taking profits in NIO [NEWS](https://ibb.co/SQBbW6s).

Moving on Wednesday we will also get some other retailers reports with Target and Lowe’s releasing reports also before the open. I believe this two will be impacted by what Walmart and Home Depot announce, if they have great results expect them the stocks to see a double move on Tuesday and Wednesday. Also, one of the biggest gainer of the stay at home moves, nVidia, will report after the close as I expect them do have great earnings again as they will continue to benefit a lot from the stay-at-home economy as October videogame sales were up 14% expect this also be translated into Nvidia’s earnings as this was the month before the new consoles from Microsoft and Sony were released. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/kK3WWj4)

So I really like all 3 of Home Depot, Walmart and Nvidia and if you want to make a gamble you can also make a small investment in Nio, as there are no other big catalysts at the moment earnings may impact the stocks and we can see a re-test of highs for all of them.

One other company that I will keep my eye on is Disney as they beat the expectations for earnings, revenue and subscriber for the streaming business, I will watch what updates the investors meeting in December will provide us, as I really like the company and the stock very much, if they want to keep this going and become a rival for NetFlix they do have to invest much more money in content, as they will have to keep providing new content that generates growth for Disney+. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/QNCc3D3)

Some other news from the last days are that Qualcomm has received an exemption to sell chips to Huawei, which is not was expected that they would be allowed to sell 5G chips, but still is good news for the company as it provides another buyer for its products. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/ZVp8gTw)

While DraftKings soared on Friday after they announced better than expected results and guidance for the future. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qy9vmyB)

This came alongside the filing of documents for the hugely anticipated of DoorDash the leader in food delivery with a 50% market share. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/sWZDTpB)

I’d say it’s known to never just invest in one thing. Just Incase something goes wrong with it. Long term, what do you think the “right” number is as far as how many things to invest in? It will probably never be known 100%, but that’s what makes it fun as well. So it’s more of like a best guess. 

Please tell me what you think of my plan. I’m 31...so time on my side still! How does this sound for the next say 25-30 years? If I hold onto what I have and contribute to my Roth...

Last year I opened up a Roth IRA for the first time and put the max (for me) into it, $6,000. I plan on contributing regularly/annually. 

Over the past 10+ years I accumulated 300 ounces of silver and 5 ounces of gold. 

I have 8 Tom Brady rookie cards, 4 were signed when he was a rookie, so I think that’s pretty cool since it was before he did anything. The other 4 are decent ones too. For the 8, the current value is around $13,000-$15,000. So they should be (hopefully) at least double, if not way more in 30 years


So please tell me your thoughts. Do I have the right idea to spread it around and not put all of my money into the stock market going forward? Should I try and find a few more things to invest in, to spread it around more? Or call it good with what I have and just contribute to my Roth annually? 

I’d appreciate any advice!!!

I am really new to the world of stocks. I am 23 and my dad kept an e-trade stock account for me for my retirement.

He does not know the password or user is and asks me for it when he just wants to take a look at how the account is doing.

My question is: can my dad get into it and take money out of it?

My dad is abusive. My mom and I are leaving him. The stock account is all I have as a financial back-up. If he happened to wipe it (it is his money that he put in) then I would have no future retirement money.

Other benefits include “dedicated account management,” a one-year membership with Inspirato, a luxury vacation rental subscription service and “guaranteed nationwide aircraft availability up to 365 days a year,” according to the description.

I first bought in on June 11 which was right after it crashed from $24 to $17. I’ve added monthly ever since and my average price is currently $15. There’s still a lot of upside to this stock, I’m sure. I have to admit I was a little surprised to see the downtrend/flatlining from June - November which was not at all as volatile as March to June. I’d expected it to keep on being quite volatile. Anyway, it’s all good now I suppose. I’m hoping the new floor is more like $15 or preferably $17, obviously rather than ~$12 which has been the support level the past 3 months or so. 

Virus numbers are increasing day by day (but I suppose more people are getting tested now compared to earlier this year so that explains part of the increase). Still, Biden’s Covid team announced they won’t go for another lockdown as did Trump which is why JWN kept climbing, initiated by the promising Pfizer vaccine news. 

Earnings are coming up and Nordstrom’s anniversary sale turnover which is their biggest sale of the year will be included (as opposed to last year when this happened in Q2) and Erik Nordstrom, their CEO, said this year it was bigger than ever before. I’ve closely been checking reviews on Google for various Nordstrom and Rack stores and they are usually very good. People tend to post photos, too - on Google reviews and on Twitter, and generally their stores seem to have been buzzing. Maybe not as busy as pre-Covid but definitely not deserted as the dirt cheap stock price will have you believe. 

To me the future of JWN has to do mostly with whether you believe customers will continue to shop at department stores like Nordstrom, Macy’s and Kohl’s or if these will lose a huge chunk of their customer base to online stores like Amazon etc. 

Personally I believe once this virus disappears or people get immunity by vaccine, gradually we will go back to pre-Covid shopping routines. Sure, some will have been introduced to online shopping and stick with it but I think most people already knew about online shopping prior to Covid and I think the people that used to go to department stores will do that again. Online shopping isn’t a new thing. So why would people go to department stores a year ago if online shopping is better? Convenience is a relative matter. To a lot of people the shopping experience of going to a department store brings a lot of convenience with it. You can go with your friends. You can feel and try the items before you purchase them. You avoid the hassle of having to return items that aren’t the right size.. Amazon killed bookstores- because a book is always the same. You’d rarely need to return a book. Buying a suit, a dress or a pair of jeans is different. Zalando (big European apparel e-commerce site) recently announced that about half of the products they sell are returned. Half! That’s crazy. 

I’ve not mentioned all the things that make Nordstrom stand out between itself and its competition. First, keep in mind a lot of the competition has gone bankrupt. JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Lord &amp; Taylor.. the list goes on. Second, Nordstrom has so much going for it when it comes to adapting to a changing retail landscape. Less full line stores, more racks and locals. Expansion of curbside pickup. More things added to the shopping experience.. look it up yourself, there’s a lot of clever stuff. 

Anyway, I didn’t mean to make such a long post but I thank you if you want to share your thoughts on this stock.

Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance. The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies’ returns, according to the latest academic research into retail investing.

When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found.

In the case of Robinhood, they argue it’s even more extreme, since many users are first-time investors on a platform that offers frictionless trading and only limited information. For instance, users buy equities on the app’s “Top Mover” list more aggressively than other individual investors, meaning they’re more likely to trade extreme losers as well as winners.

This is a good example of do not chase hot stocks. Recently investors been chasing chinese ev stocks like crazy.

Any particular ways that people start looking for new stocks to invest in? I know generally you dont look at strictly how much the stock costs, but hpw much of a risk it has.

[Tesla rival? Bill Gates-backed electric vehicle battery startup comes into limelight](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/quantumscape-tesla-batteries)

Recently, InvestorPlace had articles on the potential upside for QuantumScape, setting an approximate price target north of $25.

I, of course, disagree with that assessment (disclosure: long on warrants).

The EV space commands higher tech-based multiples than paltry multiples assigned to traditional auto companies, for a good reason.

Long before the current controversies, and just before the ""IPO,"" Nikola (NKLA) closed at just under $34.

During the summer, electric truck startup Hyliion (HYLN) reached an all-time high of just under $56 (disclosure: was long on many warrants, currently still long on a select few warrants).

Next up, electric truck startup Lordstown Motors (RIDE) was given a $50 price target by BTIG's Gregory Lewis.  Had it not been for the Hindenburg short report on Nikola, this stock could have reached $40 or more before its ""IPO"" (disclosure: was long on many warrants).

If you're unfamiliar with Andrew Left, the name Citron Research probably sounds like something along the lines of a legitimate investment firm when you see it in a headline. It’s really just one guy, with a lengthy track record of lawsuits for baselessly attacking stocks in an attempt to profit off their downfall. He [sold NIO at $10 in 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/citrons-andrew-left-sells-out-of-chinas-tesla-rival-nio-2019-02-26) and has clearly been fuming over the profits he’s missed in the past months. Keep in mind, this guy has [shorted Tesla](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/andrew-left-shorting-tesla-stock-again-reasons-citron-betting-against-2020-2-1028876660) over and over without any luck, calling its meteoric rise artificial and insustainable, purely driven by hype. Now he’s shorting NIO on the same premise. Calling out the lack of short interest (aka optimism) also fails to corroborate his rationale for the stock falling to $25 - why even include that? 

On to his main point, which is that Tesla’s Model Y is expected to move to a starting price of ¥275k (~41k USD), spelling trouble for NIO’s competing ES6 and EC6 (currently starting at ~54k USD each). This ¥275k price projection is based on one Chinese analyst’s report and can essentially be taken with a grain of salt until Tesla says something confirmatory. Additionally, Left is either being incredibly naïve or incredibly disingenuous to assume NIO would roll over and allow itself to be outcompeted by a cheaper car model. This is a Chinese company we’re talking about. Left conveniently failed to make any mention of NIO’s upcoming economy models such as the ES3 and ET5 (the former being less than a year away with an expected price point of ~30k USD), nor did he write at all about NIO’s uniquely lucrative BaaS program or its ventures into fashion, entertainment, formula racing and more. Taking this into account, I don’t think the competition is as steep as Left claims. Tesla’s market share in China has rapidly declined in recent months as native EV companies push it out, going from [21% in August](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Electric-cars-in-China/Tesla-conquers-China-s-EV-market-with-taste-of-affordable-luxury#:~:text=Tesla%20doubled%20its%20China%20sales,to%2021%25%20from%206%25) to [10% as of 3 days ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/11/10/teslas-market-share-is-sliding-in-china-and-has-cratered-in-europe/?sh=31e2e2a36d7d). Left cites NIO’s 3% market share in China as a weakness, omitting the fact that only about a year or so ago, this figure was very close to zero. NIO is years behind Tesla in terms of production capacity; he’s comparing apples to oranges and he knows it.

In conclusion, Andrew Left’s $25 price target is clearly not based on numbers and calculations - it’s based on how much he wanted to profit off this squeeze, which was probably millions. Guy is a scumbag short seller abusing his power to manipulate the market and I hope the SEC takes a close look at him.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,559886,public,confidence,self,Citron’s NIO short report is fake news,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jtuqgh/citrons_nio_short_report_is_fake_news/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of MKSI's sales are derived from products sold to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers. The company's products are a key component in the chipmaking process. MKSI reports its results in three business segments: Vacuum and Analysis, Light and Motion, and Equipment and Solutions. 

MKSI has largely shrugged off factory constraints related to Covid-19, due to resilient demand in semiconductor markets. Power Solutions has remained particularly strong, led by pronounced demand for critical etch designs in V-NAND and DRAM. Performance in Advanced Markets has held up well, as growth in flexible PCB drilling applications have helped absorb soft industrial trends affected by government restrictions.

The most significant customers for MKSI are also the key players in the semiconductor industry. Lam Research, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, ASML Holdings, and Taiwan Semiconductors comprise a combined 38% of MKSI's revenue, and just shy of $750 billion in total market cap. These firms all have significant market share in the broader semiconductor industry and are on track to reap the demands foreseen in the coming decade as the world continues to increase its reliance on semiconductor products. Other notable customers of MKSI include Samsung, Intel, and IBM. From a geographical perspective, MKSI has significant exposure to emerging markets across Asia with 53% of their 2019 revenue coming from overseas. 

The biggest outside contributors include China, Germany, Israel, Japan and South Korea. Management believes revenue from the APAC region will continue to exceed other areas and bolster future revenue. 
The win of presidential nominee Joe Biden has signaled relief across the APAC markets that the trade war and tariffs being implemented against the region will be reversed and trade relations with the US will once again flourish. This war was the primary reason that the sector was crippled in 2018 as the White House rolled out trade tariffs against China, crippling operating margins and the supply chain and thus driving capital out of the market and into other places. 

The biggest growth driver for the tech sector in the coming years will be the implementation of 5G technology, and it has only just begun. 5G is a new technical standard for wireless networks that promises faster speeds and less lag when connecting to the network; and the ability to connect many devices to the internet without bogging it down. 5G networks will ideally be better able to handle more users, lots of sensors and heavy traffic. This new technology is not supported by previously existing infrastructure and will require a new generation of hardware, data centers and consumer products - the demand for which will be delivered primarily by the customers of MKS Instruments and thus by proxy MKS Instruments themselves.

# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.
*****
&gt; That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.
*****
&gt; In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&amp;P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.
*****
&gt; The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.
*****
&gt; # Next hurdle for market
&gt; “We largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Growth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That’s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it’s a long-term pivot point.”
*****
&gt; The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.
*****
&gt; Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.
*****
&gt; Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.
*****
&gt; # Value vs growth
&gt; Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.
*****
&gt; Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&amp;P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%
*****
&gt; “I think it’s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that’s driving a lot,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “When you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.”
*****
&gt; Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. “Some of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We’ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don’t think they’re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,” he said. “We just think there’s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It’s more a function of underperformance than decline.”

&gt; # A Very Good Ten

&gt; With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&amp;P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&amp;P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**

&gt; So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.

&gt; In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&amp;P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.

&gt; # November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Stronger

&gt; DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

&gt; # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But…

&gt; DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.

&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, –0.27% median loss.

&gt; This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

&gt; # New High in New 52 Week Highs

&gt; As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&amp;P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**

&gt; Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.

&gt; # Big Milestone For Small Stocks

&gt; No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**

&gt; In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.

&gt; # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention

&gt; Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&amp;P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress—a scenario that historically has produced solid S&amp;P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven’t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president’s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there’s new leadership. Of course, it’s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).

&gt; Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. “The S&amp;P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn’t happened since late 1982,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.” The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don’t anticipate this time being any different.

&gt; # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers

&gt; With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are up over 20% following today’s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.

&gt; In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**

&gt; Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year’s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.

&gt; # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election

&gt; For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**

&gt; The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.

&gt; # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar

&gt; Pfizer’s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the “go-to” positions throughout most of the pandemic.

&gt; The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today’s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.

&gt; Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.

Stocks rose today to recover most of Tuesday’s losses, with the indices looking to end the week on a high note. Overall, the major indices are still down overall this week, with market participants monitoring record increases in COVID-19 in the US and Europe, renewed stimulus concerns, and positive vaccine data.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.88% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.37% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.4% up. Overall, the three indices are red on the week.

Yesterday, sadly, the US set another record in daily new coronavirus cases, the eight record in the last ten days. On Thursday, the US recorded more than 153,000 new cases of coronavirus, up from 145,00 Wednesday and 110,000 at the beginning of the week. This week alone, the United States added more than 500,000 new cases (Our source for this data was is Johns Hopkins University). The number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is more than 66,000, also a record since the beginning of the pandemic. Infections are up across the board but states in the South and Midwest have been hit particularly hard. Texas surpassed 1 million cases this week, the first state to do so. North Dakota and Wisconsin have warned their hospitals are reaching capacity, with both State’s governors declaring a state of emergency. The rise in infections comes with new highs in the number of deaths reported in a single day, with more than 1,600 deaths on Wednesday. 

Europe continues to struggle with the surge in coronavirus, with France, the UK, Italy, Belgium, and others entering their second or third week of a second national lockdown. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that hospital capacity is filling up at an alarming rate. 

Today, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was pulling back from negotiating a new stimulus package. There will likely be no further stimulus until the new President is inaugurated on January 20, 2021.

Earlier in the week, hopes of market participants and the public overall were greatly raised by Pfizer’s (PFE) announcement that their clinical trial showed their vaccine candidate had a 90% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in participants with no evidence of a previous infection. However, optimism moderated after it became clear that even with approval, widespread distribution of the vaccine will be difficult and likely wouldn’t take place until 2021. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease expert in the United States, is optimistic that other companies will also report promising vaccine data soon

Analysts remain bullish about the reception of both devices in the short term, though the continued slump suggests overall market trends for the sector will not reverse.

Palantir missed on expectations but does it have a bright future? Let’s talk about it and some other stock market news

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with a recap of yesterday as we saw the hole stock market down with the Nasdaq dropping 0,6% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/1G8yCVK) , while the SP500 finished 1% down for the day but it’s still up for the week [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/r2C3qmb) as well as the Dow Jones which was also down more than 1% but its still up for the week [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/NykFwFg). The volatility index did see a small raise yesterday, but it’s still almost at the lowest point since the pandemic has started so I see this finally going down to pre-pandemic levels mid-late next year [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/rH0kWxc). Pretty much all of the stock market was down yesterday as you can see in both the SP500 heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/fYwprWZ) as well as the world heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/GVbPz88) with only small gains among a few companies, maybe the market has finally came around after the recent positive events like the Pfizer vaccine news and the positive US election results for the stock market and looked more closely to see that there is still a long period probably 3-6months at least of this pandemic affecting the economy as the US has seen a huge spike in cases in the last period with new daily cases and the 7-day average going almost parabolic [DAILY CASES](https://ibb.co/Z89p5KC), while the deaths have not seen a spike yet do to the better treatments available, this is expected to go up in the next weeks and months as the health care system will likely be to overcrowded. One other bad thing is that the positivity rate has also gone up from 4 to 5%in October to over 10% in the last days [POSITIVTY RATE](https://ibb.co/8rvLbsq). This is not just a US problem but a whole world problem as this has been going on around the world. [WORLD CASES](https://ibb.co/7j5TMqb)

So going back to the stock market yesterday we saw almost 3 quarters of companies declining as most of them are trading above the moving averages for 50 and 200 days  [CHART](https://ibb.co/y6099vP) while almost all sectors were dropping with the energy sector being the most punished with 2 thirds of the companies losing more than 2% [CHART](https://ibb.co/mN0My8g). The only companies with a little traction yesterday were growth and momentum stocks with large caps holding tight to hold the market as steady as possible.[CHART](https://ibb.co/Rg1yZfH)

Today we will see some economic data as producer prices for October are due as well as a preliminary consumer sentiment for November while the G-20 will also have a virtual meeting to discuss the debt burdens of the pandemic. Also, we will see some FED news coming in the early morning. Some good news would be welcomed as recent restrictions in Chicago and other places have seen the stock markets cool down. [FRIDAY EVENTS](https://ibb.co/k9tCTQJ)

Yesterday we saw the jobless claims number as it was way better than expected with just above 700 thousand claims almost 30 thousand better then expected and almost 50 thousand less than the previous number as well as a drop in continuing claims to under 7 million which was also better than expected. [JOBLESS NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/0Bp2Qyf)

Guys some IPO’s that have been delayed will probably finally launch as Companies like DoorDash and Airbnb are expected to finally arrive to the stock market [IPO's](https://ibb.co/HPH4M7V). I really like Airbnb an we could have it up for grabs at a discounted rate in this pandemic context. While InstaCart has seen a rise in valuation after the positive California vote for independent contractors. [INSTACART](https://ibb.co/58gNjQQ)

Also, one interesting earnings report for me today will be DraftKings as the are expected to lose around 63cents per share, if they improve on this the company will see a boost probably as the legalization of gambling in the US is evolving continually. [DRAFTKINGS](https://ibb.co/72Y5YnP)

While writing this post the earnings have already comed out [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/yfT14wR)

So, Disney released earnings yesterday and they beat expectations as the overall revenue declined 23% better than more than 26% that the analysts were estimating. They also beat expectations for earnings as the EPS was way better then expected [DISNEY EPS](https://ibb.co/QdMBP06). While the companies free cash flow more than doubled to over 900million$ [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/zNRcCXd) . Disney+ also has over 73 million subscribers far better than then 65million that the analysts expected while also ESPN+ subscribers outperformed by 1 million the expectations. This were very good numbers for the company but they do have to maintain this as the one-year trial for millions of Verizon customers for Disney+ expired Thursday. We will have to see what the retention rate is. [DISNEY+](https://ibb.co/W2TqF4W)

The other company that I was interested to see what they announce was Palantir as they missed EPS expectations by 77 cents but beat on revenue while also increasing guidance for the fiscal year [PALANTIR EPS](https://ibb.co/v448sMy) . The company added new contracts with the US army and the National Institutes of Health as well as renewing contract with an aerospace customer worth over 400 million combined. Though after excluding stock-based compensations and other IPO costs they had an adjusted operating income of over 70million$ which is great for the company as those were one-time costs that hugely impacted the earnings result. [PALANTIR FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/HGSg3Lm)

Other news came from PayPal as they will allow all US accounts to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies while also raising the weekly limit to 20 thousand $.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/4msPhXw)

Also, the new iPhone 12 seems to have good initial demand as it has been helped by carriers offering promotions to drive sales. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Jm9xkP4)

While Boeing looks to China for growth and recovery of the company as they expect China’s airlines to acquire planes valued at almost 1,5 trillion $ and services worth at least as much in the next 20 years. This would greatly help the struggling company to recover as the 737 max and the pandemic have hit them hard. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/x1GZmgJ)

So, let’s move on to my portfolio Guys Here is the complete structure of my portofolio as you can see I have 38% of it invested in companies that I have very high confidence in while 34,5% will be invested in companies that I also like but just a little bit less than the other. While on 23% of my portfolio will be invested in medium confidence companies with just 5% of that put into spec plays in my opinion. [PORTFOLIO](https://ibb.co/d4Y9Q0T)I am currently buying and constructing my portofolio to reach this levels, it will take a couple of months due to the fact the the minum trade size is 50$ on etoro so I need at least 10.000$ to reach this structure, until they i will slowly add to my position so that I reach my targets, first I will buy a 50$ stake in each one and that I will build it starting from the highest confidence to the lowest.

### Market Notes:

Yesterday markets sold off more than I expected. I'm questioning my bullish call at this point. Futures are up this morning so I'll keep a close watch. More selling and we could get a breakdown.

No surprises on new unemployment filings yesterday. 

Some of the President-Elect's advisors are recommending a 4-6 week shutdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. No indication from Biden if he will act on this. The inauguration is a long way off and we should know more about the vaccines by that point. Still, this adds a level of uncertainty.

It's Friday the 13th in 2020. Good luck everyone! After this profitable week I won't be over aggressive today.

Currently I'm not making a ton of money and I add maybe $200 - $400 bi-weekly to my investment account.

With that said, is it smart to sell stocks I'm currently seeing a loss on to get cash on hand to buy other stocks or is it typically better to wait until youre in the green (assuming that happens) and then sell?

Ex. I bought NFLX before earnings (not a huge mistake but im down about $200) and I know eventually NFLX should recover to above what I bought it for. However i have my eye on other stocks like NET that would probably net me a larger return if I just my NFLX shares and bought shares of NET.

Whats your advice for people in my situation? Is it best to sell as soon as you identify potentially better stocks or hold until you're green and then sell? Im not sure if this is a completely dumb question, even while writing it I realized how im potentially assuming every stock will eventually go up (thanks Dave Portnoy for giving me that idea) but im still curious to hear from more seasoned investors about what their best practice would be when struggling to gain funds.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,559298,public,confidence,self,Lack of Funds - Advice Needed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jtae56/lack_of_funds_advice_needed/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spreadsheet will take this information across 4 or 5 periods (Quarterly/Annually) and present them in a line chart format to easily visualize a company's growth. You can then compare this information with other similar companies, industry averages, and whatnot.

Here are the financial statements: [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/HYCzVWZ)

**Management Commentary**

*Overview*

Our growth and momentum across the business have continued.

We generated $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 52% from the third quarter of 2019, when we generated $190.5 million in revenue.

The demand for our software has increased steadily over the past year in the face of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the United States and abroad.

We are increasing our guidance for our full-year revenue in 2020 to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, which would represent a growth rate of 44% over the prior year, when we generated $743 million in revenue.

*Financial Results*

Our operating results have continued to show significant improvement.

In the third quarter of 2020, we generated revenue of $289.4 million, up 52% year-over-year, which is approximately $9 million above the high end of our prior guidance range.

We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

Our income from operations was $73.1 million when adjusting for $847.0 million in stock-based compensation, $20.2 million in related employer payroll taxes, and $53.7 million in expenses related to the listing.

The demand for our software from customers in both the commercial and government sectors has continued to increase this year.

In the three months ended September 30, 2020, we closed fifteen deals with new and existing customers, each worth $5 million or more in total contract value, including contracts with the U.S. Army and National Institutes of Health, as well as a contract renewal with one of the world’s largest aerospace companies worth $300 million in total contract value over five years.

The average revenue generated per customer through the first nine months of 2020 was $5.8 million, up from $4.2 million per customer, or 38%, from the same period the year before.

Our customer concentration is decreasing. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenue from our top twenty customers constituted 61% of our total revenue for the period, down from 68% in the first nine months of 2019.

We continue to have significant cash reserves. As of September 30, 2020, we had a total of cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion.

*Government*

The U.S. government sector remains a primary area of focus for our business.

Our work with healthcare organizations across the federal government has accelerated this year, and we continue to expand our reach with the nation’s defense and intelligence agencies, including the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.

In September 2020, we were selected among 999 bids for a two-year, $91 million contract with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to provide artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for military planning and defense operations.

Our work with partners across the U.S. federal government in responding to the coronavirus pandemic has increased significantly in recent months.

We were selected in September 2020 by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), a federal research organization based in Bethesda, Maryland, and operating under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), for a $36 million contract to provide our software to the agency for cancer and coronavirus research.

Our software is now being used for coronavirus response and research efforts by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a program run under the NIH that maintains the largest clinical data asset in the world regarding the development of the coronavirus. As part of the research effort, our software was used to integrate clinical data from more than one million patients in the United States in a matter of weeks.

The company’s efforts to assist foreign governments in their response to the coronavirus continues in countries around the world.

In the United Kingdom, for example, our software has been used by the National Health Service to allocate and distribute more than 2.7 billion items of personal protective equipment across the country.

*Commercial*

We are continuing to see significant momentum in our business across the commercial sector this year, both in the United States and abroad.

In September 2020, we closed a five-year contract renewal with a customer in the aerospace industry that is worth $300 million in total contract value, representing our largest ever contract in the commercial sector.

The lead time for customers to begin using our software has fallen sharply this year, and organizations continue to expand access to our platforms to users across their operations.

An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks of starting to use our platform.

The energy company identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities using our software, and the company’s management is currently targeting $1 billion in total savings in the coming year through the use of our platform.

Our software has also been used widely by customers across industries, including the automotive, manufacturing, aviation, healthcare, and banking sectors, to adjust their operations in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

A major consumer goods company in the United States recently turned to Palantir after an investment of more than one hundred million dollars in another enterprise software platform failed to produce results.

The customer began using our software within days to help address disruptions to its supply chain as a result of the pandemic. The company has since expanded its use of the platform to identify cost savings in raw material purchases across its business.

*International Expansion*

Our expansion in a number of markets abroad continues, including in Japan.

In June 2020, we selected Sompo Holdings, Inc., the Tokyo-based insurance company and Japan’s leading nursing care provider, as our strategic partner. The company is currently one of our most significant shareholders, following its approximately $500 million investment in Palantir this year.

“Sompo’s work is vital to Japan’s welfare and security, and Kengo Sakurada, the company’s group chief executive officer, has been a critical and trusted partner as we work with Sompo to expand our reach in Asia,” said Alexander C. Karp, co-founder and chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies Inc.

We believe that our market opportunity in Japan and the broader region will be significant over the long term.

Our expansion in Asia builds on our already significant presence outside North America, including in Europe, the Middle East, and increasingly South America.

*Financial Outlook*

We are increasing our revenue guidance for this year and now expect the business to generate a total of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion in annual revenue in 2020, up 44% year-over-year.

Our annual adjusted operating income in 2020 is expected to be $130 million to $136 million, which excludes stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to our direct listing.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect revenue of $299 million to $301 million, up 30% to 31% from last year, when we generated $229 million in revenue.

Our adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 is expected to be $44 million to $50 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes.

We continue to expect that year-over-year revenue growth in 2021 will be greater than 30%.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the non-GAAP financial measure income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to the direct listing.

We believe this non-GAAP financial measure helps us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting Palantir’s business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude expenses primarily related to the direct listing, as they are a one-time nonrecurring charge and employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of the control of the Company. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish this or similar metrics. Further, this metric has certain limitations, as it does not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measure income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to the direct listing should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

A reconciliation table of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as stock-based compensation, and related employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,559020,public,confidence,self,"Palantir Reports Revenue Growth of 52% in the Third Quarter, Raises Full-Year 2020 Guidance",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jt3aft/palantir_reports_revenue_growth_of_52_in_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stocks fell today, with the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 adding to yesterday’s losses with market participants closely monitoring the political situation in the US and a worsening virus situation despite positive vaccine data.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.46% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.93%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the worst, finishing 1.03% down.

Since Joe Biden’s victory on Saturday, President Trump has struck an increasingly defiant tone, refusing to concede the election and baselessly claiming widespread, national voter fraud in favor of the Democrats. Since then Trump filed a flurry of lawsuits against key states, alleging voter fraud. Most of these suits have been thrown out of Court for insufficient evidence. Moreover, Trump is purposefully blocking Biden from accessing key information needed for a smooth transition of power. 

Today, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was pulling back from negotiating a new stimulus package. There will likely be no further stimulus until a change in administration is made on January 20th. 

Sadly, this week alone, daily new coronavirus cases in the United States went from a little over 100,000 (a record at the time) to more than 145,000 cases as of Wednesday, a new record of daily cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has set a new number of daily infections every day this week, a very worrying sign. Hospitalizations are also on the rise, with the country recording record amounts of patients hospitalized with COVID the past two days, climbing from 61,964 on Tuesday to 65,368 on Wednesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. That’s double the number of hospitalizations compared to a month ago. North Dakota and Wisconsin have warned their hospitals are reaching capacity, with both State’s governors declaring a state of emergency. Texas became the first state to surpass 1 million cases of coronavirus. The rise in infections comes with new highs in the number of deaths reported in a single day at 1,549, the highest since May 14. Tennessee, Alabama and Minnesota all reached new highs in the number of deaths reported in a single day, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.

Earlier in the week, hopes of market participants and the public overall were greatly raised by Pfizer’s (PFE) announcement that their clinical trial showed their vaccine candidate had a 90% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in participants with no evidence of a previous infection. However, optimism moderated after it became clear that even with approval, widespread distribution of the vaccine wouldn’t take place until 2021.

Amazon is becoming more popular among people who use food stamps for online grocery orders, according to a recent report.

In fact, online grocery orders for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) users have spiked 50-fold this year because of the pandemic, according to a report from Bloomberg.

In September, 1.1 million people used their SNAP benefits to buy food online -- with most of those people shopping from Amazon and Walmart.

This is a positive sign for amazon stock. It is showing people are more conveniently spending their food stamps to purchase groceries from amazon.

Hey everyone and Welcome to my channel, so let’s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday As the Nasdaq bounced back with a jump of 2% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/DVfGGSL) while the S&amp;P followed the lead and rose 0,7% [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/LzJNVLQ) while the Dow finally took a breather and was barely down for the day [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/K9pPfJ2). The volatility index continued to drop past that level of 25 for the first time since the last 2 months [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/CV3JBkG). Yesterday we saw pretty much an even market as the advancing to declining stocks were even while 78 made new high and just 12 made new lows. The volume finally slowed down a little after the huge first 2 days of trading this week due to the Pfizer vaccine news [ADVANCING](https://ibb.co/VCdkLBK). We saw tech with over 45% and consumer discretionary with over 25% of the companies up more than 2% to put them back on track while there were no obvious losers energy and industrial did take a break from the huge run they had [CHART](https://ibb.co/mtrP7gQ). We also saw momentum and growth stocks outperform the value plays as well as small caps and dividend plays especially with large caps leading the way [CHART](https://ibb.co/fFzQ7xB).As some pandemic favorites have return to flavor for investors with the likes of Zoom, Shopify and other being up from they’re lows.

We have to be vey aware of the stock market as investors have made a huge sentiment shift as we saw a jump of 18% in bullish investors and a decline of almost 7% in bearish as we are way above historical averages [INVESTORS SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/CtZfLPP). This usually is a bad contrarian indicator for the market as the time to invest is usually when other people are scared or afraid to put money in the stock market. We could potentially see a correction of the stock market especially with cases rising of Covid-19 and with the number of deaths trailing this by about a month, we could see huge numbers that could scare investors in the next month or so. Add to this the volatility that is expected to arrive around the Georgia runoff election this is a serios thing to consider. It may be better to wait for the next correction to put money into the stock market. Here is a chart of the SP500 and the VIX being inversely corelated as you can see whenever he vix sees a spike the sp goes down but with every even that caused volatility the market has recovered and has made new highs after that. [VIX to SP](https://ibb.co/wsXZG92)

Before this next point I have to tell you that I have no partisan view as I am not a resident or citizen of the US. So though already announced by many as the next President, Biden win % as dropped slightly after the first days of the election results this probably is due to the fact that Trump is not willing to concede and continues with his legal ballots [BIDEN %](https://ibb.co/ZTvYnZL), so I don’t think this will lead to anything and expect Biden to take-over in January but the more important thing for the stock market investors is that big changes are very unlikely as the Senate has a more than 80% chance of being controlled by the Republicans [SENATE RACE](https://ibb.co/99KXKyN) which will likely deny any chances for the Democrats to raise any taxes or to do any radical left ideas. So, this bolds very well as the stock market loves the most that things don’t change to often and it also loves to not have unknowns.

So, Moderna also has announced that they will soon publish the vaccine study for they’re candidate [MODERNA NEWS](https://ibb.co/SKxWZCn), if we do see great results in this vaccine I believe the market will react very good to the news, as every new vaccine can take us higher as a whole market especially led by the SP and the Dow Jones. As there has been some doubt to the Pfizer vaccine as the CEO sold more than 5 million $ worth of stock on the same day they made the announcement even if it was a scheduled sale this has made people have some doubts about the results [CEO SALE](https://ibb.co/d5Lvsnq). So as you can see the next results that we are expecting for vaccines candidates are from Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&amp;J and Novavax. I believe the next 3 will be pretty important for a better market outlook. [NEXT VACCINES](https://ibb.co/LQ9nCV1)

Also, other good news came from the UK as they save a growth of more than 15% in the 3rd quarter, though the economy is still down more than 8% from before the pandemic this seems to be a good recovery track that has been unfortunately derailed a little probably with the latest lockdown in the UK. [UK ECONOMY](https://ibb.co/G99q89g)

While Goldman just raised the price target for the SP by 100points for year end as they expect to see a huge growth next year of better than 1000points from where the SP sits now [NEWS](https://ibb.co/bmWhcSR)

Today we have some interesting earnings results with the ones that I will watch most being Disney and Palantir as the analysts estimate a loss of 70 cents vs a more than 1$ profit just a year ago for Disney [DISNEY EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/Ctv0gqn) . But the more important aspect to watch I believe is how well or bad Disney+ is doing, if they deliver another great round of subscriber growth this will be a huge positive for the company which has seen it’s parks revenue plunge with the pandemic this year with lots of jobs being cut that did eventually help with lowering the costs for the company.

While Walmart just announced that they will test driverless delivery next year, this could be a huge cost saver for the biggest employer in the US. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/7KpkWGB)

Also, Roku just announce that they will add apple airplay support to the system with added benefits for HBO Max users, this continues to improve the product and service Roku provide, as I expect them to continue to expand as traditional cable TV is a dying business. [ROKU NEWS](https://ibb.co/ZxwVPTK)

Great news for car companies and EV companies from China as they announced a rise of over 10% in October as the pandemic eases overseas. With passenger vehicles sales rising by 9% while EV’s and plug-in sales increase to 160.000 thousand, this are great news for companies like General Motors, Tesla and others.

### Market Notes:

S&amp;P 500 is moving up slowly as the markets settle back down after a wild start to the week. The VIX continues to fall which is a positive sign for the bulls.

Futures are down slightly this morning as we appear to be inching towards a record high close. I expect a new record close by end of next week maybe sooner.

Goldman Sachs has increased its end of year expectations for the markets and is projecting a strong year in 2021 too.

I'm taking the trades as they come, small gains add up. I'm still bullish and believe we will continue to rally into the end of the year.

Hey everyone and Welcome to my channel, so let’s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday As the Nasdaq bounced back with a jump of 2% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/DVfGGSL)  while the S&amp;P followed the lead and rose 0,7% [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/LzJNVLQ) while the Dow finally took a breather and was barely down for the day [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/K9pPfJ2). The volatility index continued to drop past that level of 25 for the first time since the last 2 months [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/CV3JBkG). Yesterday we saw pretty much an even market as the advancing to declining stocks were even while 78 made new high and just 12 made new lows. The volume finally slowed down a little after the huge first 2 days of trading this week due to the Pfizer vaccine news [ADVANCING](https://ibb.co/VCdkLBK). We saw tech with over 45% and consumer discretionary with over 25% of the companies up more than 2% to put them back on track while there were no obvious losers energy and industrial did take a break from the huge run they had [CHART](https://ibb.co/mtrP7gQ). We also saw momentum and growth stocks outperform the value plays as well as small caps and dividend plays especially with large caps leading the way [CHART](https://ibb.co/fFzQ7xB).As some pandemic favorites have return to flavor for investors with the likes of Zoom, Shopify and other being up from they’re lows.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qk5hRVk)

We have to be vey aware of the stock market as investors have made a huge sentiment shift as we saw a jump of 18% in bullish investors and a decline of almost 7% in bearish as we are way above historical averages [INVESTORS SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/CtZfLPP). This usually is a bad contrarian indicator for the market as the time to invest is usually when other people are scared or afraid to put money in the stock market. We could potentially see a correction of the stock market especially with cases rising of Covid-19 and with the number of deaths trailing this by about a month, we could see huge numbers that could scare investors in the next month or so. Add to this the volatility that is expected to arrive around the Georgia runoff election this is a serios thing to consider. It may be better to wait for the next correction to put money into the stock market. Here is a chart of the SP500 and the VIX being inversely corelated as you can see whenever he vix sees a spike the sp goes down but with every even that caused volatility the market has recovered and has made new highs after that. [VIX to SP](https://ibb.co/wsXZG92)

Before this next point I have to tell you that I have no partisan view as I am not a resident or citizen of the US. So though already announced by many as the next President, Biden win % as dropped slightly after the first days of the election results this probably is due to the fact that Trump is not willing to concede and continues with his legal ballots [BIDEN %](https://ibb.co/ZTvYnZL), so I don’t think this will lead to anything and expect Biden to take-over in January but the more important thing for the stock market investors is that big changes are very unlikely as the Senate has a more than 80% chance of being controlled by the Republicans [SENATE RACE](https://ibb.co/99KXKyN) which will likely deny any chances for the Democrats to raise any taxes or to do any radical left ideas. So, this bolds very well as the stock market loves the most that things don’t change to often and it also loves to not have unknowns.

So, Moderna also has announced that they will soon publish the vaccine study for they’re candidate [MODERNA NEWS](https://ibb.co/SKxWZCn), if we do see great results in this vaccine I believe the market will react very good to the news, as every new vaccine can take us higher as a whole market especially led by the SP and the Dow Jones. As there has been some doubt to the Pfizer vaccine as the CEO sold more than 5 million $ worth of stock on the same day they made the announcement even if it was a scheduled sale this has made people have some doubts about the results [CEO SALE](https://ibb.co/d5Lvsnq). So as you can see the next results that we are expecting for vaccines candidates are from Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&amp;J and Novavax. I believe the next 3 will be pretty important for a better market outlook. [NEXT VACCINES](https://ibb.co/LQ9nCV1)

Also, other good news came from the UK as they save a growth of more than 15% in the 3rd quarter, though the economy is still down more than 8% from before the pandemic this seems to be a good recovery track that has been unfortunately derailed a little probably with the latest lockdown in the UK. [UK ECONOMY](https://ibb.co/G99q89g)

While Goldman just raised the price target for the SP by 100points for year end as they expect to see a huge growth next year of better than 1000points from where the SP sits now [NEWS](https://ibb.co/bmWhcSR)

Today we have some interesting earnings results with the ones that I will watch most being Disney and Palantir as the analysts estimate a loss of 70 cents vs a more than 1$ profit just a year ago for Disney [DISNEY EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/Ctv0gqn) . But the more important aspect to watch I believe is how well or bad Disney+ is doing, if they deliver another great round of subscriber growth this will be a huge positive for the company which has seen it’s parks revenue plunge with the pandemic this year with lots of jobs being cut that did eventually help with lowering the costs for the company.

While Walmart just announced that they will test driverless delivery next year, this could be a huge cost saver for the biggest employer in the US. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/7KpkWGB)

Also, Roku just announce that they will add apple airplay support to the system with added benefits for HBO Max users, this continues to improve the product and service Roku provide, as I expect them to continue to expand as traditional cable TV is a dying business. [ROKU NEWS](https://ibb.co/ZxwVPTK)

Great news for car companies and EV companies from China as they announced a rise of over 10% in October as the pandemic eases overseas. With passenger vehicles sales rising by 9% while EV’s and plug-in sales increase to 160.000 thousand, this are great news for companies like General Motors, Tesla and others.

Take for example SDIV.  Global X Super Dividend ETF.   There is a yahoo finance article saying that its annual yield is 9.09%.  And its distribution yield according to the fidelity platform is 10.97%. With TTM in parenthesis.  Whatever that means and the difference between the two I do not know?

Now I realize that I am not going to get rich off of 10% per year, but in an uncertain market, this seems like a pretty safe and reasonable investment for most people who are not active traders but looking to park their money somewhere.  However I realize there must be more to it than that and I am hoping you can educate me.  Everything has a risk and nothing is a sure thing Some further questions to help me expand my knowledge overall if you don't mind me asking.

I get that ETF's are supposed to be more liquid than mutual funds and there is heavier trading volume.  I get that the managers of SDIV choose to invest in about 100 different companies that issue dividends.

Consider the following example and if you could correct my assumptions as to where I am wrong that will help me get a better understanding.

\-I presume that the 9.09% or 10.97% (whichever one is more accurate) annual yield number is backwards looking.  That is likely what they ended up returning to a client last year?  There is no guarantee that it will equal future performance correct?  And that was likely based on the basket of 100+ companies in their holding.  But these mega companies do not decide to do big changes to their divided amounts of a very short timeframe.  They likely meet quarterly or yearly and discuss if their will be changes to their dividends.  And probably by only a few small percentage points at a time?  

My point is, that 10% yield to round it, is not a very volatile number.  It may trend higher or lower over the course of a year, but it does not make daily swings?

\-They are currently trading around 12 dollars to round it to the nearest number.  Let's say that I invest 100K.  And the fund returns a 10% annual yield, but stays trading at 12 dollars.  Does the mean over the course of a year I get an extra $10K.  Is that 10K deposited as cash into my primary trading account?  Is it automatically reinvested into the fund?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Let's say that I invest 100K into the ETF at $12 dollars and hold onto it for a year and it goes up to trading at 24 dollars.  Does that mean your initial investment of 100K is now up to 200K and then the 10% annual yield on top of that?  So more like 100K is now worth 210K?  

&amp;#x200B;

\-Lets say that I invested 100K back in March when it was up near 18$ before the SHTF with covid.  Now its trading price has decreased to around 12 dollars.  It is down roughly 33%.  Does that mean your annual 10% yields is based off of 66K?  Or are you still getting 10% annual yields off your initial 100K, however if you sold the ""principal"" you would only get 66K back?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, help me understand in greater detail how these investments work and the risks.

There must be demand for the company’s products. Nike’s been creating demand for decades, thanks to the “cool factor” supported by sharp advertising and clothing that looks good, feels comfortable and lets everyone know you’re an athlete.

The company’s total addressable market. In other words, how big the market is for its products. Cramer also likes to know where it sits in the pecking order. Nike is the dominant player in footwear and number two in apparel.

Are there any catalysts that can power the stock higher? Nike has several catalysts, like the Summer Olympics.

Other ways to look into the future. Nike has a company-specific key metric called future orders, which allows customers to order merchandise six months ahead.

The company’s ability to pass costs onto the customers. Nike made it clear in the conference call that it had no trouble passing on raw costs through price increases, Cramer said.

It’s important to understand the geographic breakdown of the business. Nike’s fastest growing geographies are emerging markets, which is up 26 percent year-over-year. China is up 28 percent and the U.S. is up 21 percent. Western Europe and Japan are still challenging environments, but they’re offset by the strength elsewhere.

Wall Street loves accelerating revenue growth. Nike has this across multiple product categories in both developed and developing markets.

Inventory. When companies with retail components have too much inventory, it can be a problem since they’ll have to discount the older products before bringing in a new product. Nike’s unit inventory growth outpaced its sales growth, but since absolute unit levels have ""plateaued,"" Cramer is not concerned.

Good companies are always reinventing themselves and their products. Nike is doing this, Cramer said, with new technology in its shoes and marketing.

Company culture. Nike is focused on improving the way they work. This is the least important item.

When Jim Cramer worked at his hedge fund, he asked analysts the following eight questions:

No. 1: What's goingto make this stock go up, besides the stock market?

No. 2: Why is it going to go up? Is there something time sensitive?

No. 3: Is this the best time to buy it?

No. 4: Have you missed a lot of the move? How much has the stock gone up without you? Is it extended on a technical basis?

No. 5: Should you wait until it comes down a bit more? What's the harm?

No. 6: What do you know about this stock that others are missing? Is your instinct to buy based on general knowledge, and you're working on a herd mentality? Have you listened to the conference calls and done the research, or are you flying blind?

No. 7: What do you actually know about the company and sector? Do you have personal knowledge? Do you know how the cloud works, what stock trades with what, or where it lies in the sector’s food chain?

No. 8: Do you like this stock more than others you own and why?

Stocks rose today as tech shares recovered some of their recent declines. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around a coronavirus vaccine and other treatments. The Nasdaq (QQQ outperformed the market, finishing 2.24% up. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.76% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed, finishing 0.1% down.

This week, so-called reopening stocks, like cruise-lines, airlines, hotels, and brick-and-mortar stores rallied on the backs of Pfizer’s vaccine announcement. Hopes that drug-makers are closing in on developing and getting approval for a coronavirus vaccine stoked consumer confidence in getting out and traveling. 

The jump in reopening stocks came at the expense of tech stocks that have so far greatly outperformed the broader market throughout the pandemic. This week, the Nasdaq posted back-to-back declines of more than 1% before today while the Dow Jones gained around 4%. Same story in the S&amp;P 500, where financials, industrial, and energy sectors have outperformed tech this week, after greatly lagging year-to-date. Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors said, “Investors have gotten a lot more comfortable with the election outcome, with progress on COVID-19 solutions, and what again was a very solid earnings season. So I think they’re looking ahead to 2021 and anticipating, perhaps, much better-than-expected economic growth and earnings growth. And so they’re pivoting towards more cyclical, value companies and a bit away from the technology.”

This week, a number of notable analysts upgraded their near-term expectations for the market. Goldman Sachs (GS) raised their year-end price target for the S&amp;P 500 from 3600 to 3700 and to climb to 4300 by the end of 2021. JP Morgan (JPM) also raised their estimates, placing a price target of 3600 by year-end and 4,000 by early next year, with the potential to then rise further to 4,500 by the end of 2021. JP Morgan analysts said, “After a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, US election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing up.”

**Highlights**

* GrowGeneration (GRWG) going off like a rocket after-hours. This is one stock we love and have repeatedly recommended,

This will be an updated post and in-depth breakdown for the Dividend Growth strategy. It is important to understand how companies need to be evaluated differently based on the investment philosophy you are pursuing. Now, investing in a dividend growth strategy takes time and patience, depending on your income goal, it can take awhile before a dividend portfolio can fully support enough cash flow to sustain your lifestyle without you needing to rely on a full-time or part-time job. But that is the exciting part, once you have enough income from the dividends you can retire or work a job that you perhaps find more exciting?\n\n# The Strategy:\n\nThe dividend growth strategy is focused on building up a portfolio of high quality companies that not only pay out a dividend, but have regularly been increasing the dividend payout. The end goal is to create passive income to live off the increasing dividend payouts. So the focus is placed more on the cash flow for wealth rather than the stock appreciation (appreciation is just an added bonus).\n\nNOTE: **Dividend yield is not main focus.** A common misconception is that a very high dividend yield is the most important measure, however, a yield that is considerably higher similar stocks in the same industry may indicate not a good dividend but rather a depressed price due to company issues. This price may signal an eventual dividend cut or elimination if the situation continues. Most dividend ETFs will filter out the top percentage of dividends yields for this reason.\n\nThe strategy here is on the **dividend growth**. If a company increases their payout overtime it is going to have an insane snowball effect when the dividends are reinvested (kinda like the snowball effect for paying off debt). Dividend growth investing uses the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends into the same investment to increase your future dividend payments. With each reinvestment, your shares grow slightly larger. With slightly more shares, your next dividend payment is slightly larger. With enough time invested in solid companies, the growth effect is amazing. This is why dividend growers are so important, they add more fuel to this compounding effect!\n\nIf you really want to see this effect visualized, check out the charts for Warren Buffets wealth. In 2018 alone, Berkshire raked in **$3.8 billion** in dividends – “a sum that will increase in 2019,” Buffett said in the annual letter. The great majority of the stocks in Berkshire\'s portfolio are dividend stocks. And many of those stock are growing their dividend.\n\n# Evaluating Companies for this Strategy:\n\nSince the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:\n\n* Dividend payout ratio:\n   * Dividend payouts less than 50%-75% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable.\n   * Does the company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term?\n* Dividend Yield:\n   * Ensure the company is paying a dividend and that the dividend yield isn\'t too low to start.\n   * Watch out for dividend traps! Extremely high dividend yield for non-REITs can often signal an unsustainable payout! Look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (Do research after this ofcourse, this doesn\'t immediately mean it is healthy)\n* Dividend Growth Rate\n   * Look for companies that increase their dividend payout year after year.\n* Free Cash Flow to Equity:\n   * This is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. If a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.\n* Debt to EBITDA ratio (Earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)\n   * A company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. See AT&amp;T vs Verizon!\n\nNOTE: The companies are often broken into these categories based on how long they have increased their dividend:\n\n* Challenger: 5+ years\n* Contender: 10-24 years\n* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years\n* King: 50+ years\n\nThere are ofcourse many other factors. Consider the business, does it have a sustainable model (Coca-Cola &amp; Pepsi)? Is its market shrinking (See oil companies)? Do you like the company and management?? For this type of investing (any type really), you need to know what you are investing into!\n\n# Where to Start and Key Things:\n\nMany of the companies that should be looked for are ones we all recognize because they are so well established and have very wide market exposure. They have incredible staying power for these reasons, and very often have enough money to expand into new markets to remain relevant. This is their significant advantage over startups (many of which they just buy up anyways)\n\nLet\'s take PEPSI for example. Pepsico (NYSE: PEP) is a company in the Consumer Defensive Sector, its wide variety of iconic brands and products give it a very large global moat.\n\n* Current Dividend Ratio:  2.89% (November 2020 based on share price of $141.75)\n* Current Annual Dividend Payout:  $4.09\n* Average 3 Year Dividend Growth Rate -  **8.60%**\n\nLooking at this we can see that PEPSI is not only paying a very nice dividend, but it is increasing it at an average of 8%! So even if you don\'t buy more shares of the stock it will start to pay you more each year just for holding it. The next step from here would be to look into the financials. Essenitally we are just checking to ensure they are not burdened with too much debt, have sharply decreasing revenue, or payouts that exceed their current cashflow.\n\nOther companies that would be good examples (just a few)\n\n* AAPL - Apple - Challenger - IT\n* MSFT - Microsoft - Contender - IT\n* JPM - JPMorgan Chase - Challenger - Financial\n* VZ - Verizon - Contender - Telecommunications\n* JNJ - Johnson and Johnson - King - Healthcare\n* MMM - 3M - King - Industrials\n* IBM - International Business Machines - Aristocrat - IT\n* KO - Coca-Cola - King - Consumer Defensive\n\nETFs are an excellent option, however due the large difference in strategies amoung them they will have to be discussed in a separate post. However some notable ones include: NOBL, SCHD, VYM, VIG, DGRO, and DRGW. (Amoung many many others)\n\n# Advantages and Disadvantages of this Strategy:\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Dividends are not always guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends due to financial pressure. At any moment, companies can decrease their dividend payout or completely get rid of it. **However, many of the companies on the Dividends list maintained and increased their dividends during this time, this highlights the importance of investing in quality companies.**\n* Unless you are holding these stocks in an IRA you will pay taxes on them.\n* When compared to index investing it decreases diversification since you\'re really only invested into more “large cap” stocks. You\'ll be missing out on the mid-cap and small-cap stocks\n* Some say dividend payouts of the sign of a dying company. For some perhaps this is true, however a strong counter argument is this. If a company is well established and the payout for moving into a new market sector, or a new acquisition wouldn\'t be favorable, a company can instead payout dividends to entice investors rather than potentially sacrifice company value just in the name of potential growth.\n* You have to pay more attention to the companies you are investing into to ensure they remain healthy and can continue to grow and increase their dividend.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* **Reinvesting dividends during sideways moving markets, bear markets, and corrections, purchase more shares with the dividend while the prices are lower. Later, when prices recover, the return is actually enhanced by the temporary fall in the stock price. Reinvesting dividends and accumulating more shares during corrections and bear markets greatly boosts dividend growth investing returns in the long run. This is a significant advantage of dividend stocks over growth stocks in less than ideal market conditions.**\n* Historically dividends have provided 43% of the S&amp;P 500 total return from 1930 - 2017 (according to Blackrock). Dividends provide an ongoing return while waiting for capital appreciation.\n* The snowball effect of dividend growth compounding can provide competitive returns regardless of whether the price of the stock increases in value or not.\n* Creating passive income and preserving capital. Like all stocks they are an excellent hedge against inflation.\n\n# Performance &amp; Final Thoughts:\n\nIt depends on what timeframe you are looking at, if say we take from December 1999 - 2017 the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 3.37% per year. But if we take other timeframes then the S&amp;P500 is dominant. Beating the S&amp;P500 over the long term is near impossible, but **beating the S&amp;P isn\'t the goal of this strategy**. This strategy is focused on passive income generation. Imagine if checks were rolling in every week during the COVID lockdowns even if you weren\'t working?\n\nPlease supplement this post with your own research. Compare this strategy to general index investing and growth investing. Find what is right for you.\n\nThe hope is this post provided insight into this strategy and evaluating dividend paying companies.\n\nThankyou for taking the time to read!\n\nThere are many other sources to learn more about dividend focused strategies, in the brand new **Moderator\'s Collection** for the sub there is a post titled "" **My Complete Guide to Dividend Investing""** written by  [u/Interriuso](https://www.reddit.com/user/Interriuso/), it holds an incredible amount of useful links and information.

This could be a novel. If anyone would like some more info on anything, just let me know. But summary wise, I have been in restaurant IT for 20+ years. COVID, yeah COVID, don't need to go more into that.

There's a company you may or may not heard of. It's called SinglePlatform. When you google/search whatever restaurant you want (I'm talking a local, not McDonalds etc) odds are when you find a ""menu"" the data is aggregated by SP. Why does this matter? They have had total dominance for years. 

I could tangent off on how they are a few curly ones shy of straight up extortion (Bottom line, they may aggregate some old menu data, publish it, which then gets scraped by EVERY site, TraipAdvisor, Yelp, Google, and the 100x smaller guys) If that information isn't correct. You're restaurant will suffer. I guess, you will just have to take my word on this, unless you happen to know someone in my field. I have / do work at about 15 locations, all locals. No chains.

Why does any of this matter? Well, a long time back (april), I was on-boarding another restaurant management group into my company. At the time, I only worked for 1 company. Knowing how good SP is, I pushed to have it adopted. Went to the site, saw the price, and HOLY HELL. I know I'm not paying that much at said previous company.

OK. So. This is where it gets fun. SINCE April, I have been trying to setup a reseller account. More or less, I get subscriptions at a discount, I up charge and re-sell to my customers, and provide support. Now, when this first began. I saw they had some very new features I was not aware of. One of which, was integrating DoorDash, GrubHub, Uber Eats, pick your poison delivery service into one central panel. This management set, would be a HOLY GRAIL for me. I inquired about this, since as I said, this would be a GAME CHANGER if we had that kind of management. I was told ""yeah... it ""works"" but don't get your hopes up"" or something to that effect. Sounded like they gave it a shot, but weren't getting far.

There are a lot of ""M""s in SMB. Generally speaking, you probably won't have these kind of issues if you have 1 location, or 100. But when you're in the middle, the ""small"" options (Just speaking on SaaS etc) are too small, and the Big options, massive overkill and un-affordable.

Everything was going great. Then, degradation. Couldn't get in touch with my rep, company seemed chaotic. Emails, calls, all go dark. Eventually. I come to find TripAdvisor acquired SP. With this, the delivery integration, gone. They just dumped it.

Now lets swing this all back around to this week. I took $TRIP at the bottom, I had been fishing for a deal on them COVID or not. I had a feeling they would preform. Since obvious hotels etc, are not on the horizon (I have some contacts in these areas, (and just to be extra clear, everything I am posting is public knowledge)), it seemed logical to me for them to pivot and focus on restaurants.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought / Theory #1. They dumped the integration because the coding logistics, are a lot. I mean a LOT. (PM me if you're proficient at things like puppet etc, experience with buy bots would be a plus)

Thought Theory #2. Acquire. Generally speaking, I think each city to sity, state to state, region to region, whatever delivery service ""you"" use, may not be the same for me / someone else. For example, uber eats is a total joke in my city. Complete waste of time and money to even bother with them. Maybe they are the go-to for you? That's my only point on that. 

Leaving this here.

Alibaba set a new sales record for the annual Singles Day shopping event.

Singles Day is typically a 24-hour shopping event that takes place on Nov. 11 in China, but this year Alibaba and JD.com began their huge discounts from Nov. 1.

Alibaba said gross merchandise value (GMV) surpassed 372.3 billion yuan ($56.42 billion) as of 12:30 a.m. Beijing time on Wednesday. That figure is not final.

But Alibaba and JD.com's stocks plunged after Beijing released draft rules on Tuesday that, for the first time, defines what constitutes anti-competitive behavior.

Hey everyone and Welcome, let’s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday

As we saw a continuing of the same market trading as Monday as the Dow gained almost 1% [CHART](https://ibb.co/1z2DXMT), while the Nasdaq was punished again down more than 1,3% [CHART](https://ibb.co/k8hJGQf) while the broader stock market in the SP finished flat for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/bR3yw5L)

We saw 2 thirds of the market advancing with 77 new highs and 15 new lows while the volume continued to be above average for the second straight day [CHART](https://ibb.co/jfMb5G8) as investors are shifting portfolios more to the value plays. As we saw energy lead the way with 61% of energy companies advancing more than 2% as well as more than 50% of companies from consumer staples and industrials also advancing more than 2% for the day while the laggards were consumer discretionary and technology with more than 20% of the companies being down more than 2% for the day [CHART](https://ibb.co/LhjWFR0) with many internet retails companies selling off again like fiver jd.com , Etsy eBay, Shopify and others including Amazon. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/fxzG9m5)

The market was led again by small caps as well as value and high dividend plays while growth and momentum companies were down again. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9HcqktG)

Here is the heat map for the S&amp;P500 [MAP](https://ibb.co/DG8f1JW) where you can see most of the big tech companies as well of most of the credit services were down. While the broader market map shows the transition to energy plays as well as industrials [MAP](https://ibb.co/vz48M8g). Whereas tech companies like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft extended losses from Monday this dragged the Nasdaq Index down.

The volatility index maintained steady at the 25 level slightly lower than yesterday but keeping that support line that will be maintained for a period in my opinion [VIX](https://ibb.co/3MmwnjF) with the VIX withstanding the huge market volume from Monday, as early data from Reuters shows that there were nearly 2 trillion $ being exchanged [NEWS](https://ibb.co/xMNCPNz) as value stocks had the best one-day performance against growth stocks ever in the US as brokers worldwide had problems handling this huge volume of trading with companies like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Charles Schwab experiencing issues. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Xx1dwpG)

So, democrats have clinched House control but they really disappointed expectations as they were expecting to gain even more seats as much as 15 but this has moved to a loss of seats that stand at 6 and counting at the moment. This has completed 2 thirds of the best results the stock market was expecting with only the Senate being up for grabs at the beginning of January. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qCkzY3x)

Today there are not many events in the economic calendar as only Mortgage Applications number are expected, as the bond markets are also closed for Veterans day, stocks will see most of the trading today.

Yesterday Apple launched the first MacBook laptops with the in-house built processor, this will move closer the Mac and iPhone as they will both have the Apple processors from now, cutting they tie the company had with Intel that bad provided them for almost 15 years. The new Macs seem to have huge improvements in performance and battery life. This will likely be a boost to the addressable market of the Macs as they will address the people who need big performance in they’re computers as well as people who are looking for good cheap computer as the new Mac Mini desktop is 100$ cheaper than the previous version. This will be a more than 15 billion addressable market for Apple as they continue to improve products and services all the time. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/RHsDQx6)

Boeing announced that they have lost another 12 orders for the 737 MAX and delivered just 13 aircrafts, the delivery number is down from 20 aircrafts in the same month from a year ago. So they have only delivered 111 aircrafts this year a huge decrease from 321 just a year ago in the same period. [BOEING NEWS](https://ibb.co/HTZSB94)

The stock has seen a surge of more than 30% as people are rushing back to own the stocks after positive news on the ending of the 737 max grounding as well as the vaccine news.

This was also helped by the fact that the just secured worth almost 10 billion $ with the Air Force. [BOEING CONTRACT](https://ibb.co/6vRFGjF)

Alibaba just announced that orders made on its e-commerce platform during the Singles Day event have exceeded 56 billion $ by today as consumers are still splashing out money on buying products online. Singles day is the world’s biggest sales event eclipsing both Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the US combined as it stretches over 4 main days this year. They have received more than 16 times the orders that Amazon received last month in its two-day Prime event. This are finally some good news for the company as it has lost almost 76 billion $ of it’s market value after the suspension of Ant Group IPO which they own about a third of. I believe this will be a great opportunity to buy the stocks as it is way down from its highs. Ant Group will eventually file and have they’re IPO in the next year which will boost the stock up once again even if it will be at a much lower valuation for the company. [ALIBABA NEWS](https://ibb.co/JFBvPV7)

Some other news interesting news is that Airbnb has delayed the documents release for the IPO, as they decided to delay these more from the US elections. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0JKW0wD)

Also, Uber is expected to close a deal worth more than 2,5 billion $ after the DOJ has cleared the way [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Tkbx1FN)

While Ford is moving more and more to address the EV market as they are expected to release a lot of EV models starting next year. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qxNmdyT)

While the jobs openings from September has seen a revision that moves it closer to the 6,5 million that where expected as the job openings rate was more than double the quits rate. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zFrrpsZ)

This as the small business optimism was flat last month a lower value than was expected but the same as September [NEWS](https://ibb.co/RjgKNLw) pretty much in line with TD’s Investor movement that was flat also in the last month. [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/X2fv359)

So, I believe great times are ahead as do many of the investors as a post-election poll shows that over 60% expect a positive return next year. But be aware any derailments or delays of the vaccines may bring more volatility to the stock market. [POLL](https://ibb.co/SxqtQSL)

### Market Notes:

The Supreme Court heard arguments about Obamacare yesterday. Despite the overwhelming conservative majority on the court signaled a reluctance to strike it down. I noticed more healthcare stocks on my scanner too. I believe the market is pricing in no rule changes.

The Dow, Nasdaq, &amp; S&amp;P 500 are all move in unison in the premarket. This after several days of mixed markets they are beginning to sync back up. At writing, markets were up about \~1%.

Things appeared to settle down yesterday after a crazy day on Monday. I believe we are going to pick up the bull run into the end of the year from here.

Unless the Trump campaign makes some headway in the courts we have little political uncertainty remaining and a vaccine on the way.

Hey everyone and Welcome, let’s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday 

As we saw a continuing of the same market trading as Monday as the Dow gained almost 1% [CHART](https://ibb.co/1z2DXMT), while the Nasdaq was punished again down more than 1,3% [CHART](https://ibb.co/k8hJGQf) while the broader stock market in the SP finished flat for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/bR3yw5L)

We saw 2 thirds of the market advancing with 77 new highs and 15 new lows while the volume continued to be above average for the second straight day [CHART](https://ibb.co/jfMb5G8) as investors are shifting portfolios more to the value plays. As we saw energy lead the way with 61% of energy companies advancing more than 2% as well as more than 50% of companies from consumer staples and industrials also advancing more than 2% for the day while the laggards were consumer discretionary and technology with more than 20% of the companies being down more than 2% for the day [CHART](https://ibb.co/LhjWFR0)  with many internet retails companies selling off again like fiver jd.com , Etsy eBay, Shopify and others including Amazon. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/fxzG9m5)

The market was led again by small caps as well as value and high dividend plays while growth and momentum companies were down again. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9HcqktG)

Here is the heat map for the S&amp;P500  [MAP](https://ibb.co/DG8f1JW) where you can see most of the big tech companies as well of most of the credit services were down. While the broader market map shows the transition to energy plays as well as industrials [MAP](https://ibb.co/vz48M8g). Whereas tech companies like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft extended losses from Monday this dragged the Nasdaq Index down.

The volatility index maintained steady at the 25 level slightly lower than yesterday but keeping that support line that will be maintained for a period in my opinion [VIX](https://ibb.co/3MmwnjF) with the VIX withstanding the huge market volume from Monday, as early data from Reuters shows that there were nearly 2 trillion $ being exchanged [NEWS](https://ibb.co/xMNCPNz) as value stocks had the best one-day performance against growth stocks ever in the US as brokers worldwide had problems handling this huge volume of trading with companies like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Charles Schwab experiencing issues. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Xx1dwpG)

So, democrats have clinched House control but they really disappointed expectations as they were expecting to gain even more seats as much as 15 but this has moved to a loss of seats that stand at 6 and counting at the moment. This has completed 2 thirds of the best results the stock market was expecting with only the Senate being up for grabs at the beginning of January. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qCkzY3x)

Today there are not many events in the economic calendar as only Mortgage Applications number are expected, as the bond markets are also closed for Veterans day, stocks will see most of the trading today.

Yesterday Apple launched the first MacBook laptops with the in-house built processor, this will move closer the Mac and iPhone as they will both have the Apple processors from now, cutting they tie the company had with Intel that bad provided them for almost 15 years. The new Macs seem to have huge improvements in performance and battery life. This will likely be a boost to the addressable market of the Macs as they will address the people who need big performance in they’re computers as well as people who are looking for good cheap computer as the new Mac Mini desktop is 100$ cheaper than the previous version. This will be a more than 15 billion addressable market for Apple as they continue to improve products and services all the time. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/RHsDQx6)

Boeing announced that they have lost another 12 orders for the 737 MAX and delivered just 13 aircrafts, the delivery number is down from 20 aircrafts in the same month from a year ago. So they have only delivered 111 aircrafts this year a huge decrease from 321 just a year ago in the same period. [BOEING NEWS](https://ibb.co/HTZSB94)

The stock has seen a surge of more than 30% as people are rushing back to own the stocks after positive news on the ending of the 737 max grounding as well as the vaccine news.

This was also helped by the fact that the just secured worth almost 10 billion $ with the Air Force. [BOEING CONTRACT](https://ibb.co/6vRFGjF)

Alibaba just announced that orders made on its e-commerce platform during the Singles Day event have exceeded 56 billion $ by today as consumers are still splashing out money on buying products online. Singles day is the world’s biggest sales event eclipsing both Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the US combined as it stretches over 4 main days this year. They have received more than 16 times the orders that Amazon received last month in its two-day Prime event. This are finally some good news for the company as it has lost almost 76 billion $ of it’s market value after the suspension of Ant Group IPO which they own about a third of. I believe this will be a great opportunity to buy the stocks as it is way down from its highs. Ant Group will eventually file and have they’re IPO in the next year which will boost the stock up once again even if it will be at a much lower valuation for the company. [ALIBABA NEWS](https://ibb.co/JFBvPV7)

Some other news interesting news is that Airbnb has delayed the documents release for the IPO, as they decided to delay these more from the US elections. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0JKW0wD)

Also, Uber is expected to close a deal worth more than 2,5 billion $ after the DOJ has cleared the way [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Tkbx1FN) 

While Ford is moving more and more to address the EV market as they are expected to release a lot of EV models starting next year.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qxNmdyT)

While the jobs openings from September has seen a revision that moves it closer to the 6,5 million that where expected as the job openings rate was more than double the quits rate. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zFrrpsZ)

This as the small business optimism was flat last month a lower value than was expected but the same as September [NEWS](https://ibb.co/RjgKNLw) pretty much in line with TD’s Investor movement that was flat also in the last month. [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/X2fv359)

So, I believe great times are ahead as do many of the investors as a post-election poll shows that over 60% expect a positive return next year. But be aware any derailments or delays of the vaccines may bring more volatility to the stock market. [POLL](https://ibb.co/SxqtQSL)

8 out of 9 analysts rate SPCE a buy. It was an unheard of 8 out of 8 until Goldman Sachs decided to rate it neutral, in late October and ruin the party. Odd timing right?

SPCE is the second most shorted stock on the Street (after GME) and shorts are currently paying 9% interest to maintain their positions.

This is building up to what will invariably be a short squeeze of biblical proportions as SPCE will be making history in literally 10 days! This 3rd successful powered flight will likely seal the deal for their FAA COMMERCIAL SPACE LICENSE! This will also be the first human space flight in the history of New Mexico!

The 52 week high was 42 dollars! Market cap is still under 5 billion!

Stocks traded choppily today, with market participants taking a breather after an initial wave of optimism over a potential coronavirus vaccine. Shares of tech companies remain under pressure, with the Nasdaq underperforming the other two major indices.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.79% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.14% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) outperformed, finishing 0.93% up.

Yesterday, Pfizer’s (PFE) and BioNTech’s (BNTX) announced that the vaccine candidate was 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 in patients participating in the clinical trial. The news fueled a market rally yesterday, with the SPY and DIA reaching intraday records. However, since the record-highs, both indices have pared gains. Stuart Kaiser, UBS Head of Equity Deritavtives Research, said, “I think the big surprise was the efficacy. I think you had polled investors before this, the efficacy range would have been 50-75% as sort of a wide range. And if this number is truly 90% or above, I think that is what the market is responding so positively to.”

In other positive from the medical sector, Eli Lilly (LLY) announced it received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its antibody therapy used to treat moderate to severe cases of COVID-19. This comes a few weeks after regeneron, a drug produced by Gildead (GILD) that also treats moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 was approved by the FDA. 

A successful vaccine is seen by market participants as a necessary component for safe, sustained, and broad economic reopening. According to Yahoo Finance, an estimate 27 million workers, around 22% of the workforce, work in close physical proximity with others. In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a vaccine is a key component.

Still, despite the good news, it is important to note that widespread distribution of the vaccine may took months, after approval is granted. To produce enough doses and distribute them globally will be a massive, logistical undertaking, one that will take some time to put in place. Some analysts have cautioned to extrapolating positive vaccine data to thinking distribution is just around the corner. Carter Henderson, portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital, said ““The vaccine news is really a 2021 story and we still have the worst to deal with COVID, as cases run at new highs. So the vaccine is not an immediate fix. That’s why we believe stimulus is still on the table. So if we get news about stimulus early in next year coupled with vaccine news, we think the market could have a true melt-up.”

**Highlights**

* Tech stocks, which have broadly outperformed the market since March, did not participate in yesterday’s rally, with the pullback accelerating during today’s session. 
* Shares of cruise lines, airlines and hotel companies, and other reopening stocks that would greatly benefit from a vaccine, gave back some gains after surging higher yesterday.
* Apple (AAPL) just announced its first homemade chip for the Mac, the M1. The company also introduced three new Macs powered by the chip.
* Beyond Meat (BYND) is reportedly working with Pizza Hut (YUM) to developed plant-based Italian sausages. The stock is around 20% down  today after McDonald’s announced its own brand of plant-based meat alternatives.

Yesterday there was a lot of movement in the stock market as companies that benefited a lot from the stay and work from home environment saw a huge drop with gaming companies like EA or Take Two interactive tumbling as well as Peloton and Zoom who fell more than 15% while even the biggest companies like Amazon felt the shift being down more than 5% [NEWS](https://ibb.co/72kPtK3) [NEWS](https://ibb.co/GQY3p1t)

Meanwhile any stock that included in person participation like airline and travel stocks saw a huge spike in price, as they finally have some end point of the pandemic in sight with some big gains from companies like AMC, Cinemark, Carnival  [MOVEMENTS](https://ibb.co/HzfLkQM)

While Starbucks also made a new all time high as the company will benefit a lot from the reopening as well as improved Us-China relationship. [STARBUCKS](https://ibb.co/j9CW5Z4)

Other companies that saw a big drop yesterday were Bed Bath &amp;Beyond, Chewy, Domino’s &amp; Papa John’s and many more. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/51Rfx9N)

With huge gains being made in the financial sectors with most banks soaring while credit card companies also joined the rally [NEWS](https://ibb.co/nkCD15q) [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0Z2hzv6)

The announcement made yesterday will also impact the eventual stimulus bill size, as it is likely the bill will be smaller with a more limited time horizon, but this stimulus is still needed as a bridge between now and the time the benefits of the vaccine as lots of businesses still are under a lot of pressure.  [STIMULUS UPDATE](https://ibb.co/mRsgpK1)

We will also have to wait and see other companies finishing vaccines as the Pfizer one is very hard to deliver from a logistics standpoint it needs to be kept at very low temperatures well below freezing. [LOGISTICS PROBLEM](https://ibb.co/fvVFKyc)

Fortunately treatments of the illness are also progressing with Eli Lilly getting emergency use authorization for a new treatment [Eli Lilly NEWS](https://ibb.co/9HwPPsH)

So yesterday there was a lot of movement in the stocks as more than 70% were advancing with a 96% of new highs vs lows and the volume was up but in this case it was massive with more than 70% percent of companies having above average volume, this lead to a lot of brokers having issues handling the stocks.

The Dow was the biggest gainer up almost 3% with intraday gains of more than 5% at one point [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/TTb7kdR) , The Nasdaq had a wild ride being up and down but eventually finishing the day down more than 1,5%[NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/N2KNBCV)  and the S&amp;P making new highs but eventually dropping back finishing the day just over 1% up [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/HdfLtq2)

The biggest gainers came from the energy and financial sectors yesterday with tech and comms suffering the most while small cap and value plays outperformed the market [SIZE CHART](https://ibb.co/zQ1r1bf) with the volatility index not moving to much as I expect this to remain at this level for the next months until we get some more updates on vaccines, stimulus debates and finally with the next president taking over.

Here is the heat map for yesterday as you can see the market was pretty split with the tech and stay at home names being punished while the recovery plays were up big.  [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/MDMbDFp)

Today Microsoft will launch the new xBox series X and S just before the biggest competitor for the xBox is due to unveil the new PlayStation5, this is a growing part of Microsoft business and i really like they’re products for gaming despite the PS being more popular.

Apple is expected to announce the new Macs, this is expected to present a more than 15 billion dollars opportunity for Apple [NEWS](https://ibb.co/kgK5bMK). Also the company will start taking orders at the end of this week in more than 50 countries [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hYTsn4p), I believe this is a great opportunity to buy the stock at a lower price with this drop in tech companies. They are my favorite company to own as they are expanding the company vertically and are releasing great new subscriptions based services while also benefiting from the cycle of moving phones to 5G.

The watchdogs seem to be going after big tech as Amazon has been hit with a couple of bad news in the last couple of days, as the vaccine coming out will likely slow the growth of the company beyond 2021, another news came today as the European Union will announce antitrust charges against them, i don’t see this as a big problem for the company as the charges are not very solid.[AMAZON NEWS](https://ibb.co/M25SZ6q)  So I still believe in the company and i will wait for the markets to calm down after the recent drop in stay at home plays to add to my position to the company. Likewise google is being investigated in India for potentially squeezing out competitor in payment processing with Google Pay. [GOOGLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/Jv6h4Lh)

Today Disney also announced that they will cut even more into the employed staff, but they will strongly come back late next year, they are one of my favorite companies as i really like the expansion to the streaming business with Disney+ and Hulu. [DISNEY NEWS](https://ibb.co/vd90pJ4)

So Beyond Meat has been up and down in the last 36hours as the company was down big after McDonalds announced a new plant based product that didn’t include the company [NEWS](https://ibb.co/gJsvQyd) , afterwards the company jumped back up to positive [NEWS](https://ibb.co/DVj49S6) before eventually finishing the day down huge after they announced a huge miss on estimates, as the gross profit margin fell 6% since a year ago [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/gzPbxMY), while the EBITDA result was a loss of over 4 million dollars versus a more than 13 million profit expected [BYND EPS](https://ibb.co/tPn21Fp).

So be aware and stay sharp when trading, despite infections rising in more than 60 countries with the US leading the pack in both cases and death and with new records and the highest moving average since march, I believe this will be a great time to own stocks as the political landscape is the most favorable one, [GLOBAL STATS](https://ibb.co/NTYDShp) [US DAILY STATS](https://ibb.co/0tHtRDf)

### Market Notes:

Pfizer announced it's vaccine candidate was 90% effective against COVID-19. While the results don't include any long-term results this early stage is promising.

One thing interesting about the vaccine, it must be kept cold during shipping. I'm keeping a special lookout for refrigeration stocks like HUSN.

Travel stocks are in play. I have several on my list this morning.

Markets soared to all-time highs yesterday at the open but gave back much of the gains by the end of the day. I'm bullish overall but we could see another day or two of selling to let allow the news cycle to settle out. Futures are down at writing.

I've recently gotten 2 spammers who advertised their ""forex"" proposals to me within 3-4 days of each other. They both have something in common. When I checked their profile, they both have these great images of their wealth such as pictures of their pool, their cars, and some sort of laptop with candle graphs. They also posted frequently on r/freekarma4u, which I thought constituted a violation due it being vote manipulations. I tried reverse looking up their images and they seem to be unique but some are from Facebook/Instagram posts.

Stocks roared to record highs this morning before tapering off throughout the day. Market participants digested the election of Joe Biden and the release of promising data for a coronavirus vaccine.

On Saturday, the historical presidential election finally came to a conclusion. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee and former Vice President, was declared the victor after mounting a remarkable comeback in Pennsylvania, a state Trump won in 2016. The Associated Press called the race Saturday morning. Biden promised to work toward uniting a deeply divided nation, calling for an end of “this grim era of demonization in America” and saying “I see no blue states or red states. Only the United States.”

President Trump, on the other hand, is refusing to concede the election and is mounting a legal challenge, claiming widespread voter fraud. After news broke of Biden’s victory, he tweeted “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!” In a statement yesterday, Pres. Trump said, “The simple fact is this election is far from over. Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. Several of Trump’s fellow Republican colleagues have publicly expressed disapproval of the President’s actions. We’ll provide updates as this situation develops.

After Biden’s win, a split government, in which different parties control the Senate and the White House is looking likely.  According to a number of analysts, traders like a divided government, where no single party would control each of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Under that scenario, major policy changes are unlikely to get advanced. Stephanie Miller, managing director of Fiscal Note Markets, said, “What Wall Street wants more than everything is for nothing to happen in Washington. There is so much of a bias for a static policy environment – that you can actually make business decisions and have those decisions hold the test of time beyond a couple of years. And so more gridlock in Washington tends to be better.” 

This morning Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech announced that their clinical trial showed that a 90% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in participants with no evidence of a previous infection. “Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19. With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis.,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO.
