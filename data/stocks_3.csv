Valued at 6.1x AFFO Hersha Hospitality Trust ($HT) already looks cheap with a discount to NAV of 37% and a yield of 8.6% based on an AFFO payout rate of just 56%. 

Those metrics should improve further as numerous upgrades have disrupted operations but should start adding to cash flow growth in the near term.  Specifically, two of the REIT’s most profitable hotels in south Florida are operational again (after Hurricane Irma in 2017) and are expected to boost EBITDA by 20-25%.

Hotel REITs are out of favor at the moment but $HT’s already cheap valuation offers downside protection while 20%+ AFFO growth provides tangible upside supported by insider buying.

A few analysts picked up on Pfizer’s new strategy for the spinoff—but they’re not sure the outlook for the redesigned Upjohn is so rosy.

Pfizer said it now plans to sell two assets to the Mylan-Upjohn spinoff, which will be named Viatris. They are Meridian, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injectable products, and Mylan-Japan, which is the generics collaboration Pfizer formed with Mylan in 2012. Revenues from both units totaled $598 million last year and were flat from the previous year, Pfizer said (PDF).

As a result, Pfizer upped its 2020 revenue guidance for Upjohn to $8 billion to $8.5 billion, from $7.5 billion to $8 billion. But the company isn't expecting much of a bottom-line boost for the bulked-up unit: It nudged up the high end of its forecast for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, but kept the low end at $3.8 billion. The company is expecting to close the Viatris spinoff in mid-2020.


But even the low end of 2020 expectations for Upjohn could be hard to achieve, some analysts fear. It’s “a high bar,” warned SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia in a note to clients after Pfizer’s earnings announcement Tuesday.

Why? One problem is that during the fourth quarter three major Upjohn products missed SVB Leerink’s expectations: Lyrica in the U.S., and Norvasc and Lipitor in emerging markets. That “reinforces our thesis that there could be more downside to these products in 2020 and beyond,” Fadia wrote.

Lyrica, in particular, is struggling against generic competitors. It’s been a challenge ever since the product lost its patent protection last summer and its share of U.S. prescriptions plummeted to 43% within weeks as a wave of generic rivals hit the market.

During the fourth quarter, U.S. sales of Lyrica came in at $88 million, a whopping 91% fall over the same period a year ago and 34% below SVB Leerink’s expectations.


Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat also has low expectations for Upjohn in the short term, but much of his concern centers on China. The country has been rolling out a volume-based procurement (VBP) program designed to save money on off-patent drugs. Revenues from Lipitor and Norvasc took a hit in the provinces where the program was pilot-tested, and Pfizer executives told Raffat they expect a broad rollout to all Chinese provinces in 2020.

The sales declines on Lipitor and Norvasc in China seemed to be slowing down in the last half of 2020, Raffat noted. But with VBP set to expand, “that implies more [sales] erosion yet to come in 2020,” he warned in a note to investors.

Assuming Pfizer consummates the plan to fold Meridian and Mylan-Japan into Viatris, that in and of itself will place another challenge on the spinoff’s shoulders. Meridian has been suffering from manufacturing issues, resulting in an EpiPen supply shortfall that has opened the door for competitors. Novartis’ Sandoz unit, for one, took advantage of the situation last July, launching an aggressive rollout of its EpiPen rival Symjepi.

“It remains unclear whether the supply issue of EpiPen could get remedied once [Viatris] has the full control of Meridian,” Fadia said.

**Guyana Goldstrike Inc.** (TSXV: **GYA**, OTC: **GYNAF**, FSE: **1ZT**) announced it has signed a definitive gold forward purchase agreement, dated January 24, 2020, with an arms-length investor for proceeds of up to US$9,000,000, for the Marudi Gold Project located in Guyana, South America.

Under the terms of the agreement, the investor will make an initial payment of $2-million (U.S.) on or before April 14, 2020. Thereafter, a second payment of $7-million (U.S.) will be advanced within 30 days of a royalty interest in the project in favour of the investor having been registered.

The agreement is non-dilutive to the company's current share structure as no shares or warrants will be issued to the investor. The proceeds will enable the company to finalize its purchase of the project and further explore and develop the resource potential of the property.

In consideration for providing financing, the company has agreed to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold, representing approximately 10 per cent of the project's current mineral resource estimate (please see mineral resource estimates section herein). Deliveries will commence within 120 days of a declaration of commercial production from the project, or within 36 months of the initial financing under the agreement, whichever is the earlier, with an annual delivery schedule of 3,000 ounces. The company has also agreed to grant the investor a right of first refusal to acquire a further 30,000 ounces of gold, on terms to be negotiated between the parties.

The delivery obligation of the company will be secured by a 12.5-per-cent net smelter return royalty in favour of the investor, to be registered against the project. The royalty will not be payable while the company meets the delivery schedule and will expire once all delivery obligations under the agreement have been satisfied.

Mineral resource estimates

The Mazoa Hill zone contains the company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggest that the mineralized zone is open in several directions, including at depth:

* 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 grams per tonne;
* 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 grams per tonne.

For further information concerning the Mazoa Hill zone resource estimate, readers are encouraged to review ""Technical Report: Marudi Property, Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate,"" a technical report prepared for the company by Global Mineral Resource Services and available at the company's website and under the company's profile on SEDAR.

Readers are cautioned that although the project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining licence, a production decision has not been reached by the company in respect of the project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the project. Also note that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

About Guyana Goldstrike Inc.

The company is developing the Marudi gold project, which has a 17-year mining licence and is located in Guyana, South America. Historical diamond drilling completed on the project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: the Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones.

Through the recent exploration program, the company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1,000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the company has over 45 square kilometres of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the project.

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open despite ongoing coronavirus concerns, following Wall Street’s strong Tuesday rebound. Investors are focused on corporate earnings and this afternoon’s Fed decision as well, following the S&amp;P 500′s strongest one-day gain since October and the Nasdaq’s best daily gain since September. All the major averages are currently sitting roughly 2% below their all-time intraday highs. (CNBC)
* Set to help the Dow this morning, Apple (AAPL) shares were up 2% in premarket trading after the company reported blockbuster iPhone revenue of $56 billion for its fiscal first quarter, blowing past estimates, proving that the new iPhone 11 was off to a strong start over the holidays. Overall Q1 profit and revenue were better than expectations. The fastest-growing segment was Wearables, Home and Accessories. (CNBC)
* CEO Tim Cook says Apple shut one store in China and it’s restricting employee travel due to coronavirus (CNBC)
* Dow components Boeing (BA), Dow Incorporated (DOW) and McDonald’s (MCD) lead this morning’s list of earnings.

(CNBC)
* GE shares rise 5% after earnings top expectations (CNBC)
* The Federal Reserve concludes its latest policy meeting today with interest rates almost certainly to remain on hold but officials likely to discuss possible changes to how they manage the central bank’s key overnight borrowing rate. Fed policymakers issue their decision at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference. This morning, the National Association of Realtors issues its December pending home sales report at 10 a.m. ET. (CNBC)

* British Airways cancels all flights to and from mainland China on coronavirus fears (CNBC)
* The Senate has 16 hours, beginning today, to present written questions in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial.

* GOP lacks votes to block impeachment trial witnesses (WSJ)
* Trump’s long-awaited Middle East peace plan calls for a state of Palestine with a capital in east Jerusalem. The plan calls for the recognition of Israeli settlements in the West Bank in exchange for a four-year freeze on new settlement activity. The proposal favors Israel and was immediately rejected by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. (CNBC)
* The helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant didn’t have a recommended warning system to alert the pilot he was too close to land but it’s not clear it would have averted the crash that killed nine because the pilot may have lost control as the aircraft plunged into a fog-shrouded mountain, federal investigators said. Determining what caused the crash will take months. (AP)
* TNT’s NBA crew, including Shaquille O’Neal, Dwyane Wade, honor Kobe Bryant (USA Today)
* A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no reports of casualties or heavy damage.

To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $763 million (after the recent increase).

The $7 bid follows two bids in December between $3-$5 which Sorrento immediately declined saying “the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders."" The $7 bid, binding or not, suggests other parties may very well agree. Either way, management clearly think the company’s value is well in excess of yesterdays close at $4.05 and, with all their insider knowledge, they probably know more than most.

Hepion's drug candidate, CRV431, prevented experimentally induced liver fibrosis to a greater extent than four other leading NASH drug candidates. The results support the potential for CRV431 to exert potent antifibrotic activity in NASH.

""CRV431 offers a novel approach to the treatment of fibrosis caused by NASH and possibly other causes of liver injury,"" stated Dr. Robert Foster, CEO of Hepion Pharmaceuticals. ""This is because CRV431 acts, in part, by directly targeting fibrotic scar formation by down-regulating an important regulator of collagen synthesis, cyclophilin B, thereby reducing collagen production. This contrasts with most other NASH drug candidates that target events such as dyslipidemia or diabetes that may lead to fibrosis. Combining the direct antifibrotic actions of CRV431 with the indirect actions of other drug candidates likely represents the best opportunity for rapidly and effectively decreasing liver fibrosis in NASH.""

Jan 27, 2020 (TheNewswire.ca via COMTEX) -- (via TheNewswire)

Vancouver, Canada - TheNewswire - January 27, 2020 - Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Guyana Goldstrike"") (GYA) [**GYNAF,** **+37.43%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gynaf?mod=MW_story_quote) (1ZT) is pleased to announce the Company has signed a definitive gold forward purchase agreement (the ""Agreement""), dated January 24, 2020, with an arms-length investor (the ""Investor"") for proceeds of up to US$9,000,000, for the Marudi Gold Project (""Marudi"" or the ""Property"", or the ""Project"") located in Guyana, South America.

Under the terms of the Agreement, the Investor will make an initial payment of US$2,000,000 on or before April 14, 2020. Thereafter, a second payment of US$7,000,000 will be advanced within thirty days of a royalty interest in the Project in favour of the Investor having been registered.

The Agreement is non-dilutive to the Company's current share structure as no shares or warrants will be issued to the Investor. The proceeds will enable the Company to finalize its purchase of the Project and further explore and develop the resource potential of the Property.

In consideration for providing funding, the Company has agreed to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold, representing approximately 10% of the Project's current mineral resource estimate (please see ""Mineral Resource Estimates"" below). Deliveries will commence within 120 days of a declaration of commercial production from the Project, or within 36 months of the initial funding under the Agreement, whichever the earlier, with an annual delivery schedule of 3,000 ounces. The Company has also agreed to grant the Investor a right of first refusal to acquire a further 30,000 ounces of gold, on terms to be negotiated between the parties.

The delivery obligation of the Company will be secured by a 12.5% net smelter returns royalty in favour of the Investor, to be registered against the Project. The royalty will not be payable while the Company meets the deliver schedule and will expire once all delivery obligations under the Agreement have been satisfied.

Mineral Resource Estimates

The Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open in several directions including at depth.

\- 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 g/t;

\- 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 g/t

For further information concerning the Mazoa Hill Zone Resource Estimate, readers are encouraged to review ""Technical Report: Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate"", a technical report prepared for the Company by Global Mineral Resource Services and is available at: GYA Mazoa Hill Zone 43-101, at the Company's website [**www.guyanagoldstrike.com**](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/) and under the Company's profile on [**www.sedar.com**](http://www.sedar.com/).

Readers are cautioned that although the Project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining license a production decision has not been reached by the Company in respect of the Project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the Project. Also note, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

About Guyana Goldstrike Inc.

The Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project, which has a 17-year mining license and is located in Guyana, South America. Historic diamond drilling completed on the Project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. A mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Mazoa Hill Zone. Data analyzed suggests the zone is open to mineralization in multiple directions and at depth.

Through the recent exploration program, the Company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the Company has over 45 sq. kms of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the Project.

About Guyana

The Republic of Guyana is located in South America adjacent to Suriname. The country is English speaking and its legal system is based on British common law with a democratically elected government. It has an established mining act and a rich history of gold production. The Fraser Institute's 2016 Annual Survey of Mining listed Guyana as the third best mining jurisdiction with regards to investment attractiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean Basin sub-group. The Guiana Shield is the geographic gold-hosting region and is world-recognized as a premier gold region that is highly prospective, under-explored and has geological continuity with West Africa. Barrick has recently announced that the Giuana Shield will be their priority region for discovery opportunities and early stage exploration.\* Exxon Recently announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels of offshore oil with production scheduled for first quarter of 2020. This discovery will designate Guyana as having the fastest growing GPD in 2020, estimated to be 86%.\*\*

* if the US and other countries decide to suspend the trade with china, ( e.g. the agricultural products), it will impacts on global economy. AFAIK, US and western will love to find excuse to stop/lower/suspend trade with China. To contain the plague is a good excuse to do so.
* the China government forces a ""stay at home"" policy. 3 extra day-off equal 1% down in GDP (3/ 365 \~ 1%). this saying is inaccurate but you got the point. Even 0.1% drop in GDP will cause big trouble.

So far I have not had a day of loss since I started trading again, which hasn't been too long.  I don't really want to trade with money that I cannot afford to lose, so even trading with a margin loan just makes it so that I'm borrowing money where my collateral is *my* money.  So if the value of a stock goes against me by 50%, I lose 100% of my investment and my shares get closed out (long/short).  Not to mention margin calls and margin maintenance.  However, if I take out a personal loan with a monthly repayment of around $100-$150, then I am trading with more than I can currently trade with, and I'm not risking losing money that I cannot afford to lose.  And I wouldn't have to worry about losing twice the money in half the movement.  So then this loan would be exclusively for trading with.  Worst case scenario I'm paying $100/month and have learned a valuable lesson which is fine with my current financial situation.  I'm only going to be going long and short on companies that fit my trading strategies.

For all intents and purposes taking out a personal loan feels wiser in my current situation than taking out a margin loan, as I otherwise would not have what feels like a safer way of coming up with a significant enough amount of money to have consistent small percentage gains generate passable supplemental income; though I would likely put the profits back into the investment account and pay the monthly repayment cost out of pocket.

The people in my life that I have shared this with see where I am coming from, though initially being against it, are now starting to agree with me, given certain life circumstances that restrict me from generating much investment capital otherwise.

In any posts however people have been against it for the most part, so I wanted to explain my reasoning and see what anyone here thought of it.

When reading the ""risks"" outlined by Vanguard ([VOO's Terms](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/voo)), they state...

&gt;Although S&amp;P 500 ETF is listed for trading on the NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained. Trading of S&amp;P 500 ETF on the NYSE Arca may be halted if NYSE Arca officials deem such action appropriate, if S&amp;P 500 ETF is delisted from the NYSE Arca, or if the activation of marketwide “circuit breakers” halts stock trading generally.

Is there a possibility that trading could be frozen (no buying or selling) on VOO and other ETF's in a massive sell-off?

Based on what Mark Fitzgerald, head of equity product management at Vanguard said ([article](https://www.ft.com/content/464d8d78-a843-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde))...

&gt;If anything were to happen to us, the owner of one of our products has a direct legal ownership right on those underlying shares which are held at the custodian.

I'm hoping February will be more of a plateau than a dip, but theres a lot of questions we have to ask. How will Chinese stocks hold up with the corona virus? Could this potentially impact phase 2 of the US china trade deal as well?

I suppose the big elephant in the room, (I don't want this to turn into a political thread please) is what are the two scenarios for the U.S. market if A. Trump is impeached or B. He is not impeached? I'd imagine not much would change if he wasn't, but I could foresee a slight to moderate drop if he was. We still seem to be amid tensions in the middle east after the latest attack on a U.S. Embassy in Iraq, doesn't seem like we will be leaving the middle east anytime soon. 

Additionally with all of the environmental issues and Tesla possibly looking like the future of cars, does anyone still feel safe holding onto oil companies for short term or even long? Defensive stocks seem to be the safest thing right now for short and long term, especially since historically we usually spend most of our budget here in America on the military. 

That being said, is Boeing a bargain buy right now or will we continue to see prices dip even further this month?

If there is anything else major I missed on what might effect the stock market in February, please discuss!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Not sure if this is the place for this discussion but I'm a student newly studying economics.

I learned that the United States central bank, made up of a committee, sets the interest or borrowing rate. Generally, when interest rates goes up, stocks go down as higher interest rates for several reasons. 

I think is seen as a drag on the economy. Companies are less likely to invest/borrow when interest is high. Some stock holders might put some of their funds into cash if interest is high enough as the safer investment. 

With that said, are members of the FED committee allowed to own stocks? If they do own stocks, wouldn't they have a personal interest in inflating the stock price because they would gain? Indirectly, is this also like insider trading since they know exactly how much and when they will raise/lower interest rates?

FDX   and United Parcel Service Inc. UPS  in the U.S.; and its growing advertising business, which will snap the stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on that category.

On Monday, SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia published her answer, and it wasn’t rosy.

Fadia downgraded Mylan (ticker: MYL) to Market Perform from Outperform, writing that she sees earnings for the combined companies dropping for the next two years.

“We do not see the combined business starting to grow until 2023, which we believe is not fully understood,” Fadia wrote. “This is because we see the business deteriorating faster than realization of cost synergies and we do not see revenue synergies anytime soon.”

Fadia set a price target of $24, down from her previous price target of $27. The stock closed on Friday at $21.85.

Shares of Mylan were tumbling Monday morning, down 3.3% to $21.13 in early trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4%. Mylan didn’t immediately respond to request for comment on the downgrade.

The back story. Mylan is set to merge with Pfizer’s (PFE) generic-drug unit, called Upjohn, later this year to become a new generic-drug company called Viatris. The merger marks a major turning point for Pfizer, but also for Mylan. In early January, Piper Sandler analyst David Amsellempublished a cautionary note on the merger, giving Mylan a Neutral rating. Mylan was up 8.7% this year as of Friday’s close, but down 24.8% over the past 12 months.

What’s new. In her Monday note, Fadia warned that the Upjohn part of the business faces serious challenges, attributable in large part to changes in how the Chinese government buys drugs.

“We believe the potential impact from China’s [volume based procurement] program for Lipitor and Norvasc is underestimated by both Pfizer and the Street, with potentially a $1.3 [billion] revenue headwind in 2020, or $200-600 [million] more than Pfizer’s guidance,” Fadia wrote.

She also wrote that Mylan’s own earnings would see only slow growth in the coming years. “We see the Mylan standalone business growing low single digits at best through 2023 with all key major products declining and no clear sustainable growth drivers in the pipeline,” Fadia wrote.

Still, she said that there is hope for the stock. “We acknowledge that this merger could become accretive to Mylan’s shareholders if Viatris can pull off revenue synergies faster and/or realize more cost synergies, but the potential scope and timeline of such synergies so far remains unclear,” she wrote.

Looking forward. Fadia argued that the current price of Mylan factors into the merger. “We forecast revenue decline of 13% in 2020 and 3% in 2021 for Viatris, followed by a relatively flat top-line in 2022-2023.”

Pfizer reports earnings Tuesday morning and investors could learn more about the merger on a conference call scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Eastern time.

* With the coronavirus spreading, world stocks are tumbling and perceived safer investments are rising. U.S. stock futures are sliding early Monday following Wall Street’s worst day of 2020 on Friday. The Dow already has a four-day losing streak in place, its longest since August, and is coming off its largest weekly loss in five months. The S&amp;P 500′s weekly decline last week was its largest in nearly four months. (CNBC)
* Treasury yields move lower as coronavirus fears escalate (CNBC)
* Gold climbs to 2-week high as virus fears spark safety buying (Reuters)
* International oil prices drop below $60 as China virus drives demand concern (Reuters)
* More than 2,800 people in China are now infected by the fast-spreading Wuhan coronavirus while more countries have reported their first confirmed cases. Chinese officials have said there are 2,862 confirmed cases, with the death toll rising to 81. On Sunday, the United States on Sunday reported its fifth confirmed case in Arizona. (CNBC)
* Travel-related stocks are likely to be hit once again as coronavirus cases mount, including major airlines like United (UAL), Delta (DAL), American (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), and cruise line operators like Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald’s have temporarily closed near the Chinese city of Wuhan.
* On today’s U.S. economic calendar, the government will release its December report on new home sales at 10 a.m. ET. Arconic (ARNC), DR Horton (DH) and Sprint (S) are among the companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while Whirlpool (WHR), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Rambus (RMBS) report after the bell.
* Federal safety investigators launched a probe into a helicopter crash in the LA area that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight others, including his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined. NBA athletes, officials and fans mourned Bryant’s death in messages and memorials across social media. (CNBC)
* ‘Terrible,’ ‘heartbreaking,’ ‘devastated’ — World leaders and athletes mourn the death of Kobe Bryant (CNBC)
* Athletes pay tribute to Kobe Bryant. ‘He was like a little brother to me’ Michael Jordan says (CNBC)
* A passenger plane crashed in central Afghanistan, senior Afghan officials said today. According to local media, the plane went down in territory under Taliban control. It was initially reported to be a jet from state-owned Ariana Afghan Airlines. However, the airline’s acting CEO has denied that one of their planes has crashed. (CNBC)
* President Donald Trump is expected to disclose details of his long-delayed Mideast peace proposal to Israeli leaders today. Trump will hold separate, back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White Party. Gantz is Netanyahu’s rival in March 2 elections. (Reuters)
* Trump’s impeachment trial enters a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. (AP)
* Democrats stepped up their calls for former national security advisor John Bolton to testify at the trial after an explosive report alleged that in his unpublished book, he said Trump personally tied Ukraine aid to an investigation of the Bidens, an account that conflicts with the president’s. (NBC News)
* Trump denies telling Bolton Ukraine aid was tied to investigations (The Hill)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders holds an edge in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary as the key presidential nominating contest nears, according to an NBC News/Marist poll. The Vermont senator garners the support of 22% of likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State, the survey found. Ex-Mayor Pete Buttigieg trails at 17%. (CNBC)
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren seeks spark in final Iowa push after getting Des Moines Register endorsement (AP)
* U.S. state attorneys general will meet Justice Department attorneys next week to share information on their investigations into Google (GOOGL), Reuters reported. * The probes revolve around monopolistic behavior that may harm consumers through Google’s control of online advertising markets and search traffic.

The stock is up so freaking much in one quarter, I assume that institutional investors were riding all of our FOMO investing (and egging it on with issuing new price targets)that they plan to dump Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning before ER. So I am switching to a short term short as it's easy to foresee a brutal sell-off pre-earnings this week amidst FUD, where this thing gets down into the 510 range with a ::finger snap:: gap down and then breaking below 500 on technicals and behavioral finance reflexivity (fear) .

##### Assure Holdings Corp. (“Assure”) was founded in Colorado in 2015 to provide intraoperative neuromonitoring (“IONM”) services for spine, ear, nose, throat, cardiovascular, and other surgeries involving a patient’s central nervous system. IONM has been developed and used over the past 20 years and has become a standard of care in the healthcare industry. 

IONM reduces the risk of central nervous system damage after certain types of surgeries. Injuries stemming from surgeries involving a patient’s central nervous system can be difficult to detect immediately following surgery, so IONM allows physicians to detect injuries before they become so severe that no viable action can be taken. Common risks of surgeries involving the central nervous system include paralysis, muscle weakness, and hearing loss.

# Management Team

In 2018, Assure’s founder and CEO, Preston Parsons, transitioned to a director on the company’s board, focused on key growth initiatives such as surgical/geographical expansion and strategic acquisitions. Simultaneously, John Farlinger became the company’s CEO. Mr. Farlinger has \~20 years of experience as a venture capital and private equity executive. It’s worth mentioning that both Mr. Parsons and Mr. Farlinger received total compensation around $350,000 in 2018 with Mr. Parsons owning \~39% of the company (equivalent to a $16 million stake at today’s stock price of $1.22). As a result, I believe the company’s management team is well incentivized to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. 

# Financials

Year-to-date 2019, the company grew revenue 112% to $22.4 million, as well as increasing net income and adjusted EBITDA to $9.3 million and $13.8 million, representing increases of 143% and 154%, respectively. In addition, Assure grew its managed case volume by 95% in Q3 2019. In the first half of 2019, the company completed a $0.7 million tuck-in acquisitions that added a couple hundred cases to Assure’s market share. The company recently announced a $7.0 million acquisition for a company that is slated to close in early 2020. This acquisition has completed 2,500 cases in the last 12 months, 95% of which were derived from commercial insurance payors (compared to \~50% for Assure). I would expect Assure to continue to pursue more acquisitions as the company continues to scale and is able to gain access to more growth capital to further consolidate the IONM industry. 

# Key Risks

It’s worth noting that this company is fairly small, with a market cap of approximately $50 million. This means the company historically had a fairly concentrated portion of revenue generated from a single state/surgical procedure, in addition to various other operational/execution risks. For instance, the company suffered from some revenue cycle management and cash collection issues in 2018, which resulted in a large bad debt expense for the year. The company recently hired a VP of strategy and a revenue cycle management director in order to better control cash collections and avoid a similar bad debt expense charge the company recorded in 2018. Out-of-network revenue and cash collections remain key issues to monitor going forward.

# Summary

Given the company’s progress in 2019, I estimate that Assure will generate revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million, $12 million, and $18 million, respectively. This equates to net and EBITDA margins of 40% and 60%, respectively. Practically every financial metric has grown 90%+ in 2019 (compared to pro-forma 2018 figures reflecting the company’s bad debt expense), so I think it is reasonable to conclude that the company is able to grow its top and bottom-line by 30% in 2020. This would result in revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA of $39 million, $15.6 million, and $23.4 million, respectively.

Based off my 2020 projections, the company has a forward price/sales ratio of 1.3x, a P/E ratio of 3x, and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 2x. With 2020 EPS of $0.39 and a P/E ratio of 15 (given a 30% growth profile), the company should be trading at a price of \~$6.00 per share (\~4-5x the current stock price of $1.35). Assuming 25% top and bottom line growth in 2021 and 20% top and bottom line growth in 2022, the company should generate EPS of $0.59. At a P/E ratio of 15, the company is likely to trade at $8.85 per share. Given the growth profile of Assure, I would expect the market to attribute a P/E ratio closer to its bottom line growth profile (a company growing earnings by 20% should trade a at a P/E of 20, all else being equal). Of course, the general level of interest rates and other macroeconomic factors impact the multiples certain companies trade at; however, I believe as Assure scales, the company will attract more institutional capital and will trade closer to a P/E ratio around 20x in 2022. Assuming EPS of $0.59, the company should trade at a price of $11.80 (\~10x the company’s current share price).

Wish I could I could attatch the spreadsheets I made which more clearly display the financial ratios of Target and its main competitors (Costco &amp; Walmart). I am by no way an expert, and any constructive criticism is valued, especially if there is something I failed to miss or fundamentally don't understand.

&amp;#x200B;

**Strengths**

* Target has a higher **gross margin** (26.32%) than its peers (Costco: 12.98%, Walmart: 25.10%). This means that the company retains more capital on each dollar of sales, which can be used to pay other costs or satisfy debt obligations.
* Target has an **operating margin** of 5.58%, meaning that each dollar earned in revenue brings 5.58 cents in profit. Because its operating margin is higher than its competitors (Costco: 3.16%, Walmart: 4.50%), the company a has a greater proportion of revenue available to cover non-operating expenses like paying interest.
* Target has a **net profit margin** of 3.89%, the highest of its main competitors (Costco: 2.40%, Walmart: 1.30%). A net profit margin of 3.89% means that for every dollar generated by Target in sales, the company kept about 4 cents in profit. Retailers tend to have profit margins that are lower than in other sectors, which can run between 0.5% and 3.5%.
* Target’s **price-to-earnings ratio** of 20.01 is relatively lower than its peers (Costco: 35.53, Walmart: 23.20) which suggests the stock is potentially undervalued among its main competitors.
* Target has the lowest **price-to-book ratio** (3.26) among its competitors (Costco: 8.50, Walmart: 3.80) which suggests its stock is undervalued. However, this alone shouldn’t be used to assess whether a stock is undervalued. It’s useful to consider the P/B ratio with the company’s ROE, as they both factor in the book value of equity. Because Target has a relatively low P/B ratio and a relatively high **return on equity** (25.47%), the company’s stock is likely undervalued.
* Target’s **price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio** of (2.48) is lower than its peers (Costco: 4.49, Walmart: 2.48), suggesting its stocks is more undervalued than its competitors.
* Target’s **price-to-sales ratio** of (0.50) is lower than its peers (Costco: 0.85, Walmart: 0.55) which suggests its stock is more undervalued than its competitors. Furthermore, when complementing the company’s low P/S ratio with its high **net profit margin** (3.89%), the same conclusion can be made.
* Target’s **price-to-cash-flow ratio** of (6.35) is lower than its competitors (Costco: 20.54, Walmart: 10.17). Although there is no single figure that points to an optimal P/CF ratio, a ratio in the low single digits may indicate the stock is undervalued
* Target’s relative low **enterprise value to EBITDA** of 11.25 (Costco: 20.06, Walmart: 11.37) indicates that the company may be undervalued

&amp;#x200B;

**Good, but Not the Best**

* Target has an **interest coverage ratio** of 9.15, meaning it has around nine times as much in EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) as in debt interest. Although Target is more than able to cover their interest expense with their earnings, the company has the lowest interest coverage ratio among its top competitors (Costco: 32.15, Walmart: 9.67). 
* Target’s **return on assets** (7.30%) is between its competitors (Costco: 8.49%, Walmart: 3.15%). Every dollar that Target has invested in assets generates 7.3 cents of net income, Costco 8.49 cents and Walmart 3.15 cents. This means that Target is better at converting its investments into profits compared with Walmart but not as good as Costco.
* Target’s **return on equity** of 25.47% is significantly higher than Walmart’s return on equity of 8.87% but slightly less than Costco’s return on equity of 26.10%. A return on equity of 25.47% implies $0.25 returned on every $1 invested. Target’s relatively high return on equity suggests the company efficiently uses its stockholders’ equity to earn profits.
* Target’s **earnings per share** of 5.56 is between Costco’s (8.32) and Walmart’s (2.28). With a higher earnings per share, we can assume that Target is performing better than Walmart in terms of profitability. This is also reflected in the gross profit margin and net profit margin 

  

**Weaknesses**

* Target has the lowest **quick ratio** (0.20) among its peers, with Costco’s and Walmart’s quick ratios being 0.52 and 0.23, respectively. With a quick ratio under one, the company does not have adequate current assets to cover short-term obligations. However, this is not a significant issue, as the retail sector has traditionally had a very low quick ratio. Companies leading the retail sector typically negotiate favorable credit terms with suppliers due to their dominance over the market.
* Target’s **receivables turnover ratio** of 74.28 is much lower compared to its competitors (Costco: 95.32, Walmart: 86.48), indicating that the company’s collection of accounts receivables is inefficient, and that the company has a high proportion of customers that are either not financially viable or creditworthy. Whereas it takes a around four days for Costco and Walmart to collect its accounts receivables, it takes Target about five days to do so. 
* Target has a significantly lower **inventory turnover ratio** (5.90) than its peers (Costco: 11.80, Walmart: 8.80) which means the company is selling goods at a slower pace and there is less demand for the company’s products. It takes Target approximately 62 days to sell its inventory on hand while it takes Costco about 31 days and Walmart about 41 days.
* Target’s **asset turnover ratio** of 1.88 is lower than its competitors (Costco: 3.54, Walmart: 2.43), signaling the company is not efficiently using its assets to generate sales. For every dollar in assets, Target generated $1.88 in sales, while Costco and Walmart generated $3.54 and $2.43, respectively. Target’s low turnover may indicate that the company is experiencing sluggish sales or obsolete inventory. Furthermore, its low inventory may also mean the company the company has lax collection methods.

**The Bottom Line:**  In comparison to its peers, Target Corp. struggles to effectively use its assets and manage its liabilities in the short-term. The company’s collection of accounts receivables is inefficient, likely a result of lax collection methods, it sells goods at a slow pace, possibly due to less demand for its products, and the company may be holding obsolete inventory. With regards to liquidity, Target and its top competitors all have a quick ratio of less than one which would indicate that the businesses are not able to meet short-term obligations. However, this is not an issue, as large-cap retailers typically negotiate favorable credit terms with suppliers due to their dominance over the market. The company outshines its competitors in terms of profit-generating abilities. Target retains a great deal of capital on each dollar of sales, it has a large proportion of revenue available to cover non-operating expenses, and it keeps a considerable amount profit for every sale it generates after accounting for all expenses, costs, and cash flow items. Although not up to par with Costco, Target is better able to convert its assets and stockholders’ equity into profits than Walmart. Finally, when examining the company’s market prospect ratios, Target appears to be undervalued when considering its low market value ratios (P/E, P/B, PEG, P/S, EV/EBITDA). 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla’s stock price has left orbit, not unlike one of founder Elon Musk’s Falcon 9 rockets. But there are those who think it might soon plummet back to earth.

J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, in a research note on Friday, urged “extreme caution” regarding the shares of the maker of electric vehicles, which he said could drop 58%.

Tesla’s shares (ticker: TSLA) are up about 35% this year and 90% in the past 12 months. Shares closed at $564.82 on Friday, down 1.3%. Brinkman reiterated his Underweight rating.

Such a bearish tale won’t surprise investors. Tesla is a controversial stock. The average analyst price target, for instance, is well below where the stock trades. Still, investors have been piling in. The surge began last year, when Tesla beat expected third-quarter earnings projections after months of turmoil. Since reaching a 52-week low in June last year, shares have climbed more than 300%. A new plant in Shanghai began production within a year of groundbreaking.

But Brinkman isn’t buying the hype. “Better deliveries, better earnings, and on-time start of production in China seem the likeliest catalysts, but a closer look suggests less enthusiasm may be warranted,” he writes.

Having eclipsed Volkswagen (VLKAF) as the world’s second most valuable auto maker, the German giant’s dominance in China should provide an apt benchmark from which to measure success. But market capitalization means little when it comes to sales.

Tesla sold 367,500 cars in 2019, just 3.4% of Volkswagen’s total the year prior. Compared to General Motors  ￼(GM) and Ford ￼ (F), Brinkman doesn’t think Tesla has the tools to keep up with its lofty valuation. The company is facing new challenges in 2020. Federal tax credits are dissipating and start-up costs in China will take their toll.

Investors expect Tesla to ultimately generate more than $9 billion of free cash flow annually, but similar to comparisons to Volkswagen’s size and profitability, it seems premature, given Tesla’s history of negative free cash flow, Brinkman wrote in his report.

# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**
*****
&gt; With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.
*****
&gt; The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&amp;P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.
*****
&gt; Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed’s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.
*****
&gt; There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.
*****
&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.
*****
&gt; “It’s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.”
*****
&gt; Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.
*****
&gt; “You could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,” said Krosby. “We had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings roll out
&gt; There are more than 135 S&amp;P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald’s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.
*****
&gt; Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.
*****
&gt; “Coming into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.”
*****
&gt; Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there’s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.
*****
&gt;#  Fed is big story but won’t say much
The Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it’s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.
*****
&gt; “The big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that’s going to be the key messaging,” said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think the data has been okay. There’s really nothing new there. The only thing that’s really new or interesting is going to be what’s going on with the balance sheet.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.
*****
&gt; Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.
*****
&gt; Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed’s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.
*****
&gt; For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. “The intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed’s target range, ” he said.
*****
&gt; Besides the technical move, they “may be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Economic data
&gt; There’s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter’s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.
*****
&gt; New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid

&gt; Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.

&gt; As of yesterday’s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA’s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&amp;P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.

&gt; In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday’s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.

# Another Look At Election Years

&gt; Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn’t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.

&gt; We’ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we’d take another look at this impactful year.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500’s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.

&gt; “Stocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; From a quarterly view, the S&amp;P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That’s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.

# Recession Watch Update

&gt; As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it’d be a good time to check on LPL Research’s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.

&gt; As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn’t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle’s continued durability.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:

&gt; We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It’s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.

&gt; We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&amp;P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&amp;P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.

&gt; “We remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.”

My background; three years of work experience in the financial services industry for a large global firm in the area of asset management. My role is centred around financial statement analysis and basically, just due diligence into the fundamentals of a company. 

Anyways, the reason I decided to write up this guide for /r/stocks is that I frequent the subreddit quite often and although there are a few good posters here and there, it seems there is a lot of misinformation that goes around, and thus, I wanted to set out a foundation for a due diligence template that new investors can use so that they can have some sort of basic guideline in terms of what to look out for before buying or selling a stock.

---

# 1) What does the company do?

Step number uno; figure out what the company does. This is where google is your friend. Simply type up the company's name or ticker into google and read what it is they do.

If you don't understand what it is the company actually does after looking through google, don't invest.

If the company deals with complicated business models that require technical knowledge which you don't have, for example; an early-stage biotech undertaking Phase II clinical trials, don't invest.

If the company is vague about what it does or you're using google translator to read their business description, don't invest.

Generally, the more complicated the business model of the company, the riskier it is to invest. This includes conglomerates that may be involved in many simple business ventures individually, but when bunched up all together, it becomes complicated to analyse and thus, the risk to invest increases (e.g. GE -- to this day, I still think no one knows what they actually do).

So you're probably wondering by now, what is all this talk about *risk*? Don't worry about that for now, we will get to it later I promise.

# 2) News

In other words, what is currently happening with the company? There is no point wasting your time to research on further sections of your due diligence process if the company has publicly stated its intentions to file for bankruptcy.

Contrary to step 1, this is where google might not to be your friend. There tends to be a lot of spam articles, advertisements or just plain misinformation on google news. Normally, I just spend a minute on google news before doing some more serious research on better news site such as [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) (again, simply search the company name).

Do not slack off here. The easiest way to lose money is to buy into a stock when litigations or liquidity concerns are going on which you could had easily avoid with a few minutes of reading the news.

Another reason why the news is important is that it can tell you things that aren't on the financial statements. What you read on the news can and 99% will impact the subsequent steps of this guide i.e., financial statement analysis.



# 3) Revenue drivers

How does the company make money?

Revenue is the second most important thing on a company's financial statements.

If you're going to read only one thing on a company's financials (which I seriously suggest you do not do), then that one thing should be revenue.

Now, I'm not going to go into too much detail of why revenue is important. That's not the purpose of this guide, I'm not here to teach undergrad finance.

Essentially, just imagine I'm offering you to buy my lemonade stand. Now ask yourself *how you should go abouts* figuring out how much you should pay for the lemonade stand. If you don't know the answer to this, read up on the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) and [discounted cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp).

Anyways, let's move on. Revenue can be found on the first line item in a company's income statement. The breakdown of revenue (i.e., the drivers) can be found in the segment reporting section of the financial statements (just ctrl+f and look for 'segment').

A quick sense check I like to do here before doing anything else is revenue growth over market cap growth for the most recent period (use excel).

If market cap growth is outpacing revenue growth, that's already a bad sign. Keep in mind that it's not an absolute indicator you should steer away, but it's just a quick and dirty calculation that gives you a general idea of where the stock is at in the market.

The two common reasons for why market cap growth is outpacing revenue growth is either that the stock is overvalued or that the market is predicting exponential revenue growth (i.e., revenue growth in the future should outpace this period's market cap growth).

Next, let's figure out the revenue drivers.

Most companies will have multiples revenue streams relating to different business operations, thus, it is important to figure out which one of those streams are driving revenue and by how much -- revenue stream divided by total revenue.

Then, we look at the growth of each revenue stream over the most recent periods. Simply looking at revenue on its own is useless without looking at growth.

Assuming you have done both of the above and listed them in descending order, you should now be able to determine which ones are the core revenue drivers.

Personally, I like to use the [BCG Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth%E2%80%93share_matrix) as a guideline when looking at the qualitative nature of the revenue drivers but everyone has their own way of doing things.

If the company is generating most of its investments from Dogs, that's probably a bad sign.

Again, I'm not going to go through what each combination of the BCG Matrix means, have a read through the wikipedia as the information is all there.

This is usually the time when I can determine whether I should spend additional time analysing the company or move onto the next.

If you proceed, here is where things start getting quantitative and time intensive. 



*Note: In case some of you do not know where to get a company's financial statements, go to the [SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). Simply search for the company's name, then search for filling type '10-K'.*

**To be continued in Part 2**",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,475141,public,self,Financial Due Diligence - Guide [Part 1],0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/etoyfk/financial_due_diligence_guide_part_1/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,
[],False,InterestingNews1,,[],,text,t2_uipg9,False,False,[],False,False,1579941731,self.stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/etoegp/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/,{},etoegp,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,,dark,text,False,False,True,14,0,False,all_ads,/r/stocks/comments/etoegp/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/,False,6,1579941732,1,"**Value Stocks (Bed Bath and Beyond, Subaru and Express)**

Barron’s round table last weekend highlighted a couple of interesting opportunities, namely Bed Bath and Beyond and Subaru. 

After years of poor performance, that has seen the stock price fall by 80%, **Bed Bath and Beyond** ($BBBY) appointed a new CEO Mark Tritton in October last year.  Mr Tritton has an outstanding track record, having previously helped turn around Target and Nordstrom.  His speciality is improving merchandise and reducing the cost of private label.  

That’s particularly relevant for Bed Bath who have seen their margins fall to just 3%.  If Mr Tritton does what he’s demonstrably good at and implements better sourcing, cost-cutting, and sales growth -- then margins could double, earnings should grow to about $4 to $5 a share and the stock could rise from $16.35 on Friday to $45 or higher.

That sounds very achievable on paper.  However, what makes it more interesting is that Mr Tritton is backing himself with an equity heavy package.  Instead of looking for cash he has taken $1 million - $2 million in cash with the remaining $8 million - $10 million in stock.  That means his interests are aligned with stockholders and that he sees upside in owning shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Also highlighted by Barron’s was **Subaru** ($FUJHY).  Subaru is one of the lowest-cost car producers and yet one of the most profitable, with 9% margins. 

Its stock is very cheap (trading at nine times next year’s earnings, with a 5.4% dividend yield and 30% cash-to-market cap) because the market is concerned that volumes are about to peak.  However the economics look good.  Subaru’s cars are taking more market share (4% in the US) and consumers are shifting to sport utility vehicles which cost more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Elsewhere, clothing retailer **Express** ($EXPR) shares jumped 20% on Wednesday following plans to shutter 100 stores by 2022.  The move is expected to cut costs by $80 million and boost profits by $15 million annually.  Additionally,  over the same period, operating lease obligations are expected to drop by $85 million. 

These are both significant amounts for Express and should provide a significant boost to its $80 million trailing EBITDA.

It’s no surprise then that the stock price rose 20%.  However Express’ valuation still looks incredibly cheap -- even after the increase. Its enterprise value is just $142 million with a market cap of $309 million, $167 million of cash and no debt the enterprise value. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth Stocks (Ollie’s Bargain Outlet and eHealth)**

**Ollie’s Bargain Outlet** ($OLLI) shares hit a 52 week low on Tuesday before rebounding.  However, as of Friday’s close, the stock was still down 40% from the all time highs set in May last year. 

I am not surprised the stock is rebounding.  The company had a bad start to the year in Q1 and Q2 as poorly-timed inventory decisions led to an excess of out of season goods and rapid expansion led to some cannibalization of sales.  However Management’s assurances that set backs were temporary proved to be true as strong Q3 results in December beat expectations. Net sales increased 15.3%, operating income increased 22.0%, adjusted net income increased 28.3% and the company reaffirmed full year guidance.

Longer term, the potential for growth is very good. The company has 345 stores in 23 states and plans to increase its store count nationally to over 950.

The stock is currently trading on 26x trailing earnings. That looks cheap for a fast growing “off price” retailer with big plans that is (once more) executing well.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares of **eHealth** ($EHTH) jumped 27% on Friday after the online health exchange provider announced that preliminary Q4 revenue will be between $257.5 million and $259.5 million with earnings between $53 million and $55 million (c.$2.34 per share).  Consensus estimates were for Q4 revenue of  $194.9 million and EPS of $2.15. 

Business is picking up for eHealth and the trend seems likely to continue.  An ageing U.S. population, with the 65+ population expected to increase from 40 million in 2010 to 80 million in 2030, will mean more people buying private health insurance to enhance Medicare for decades to come.  Additionally, its likely that those purchases will be made increasing online, where eHealth has established itself as a leader in a very fragmented market.

The stock is priced on 50x 2019 estimates but with 50% growth and a bright outlook the valuation looks very reasonable.

eHealth CEO Scott Flanders said, ""We remain excited about the Medicare market opportunity and significant growth potential ahead of us and are looking forward to sharing our outlook for 2020 as part of our fourth-quarter earnings release next month."" 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pharmaceuticals (TherapeuticMD)**

**TherapeuticMD** ($TXMD), a commercial-stage biopharma focused on women's health, jumped over 20% on Tuesday after it was reported that JP Morgan had taken a 7% shareholding.  

The company has three drugs on the market (Imvexxy, Bijuva and Annovera) with combined peak annual sales estimated at $1.85 billion.  Be that as it may, TXMD is still in the early stages of building demand with trailing revenues of just $40 million.  

The investment by JPM is important as the company burns through its $155 million of cash and investors look for signs that management is capable of delivering commercially.  Reassuringly JPM’s move follows recent purchases in the past six months of $300,000 by the CEO and $400,000 by the company President.

Considerable risks remain with TherapeuticMD and its plans to develop commercial sales.  However, I would say that with a market cap of $672 million compared to forecast peak sales of $1.85 million, the rewards should significantly outweigh the risks.

Pros:

Richard Branson is a well known billionaire that is straight forward and successful. 

It’s geared towards tourism, unlike Blue Origin and SpaceX.

It has already sold 625+ tickets for $250,000.

It’s expecting to make $800 Billion by 2040, roughly 33,000 passengers per year. So, less than 1% of the top 1% of Americans alone.

Based out of Las Cruces for low cost and taxes.

Cons:

According to recent studies, the flight has a .05% chance of crashing. Compared to a 1.3% space shuttle or a .0004% commercial flight, that’s pretty good. For every 1000 flights, that’s 5 crashes. 

It will take 6 people, so $1.5 million a flight. 

Cons:

Blue Origin being a competitor.

People view it as a gimmick, less interest in the years to come.

Flight could crash into a satellite or back onto Earth.

Could lower cost of ticket to help raise interest levels. 

Elon Musk says screw it and makes SpaceX compete. 

Could be viewed as bad for the environment. Maybe they can make it sustainable or neutral. 

All in All:

I can see this stock doing extremely well in the years to come. It will essentially have a global monopoly on a commodity that doesn’t exist yet.

- This is for a Roth IRA. I'm in my 20s. 

- I want to get this decision right early on (i.e. now) so I can have a portfolio which I don't mess with ever going forward. Once I have the fund for like 5 years (hopefully stacking up lots of compounded returns) I'll be less likely to mess with it and trade around, which is I think will be very beneficial. 

- I prefer funds, so I can be 100% invested. I guess I'm a bit OCD and I hate seeing $84 left in cash. I also think that having ETFs just encourages me to check the market more often (to see my money going up or down mid-day) which encourages trading which I wont to avoid at all costs. 

- I do prefer mostly US stocks (hence only %20 international).

- I use Schwab so I can buy Vanguard funds unless I want to pay a $49 fee EACH TIME (i.e. each year) I contribute. 

- The SFENX has a .39% fee which is just kinda aweful. I'm tempted to go 100% SWTSX

#[Today's Top Headlines for Friday, January 24th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/coronavirus-closes-shanghai-disney-tech-layoffs-and-stumpf-ban.html)

* U.S. stock futures are pointing to a higher open ahead of the Friday session, with the final disposition of the holiday-shortened trading week still to be determined. The Dow is currently on track to post a losing week, its second in four weeks, while the Nasdaq is likely to rise for the seventh week in a row after a record close Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 is just below breakeven for the week, and would post its eighth weekly gain in since weeks if it can erase that deficit. (CNBC)
American Express (AXP), a Dow component, releases earnings before today’s opening bell. No major earnings reports are scheduled after today’s closing bell, and no economic reports out today. (CNBC)
* Dow stock Intel (INTC) was rising 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and revenue after the bell Thursday. Results were helped by improvement in personal computer and data center demand, and Intel also gave an upbeat current quarter outlook as well as announcing a 5% dividend increase. (CNBC)
* A large broadcast satellite, owned by AT&amp;T’s (T) DirecTV, built by Boeing (BA) and operated by Intelsat (I), suffered major damage to its batteries in December and is now at risk of exploding. The satellite is notably several years beyond its intended lifespan. (CNBC)
* Boeing reschedules 777X plane’s first test flight for today (Reuters)
* China’s National Health Commission said as many as 26 people have died from a fast-spreading coronavirus, as the total number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 830. Multiple cases of the virus have been confirmed in Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea and Japan, while the United States, Taiwan and Singapore have each reported one case. China has extended its travel ban to 13 cities, covering 35 million people. (CNBC &amp; NY Times)

* Social controls, SARS experience help China close off cities (AP)
* Walt Disney’s (DIS) Shanghai Disney Resort will be closed until further notice to help China stop the spread of the flu-like virus, costing the theme park operator revenue during the country’s biggest holiday season. China is on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, a period when the Shanghai Disney park would be usually packed with tourists. (Reuters)
* The World Economic Forum is wrapping up today in Davos, Switzerland. A Hong Kong property developer said the U.S. chose the wrong decade to start a trade conflict with China. “They should have picked the war 10 years ago,” said David Chiu, chairman of Far East Consortium International. (CNBC)
* George Soros rips Trump and Xi, says the ‘fate of the world’ is at stake in 2020 (CNBC)
* Soros says Xi is the ‘most dangerous’ opponent of those who believe in open society (CNBC)
* Soros warns Trump of potential economic doom before election (CNBC)
* Soros says Elizabeth Warren ’is the most qualified to be president’ (CNBC)
* Democrats will press their final day of arguments today before skeptical Republican senators at President Trump’s impeachment trail, focusing on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress’ investigation. House prosecutors made an expansive case yesterday that he abused power like no other president in history, swept up by a “completely bogus” Ukraine theory pushed by attorney Rudy Giuliani. (AP)
* Former VP Joe Biden leads other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, while several others appeared to be gaining momentum in their bid for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll. The online poll showed that 24% of registered Democrats and independents supported Biden, while 20% backed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and 12% said they would vote for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren.
* The Trump administration is set to release a report today that outlines its short-term and long-term plans for enlisting e-commerce companies to combat counterfeit products on their platforms. The Wall Street Journal reported that law enforcement will begin identifying cases immediately and “seek all available statutory authorities to pursue civil fines and other penalties against these entities.”
* J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon got a 1.6% raise to $31.5 million for his work in 2019 after his bank posted record earnings and shares of the company surged. Dimon’s compensation package includes $1.5 million in salary and $30 million in performance-based incentives. (CNBC)
* The U.S. government announced that former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf has been banned from ever working at a bank again and will pay $17.5 million for scandals in which millions of fake accounts were set up to meet sales quotas. Regulators plans to target other individuals, including former executives, for their role in the scandals. (CNBC)
* Home DNA-testing company 23andMe is laying off about 100 people, or 14% of its staff, on Thursday, in the wake of declining sales. The company plans to tighten its focus on the * DTC business and its therapeutics arm while scaling back its clinical studies arm. Additionally, TripAdvisor is planning to cut 200 jobs, or 5% of its total workforce. (CNBC)
* Jim Lehrer, co-host and later host of the nightly PBS “NewsHour” that for decades offered a thoughtful take on current events, has died. He was 85. Lehrer died “peacefully in his sleep,” according to PBS. He had suffered a heart attack in 1983 and more recently, had undergone heart valve surgery in April 2008. (AP)

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

First off as the title states I think there will be a correction in the near future. Take this with a grain of salt but this is only my opinion but we have multiple bubbles brewing. I always advise dollar cost averaging but I would also recommend holding a healthy amount of cash. Now I am leaning towards cash because the market is strange to say the least. 

When the correction happens, it will be catastrophic. I know it will impact everyone but I believe it will hit millennials and 60+ the hardest. 

Below are the bubbles I see:

60+ effects: Health care costs: Health care inflation rates have outpaced wages for decades. This will affect everyone but mostly older adults because it is the time in their lives that they typically need care. A larger and larger % of their money is dedicated to costs each year. Why is this bad? As elderly run low on money more and more will slip into poverty. This takes money out of the market/economy, and will begin to stress the medical system, especially Medicaid which is gradually lowering benefits.  As Medicaid begins to fail/reduce benefits/reduce payout the medical institutions will have to learn to recoup cost from another source, AKA the rest of us not using the services. Combine this with the exploding aging demographic the current infrastructure is in danger. The premiums for the average family are already over 1200$ per month, + whatever deductible, + plus bullshit out of network expenses. To me this is the scariest bubble we have over the next 2 decades. 

Housing: effects millennials and 60+: How does this effect both? Home prices have also been outpacing inflation consistently. On top of this the average new home built is significantly larger and more expensive. This restricts a lot of new home buyers (typically age 25-35) from entering the real estate market. Homes have historically been one of the primary sources of family’s net wealth as they age (equity grows via inflation/down payment). On top of this because younger adults are being restricted from buying homes they are forced to rent, which further delays them because rentals all over the country have also been steadily increasing in rates. Meaning younger adults are losing out on years of a crucial long-term investment. Here is the kicker though, many adults retiring were expecting to sale their homes and downsize. This process of transferring wealth potential to younger generations is eliminated because the younger generation does not have the money. Now the retiring adults are stuck with a home with higher expenses, until they can sale at a rate lower than they expected. 

School debt: This will effect mostly younger adults &lt;35: This basically builds on the two above. National student loan debt is close to $1.5 T (T = TRILLION). Young adults with an education are typically defined as the middle class because with the education they have higher earning potential. Due to the increasing student loan debt many are unable to take the “risks” and “opportunities” the older generations could afford to take. Student loan debt not only restrict them from homes, but it also delays many from investing in the markets long term. Which is devasting long term if you invested 500$ monthly at 8% for 30 years starting at 0 you have 750k$ if you had 40 years of growth it is $1.75M that is a 1,000,000 difference……. Basically, the demographic which would typically support the economy/market is being severely limited. I WILL CAVEAT THIS if you go or went to school for a degree which had no earning potential and came out with massive debt I am sorry, but that was just stupid on so many fronts on your part, and mostly your fault.

Oil: Effects everyone: Our global economy is based on oil. Oil is already struggling due to demand being too low and supply too high. As global sentiment continues to decrease towards the industry and new innovative technology is released to replace oil the demand will further deteriorate. What is going to happen is the big companies like OXY, EXXON, BP, CHEVRON, etc will survive and absorb some smaller entities. However, many of the less profitable sectors will erode leaving ghost towns and 100,000 of thousands of people out of work. The industry that takes its place will be a shell of itself. Cities across the country are already starting to ban 1-time use plastics.

Wages: effects all: Combine all the above with wages being stagnant over the past decade. 

Yet again take my advice with a grain of salt: However, we are now in the longest bull market in history with unprecedented growth. Which is why I am invested in cash, total market index funds, and individual stocks with a strong dividend.

TLDR: medical sector, student debt, homes prices have been increasing and hinder growth, major market players being disrupted, wages stagnant all lead to an economy which is not going to be sustainable long term.

&gt; ***Hi r/stocks! I am just putting out next week's most anticipated earnings calendar a day earlier than usual due to not being able to get around to do this tomorrow or this weekend. I really don't like to post these up any earlier than Friday's because sometimes the calendars can look a bit wonky where you might see some companies on the calendar that are actually not scheduled to report, or are reporting on another day, etc etc. but unfortunately I don't really have much of an option here...it's either putting this up now or no earnings thread at all for next week. Anyway, please do me this favor everyone and review carefully the companies that are scheduled to report on their respective days for next week. Admittedly, I did not get a chance to confirm all the companies that are on this week's calendar are actually reporting, but if you see something that doesn't look right, as far as a company that is listed up on this calendar on a particular day that isn't expected to report, please just post a little notice in this thread so that everyone is made aware of it! I'd greatly appreciate that. It's very possible that there are some company logos on this calendar that are misplaced here. FWIW, I do not create these calendars. These are coming straight from EW (Earnings Whispers). Thank you!***

The federal government’s [“public charge” rule](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/11/20899253/trump-public-charge-immigrants-welfare-benefits-court) would determine whether immigrants are more likely to use public benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid; those who couldn’t satisfy 20 different factors for economic self-sufficiency would be denied entry. The rule has faced a number of courtroom challenges that so far have prevented it from going into effect. Now, a handful of tech companies have signed [an amicus brief filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (PDF)](https://assets-wp.boundless.com/uploads/2020/01/Public-charge-amicus-for-Boundless-et-al-CA4-FINAL.pdf), putting their public weight behind rescinding the rule.    

Those companies argue that the rule will prevent them from hiring the talent they need. From the filing:

&gt;“American businesses depend upon an efficient immigration system to ensure that they have access to the talent that they need to grow and succeed. Although the American-citizen workforce is highly skilled, businesses sometimes benefit by hiring foreign nationals for certain positions, often sponsoring these workers for permanent residency. Immigration law has long recognized that, in such circumstances, businesses require pathways (such as H-1B and L-1 visas adjusted to 5 employment-based permanent residency) for foreign nationals to come to and remain in the United States to work… The Rule, however, would restrict American businesses’ ability to hire foreign-born workers, because, under the Rule, many skilled workers who would otherwise have been eligible for permanent residency would now be barred from receiving it.”

In other words, these companies feel that the rule is too broad: “Given the numerous and amorphous factors—and the unfettered discretion given to immigration officials—virtually any applicant could be found to have some basis for a denial.”

&gt; Financial systems may confront an abrupt increase in risk aversion, with a corresponding surge in demand for liquidity.

The base is then capped at $160k! With the rising equity value, everyboy feel rich and they use that appreciation to buy rising price houses, etc. 

What happens if there is a long. hard correction? These employees will get wiped out 20-30% of their annual salary. This never happened before (employees get compensated mostly in stock). The snow ball effect will be devastasting. Companies won't be able to switch back to normal compensation.

I am opening up a TFSA and will contribute 6k and invest it in RBC Direct Investing (this is the only one I can use due to work)

I know this comes up a lot here and I did do my research but Reddit is awesome because there is sooo many smart people here and the answers are original. 
 

What do you think about these ?

WALT DISNEY CO (DIS)

NETFLIX (NFLX)

FACEBOOK  (FB)

STARBUCKS (SBUX)

MICROSOFT  (MSFT)

UBER (UBER)

VANGUARD TOTAL STOCK MARKET INDEX FUND (VTSMX)


is there something else I should look into? Is there something else that is much cheaper that has good potential ? Maybe 5G technology?

Also, Im bad with allocation... what allocation should I have in each if I have 6k ?
At the same time, im thinking maybe there will be a correction so perhaps it’s not the best time to buy?

Is everything expensive?

Some background about me:
23 years old, currently, my role is an Associate (Im in the process of getting licensed)

I know I can ask my colleagues, but I work in a huge institution and I find most of their investment style is focused more towards capital preservation.

Im looking for growth &amp; long holds.

Many of you will disagree and say TSLA is bound for the stars (and maybe it is), but it’s only an example so let’s not get caught up in arguing its price, value, etc. For the sake of discussion only, let’s say it’s a bubble.



If you’re confident that something is riding a massive and unsustainable market hype train, is there anything really wrong with climbing aboard for the sake of profits **as long as** you’re able to restrain your greed and exit well before the pop?

But, in a nutshell I primarily use them as a tool for analyzing and picking stocks and also keep tabs of all my stock holdings in the portfolio that you can create.  

The first section I looked at was the dashboard which will show your portfolio metrics that tracks your performance &amp; rating,  investment ideas based on analytics and stocks in your portfolio, and the latest market news.  

Next tab, Research Reports that will give you access to the newest,  freshest reports pertaining to the market and individual stocks you want to monitor. You can just plug in a stock like MSFT into the search box and it'll pull reports from like Argus.  Kind of cool to see their perspective and ratings and how they build portfolios.

Last tab, Investment Ideas will help you generate ideas based on filters  such as, Bullish and Bearish, Technical or Fundamental Analysis,  Sectors, Short, Medium, Long Term holding and Buy, Hold, or Sell  Ratings.   I like this the most as you can play around with filters and gets some of ideas of stocks to want to add to your watch list.  I'd never just blindly follow analysis of course so definitely make your own investment decisions and do your own research.

To sum up, I personally don't think it is worth $34.99 a month or $349.99 annually.  But, it  is an interesting tool if it fits your investment style and strategy.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I'm assuming I should sell now since it's at the buyout price and invest into something else so I dont waste time. Any thoughts on what to replace it with? My portfolio is a little overweight on energy/utility but I love that sector so I'm not totally opposed to buying something like BEP to replace it, but I'll only have about $500 to throw around at it.

So basically a wash sale is if you buy a $10 stock then sell it the same day for a $5 loss, then re-enter for $5 and sell it again for another loss say for $3, then thats considered a wash sale right?

But what if you consistenly make wash sales with your losses? In the above example lets say you lost -$50K with the same stock or similar priced stock, but with your other trades you made $10K in profits for the year. If a wash sale NEGATES your capital losses, wouldnt that essentially mean you made $60K in GAINS for the year and must pay taxes on that amount even though you're actually down -$40K gross profits?

Or what if you made $20K in gains and -$10K worth of wash sales? Do you get taxed on $30K in capital gains since the wash sale rule negates the -$10K as a loss?

And how about if you consistently re-enter a stock everyday but instead of losing money each time, you profit everytime you re-enter sell and repeat.

These twin crises, industry insiders say, spring from a culture that consistently put short-term rewards to shareholders ahead of engineering-driven decisions and long-term strategy. For all of Boeing’s business coups and innovation, one stark statistic has come to symbolize the company’s priorities: Over the past six years, Boeing spent $43.4 billion on stock buybacks, compared with $15.7 billion on research and development for commercial airplanes. The board even approved an additional $20 billion buyback in December 2018, less than two months after the first 737 Max crash, though it subsequently shelved that plan. 

But the fallout from the Max crisis may well push Boeing in the opposite direction. Costs related to the Max have topped $9 billion and could easily double. To shore up its balance sheet Boeing is reportedly considering borrowing money to pay shareholder dividends—and cutting R&amp;D spending. Those are steps in the wrong direction, says Epstein. The only way forward is to put investors’ short-term interests on hold, he argues: “If you don’t do that—if you cut R&amp;D, cost-cut, give cash to shareholders—then you’re playing with Boeing’s future.” ",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,471721,public,self,The forces behind Boeing’s long descent,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ercx84/the_forces_behind_boeings_long_descent/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,[]

I am 25 and this past year I finally started thinking about my retirement. I've done some research on the stock market to get a general idea of different trading strategies. In everyones opinion, what is the best way to get the absolute most bang for your buck for long term investing (25+ years)?

I am stuck between choosing these 3 different strategies:

1. Opening a Roth IRA and investing in only a total market ETF and Mutual fund and MAYBE investing 10-20% of my portfolio in 1-3 tops blue chip stocks (AAPL, V, MSFT for example)

2. Having a taxable stock account where I invest half of my portfolio in a blue chip stock when it dips and then selling it when it shoots up e.g. BA right now, AND a Roth IRA for the other half of my portfolio with a total market index fund (looking at VTI) and/or mutual fund.

3. Investing in 10-20 low risk blue chip stocks in a Roth IRA for 50% of my portfolio and the other 50% of my Roth IRA in a total market mutual and/or ETF.

Option number 2 clearly has the most risk involded but possibly the most reward if executed rationally? What strategies does everyone else employ that work for them? Any tips or suggestions on strategies, stocks, ETFs and Mutual funds would be helpful. Again, I've done a fair share of research but am still newb.

I should also add that:
 -I currently make 28,000 a year
 -My salary (fingers crossed) SHOULD
  increase by 10-20 thousand this next   
  year if all goes well with getting a new
  position in the laborers union and then 
  slowly increase each year after that.
- I currently have 6,000 to start investing.
-In a few months I will be completely debt free and be able to devote 50-60% of my earnings towards investing.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,471667,public,self,"25 year old new to stock market, seeking advice/opinions for best long term strategy",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/erb4ld/25_year_old_new_to_stock_market_seeking/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,[]

Friend was thinking about buying. But then he read insider info that the owner sold his shares at a lost. Big red flag. So he bailed, and Krogan was no longer on his radar.

2 years later. Krogan is chugging along just fine. Would have been a 3x profit.

&amp;nbsp;

This got me wondering. The idea of owners selling their shares being a red flag. It does seem intuitive.

And there's been examples in the past. Mark Cuban broadcast.com etc.

But how often does the reverse happen? For every broadcast.com, how many turn out to be Krogan?",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,471460,public,self,If you have insider info.

I wanted some constructive criticism on my due diligence and whether you guys think the stock price is overvalued. 

background info on the company: small-cap company; single-source vendor of hydrogen fuel cell tech, operating in the same space as conventional batteries. Products are focused on materials handling (ie. forklift operation in warehouses) and stationary power (ie. telecommunications) sectors. 

DD: I'm struggling with the fundamental analysis of this company b/c they're negative earnings, therefore, traditional stats like P/E ratio aren't applicable. 

- quarterly net revenue is increasing 
- quarterly net income is negative 
- basic and diluted EPS is negative 
- quarterly operating cash flow is negative but they're steadily closing the gap 
- Amazon recently inked a deal with PLUG that gives them the option to buy 55 million shares (worth up to $600 million) 
- Amazon also committed to purchase $70 million of fuel cell products for its warehouses and distribution centers
- PLUGs major clients for materials distribution tech include BMW, Mercedes, Amazon, Walmart
-PLUGs major clients for stationary power tech include AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Southernlinc
- Price to shares ratio = 4.93 vs. industry average = 0.8729
(take that with a grain of salt b/c the industry average is taken from Emerson Electric Co and Cintas Corp - both LARGE cap companies, &amp;  Wellbit Inc - SMALL cap)
- comparing P/S to other small cap companies:
PLUG = 4.930
Ballard Power Systems = 28.87
Wellbit = 1.354

Don't know what to make of the P/S, seems like its pretty variable within the sector. 

Thoughts?  

Thnx. :)

In this piece by *The Drive*, the author proposes a scenario in which John Deere slowly loses its customer base by creating a technologically advanced product, raising prices to the point that older loyal customers are turning to secondary used markets to fulfill their equipment to needs. 

Agriculture has long been an industry participated in by few, but contributes the sustenance of many. Ag has high upside when producers can maximize efficiency, find production equilibrium with supply needs through economies of scale (which allows for fewer producers to need to play and those producers increase the size of their enterprise). But in order to really make economies of scale advantageous, it requires mechanized help. 

John Deere tractors are your flagship tractor. When you think of tractors, the green with yellow accented behemoths tilling those fields are probably the first that come to mind. But what happens when farmers begin to look at secondary markets to satiate their equipment needs when the producer of their prized equipment no longer is working with their customers to meet their needs? 

[Newer models can run upwards of $300,000 for a rig](https://www.fastline.com/farm-equipment-for-sale/listings/john-deere-tractors/results?category=Tractors&amp;manufacturer=John+Deere&amp;minprice=220000&amp;page=1) even on the used market. Why pay $200,000+ for a machine that you could buy for $30,000 thats 40 years old? In fact, farmers are turning to these older machines because they are less complicated to fix. But the demand for those older models are actually driving up the prices in the secondary markets because sellers realize how valuable their old machines are becoming. 

John Deere tractors are becoming more technologically advanced, but this may not be a good thing. Deere is raising the prices of their machines, and making it such that farmers are looking to used markets to find older machines. If you’ve ever worked on an old car, you can think of it in the same manner—the older tractors are very barebones and mainly mechanical. If you understand how to repair the machine, it’s a fairly straightforward process. 

Not only is the upfront cost a factor when it comes to investing in one of these machines, but maintenance repairs is a contributing factor. These newer machines have technological locks built into the operating systems that limit private owners from performing their own repairs on the machine, forcing them to contact the dealership, have them send out a mechanic representative at the dealerships convenience, potentially holding up production for extended periods of time. This puts the farmer’s operations at a reduced level unnecessarily, and at a greater cost, than what they normally would repair themselves.

Due to this, farmers have found an outside solution to this roadblock Deere corporate has put in place to lock the technology systems of the machines: [Ukrainian software hacks.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware). [October of 2016, buyers were required to sign a licensing agreement forbidding the repair and modification of farming equipment.](https://www.deere.com/privacy_and_data/docs/agreement_pdfs/english/2016-10-28-Embedded-Software-EULA.pdf)

Is John Deere alienating one of its leading sales segments? With international trade agreements being formed, amended and expanded—soybean, grain and corn is going to be in great demand. Farmers are going to need equipment that fulfills their operations, small or large scale. These new equipment prices, in addition to prices to maintain the machines, are going to be passed onto consumers, ultimately driving up prices for some of our most common goods. Why pay more than you have to for a machine today when one three decades old can be refurbished and folded into operation for significantly less cost? 

According to their financial statements, FY 2019 revenue was the first year since FY 2014 that it was greater. Bringing in $39.26B in 2019, 8.9% greater than the second highest year this decade in FY 2014 at $36.02B. $DE’s brought in a net profit of $3.25B in FY 2019, up 2.8% from FY 2014. FY 2015-2018 all showed negative growth from the peak in 2014 if omitting 2019 data. 

With John Deere and Caterpillar ($CAT) being some of the leading manufacturing segments in the United States, is manufacturing at risk if $DE doesn’t change their business model to be more accommodating to their customers? $DE and $CAT are both major construction equipment manufacturers, with Caterpillar leading over Deere in that segment.

From John Deere’s financial statements, they revenued $20,511B in Ag sales (84% of total sales), compared to construction at $3,831B (16% of their equipment sales). So clearly, their ag customers will have significant leverage if a portion of them begin to look in the secondary markets for used equipment they can fix themselves, or even if they purchase new equipment, but use this Ukrainian hack to crack the operating systems of their machines and fix it themselves. 

With agriculture being Deere’s most prominent segment, if they don’t begin to accommodate their farmer customers more carefully, $DE could begin to face sales pressures in the next coming years. The commodities will be needed to be farmed with or without Deere, so will they bend the knee? Or continue in an adverse customer-producer relationship that ultimately may hurt the company. If Deere doesn’t change their business model, they may eventually price themselves out of the market.

TL; DR: if John Deere doesn’t start making efforts to work with the customers as opposed to trying to squeeze every penny out of them.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,471037,public,self,Farmers Are Buying Up Old Tractors Because New Ones Are Pointlessly Complicated and Expensive | Is John Deere alienating customers by pricing themselves out of the market?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/eqxroz/farmers_are_buying_up_old_tractors_because_new/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,[]

I've been investing for about a year now and thought it was time to take a swing at swing trading. I'm fairly new to technical analysis, but I have recently been learning the basics to it. I'm considering taking my first turbo position tomorrow on the stock PostNL (PNL) and would like your opinion on it. I'll run my thoughts down for you here:

The stock's had a fairly rough 2019, plummeting from 2.5 to 1.4 between May and June. I've done my fundamental DD on it, since I was also invested in it for its recovery to 2.0 in the few months after that. Recently PNL has plummeted again due to some bad merger news. In my personal analysis I have concluded that the company is worth a lot more than the current cap of 885M (euro's) because, among other things that I won't get into here, it's the only postal delivery service in my entire country (The Netherlands) and has a fairly stable income in a growing industry.

For the technical side: I'm considering the stock, because i saw a series of red candles with an inverted hammer at the end. In the little knowledge of TA i have this could mean that the stock is going to bounce back. The RSI is also fairly deep into oversold territory (about 20 at the moment).

I'm considering buying a 5x leveraged turbo (""Postnl BNP turbo long 1.57) IF the stock opens positively tomorrow, possible confirming a reversal and an uptrend. My goal would be around the 2 euro's mark and my stoploss would be at around 1.69. This equals a ratio of about 3:1 regarding profit/loss.

What are your thoughts on this? If anyone with more experience thinks I'm being ridiculous, please let me know ;). I'm open to all comments.

&gt;... There is no rule for determining what size of correlation is considered strong, moderate or weak ...  
&gt;  
&gt;... For this kind of data, we generally consider correlations above 0.4 to be relatively strong; correlations between 0.2 and 0.4 are moderate, and those below 0.2 are considered weak.  
&gt;

They're the only one with that capability.

They've been around for like 2-3 years now, but they have been laying groundwork during that time, building a team, etc. They have one building in operation in Canada. It just went to 24/7 operation 5 days a week. They have a few more buildings opening up in latter 2020. One in Germany and two more in Canada. Final production will be hundreds of thousands of kilograms a year. Stock is at about 27 cents per share now. I know that generally ""penny stocks"" are looked down on. This company used to be at like $1.50+ per share. It went down as people became frustrated due to the company literally just starting out then. 

This past fiscal quarter, the company turned its first official profit because they were focusing more on producing instead of just laying ground work and building. They were processing $20+ million in biomass. It was about 1.2 million dollars of earnings for this past fiscal quarter, if I remember correctly. The next fiscal quarter in a couple of months is estimated to produce 10-12 million and the one after that is estimated at 12-14 million.

# **Earnings will decide whether the market continues to hit new highs after another week of records  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/earnings-will-decide-whether-market-continues-to-hit-new-highs.html)**
*****
&gt; With the Chinese trade deal out of the way, earnings could be the biggest driver for stocks in the week ahead, as big tech, financial, consumer and industrial companies report.
*****
&gt; So far, the early rush of earnings are beating estimates at a pace of about 70%. Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.
*****
&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.
*****
&gt; But it’s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market’s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.
*****
&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.
*****
&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.
*****
&gt; “2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,” said Golub. “I think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.”
*****
&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. “The first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,” Golub said. “The same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.”
*****
&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.
*****
&gt; “While everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they’re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,” he said.
*****
&gt; The hearings on Trump’s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.
*****
&gt; “Will there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,” wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. “Let’s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum — for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/‘the anti-Trump’, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the ‘anti-Trump’ vote — a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.”

# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately

&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market’s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.

# A Closer Look At Election Years

&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 31% total return.

&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.

&gt; “If an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “On the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.”

&gt; Note that a “lame duck president” means the sitting president either isn’t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a “lame duck president” both years.

&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a “lame duck president”.

&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market’s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can’t always tell you who will win in November.

# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020

&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.

&gt; We’ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market’s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “We expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “With valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.”

&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6–7% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.

&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.

# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start – But 2nd Half Is Weaker

&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today’s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.

&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.

&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.

# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks

&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month’s end.

&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth “Lame Duck” Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other “Monthly Barometers” using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite

&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing “Last 11 Mon” years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 –19.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.

&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.

&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader’s Almanac) reports at month’s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow’s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.

# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout

&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).

# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline

&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.

&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.

Forgive me as english isn’t my first language and I just started with stocks so I absolutely have not enough knowledge thus i’m asking for some speculation or any opinion. Anything is welcome and would be highly appreciated. I’ve been reading a lot of news and tech stuff as well to be updated on stocks.

I just wanted to know would shorting stocks be better for a quick way to earn 20%-25% in 5 years? Or would investing on an ETF be better?

I have around $1000 on my portfolio with. 3.99% FIT, 13.03 AMD, AAPL 54.6%, MSFT 28.52% and currently looking to reinvest like $1000 per month. I’m currently looking into BABA, DIS, MCD, for ETF’s FTEC, QQQ, VGT and VOX. If you think it would be better for me to diversify my portfolio please let me know.

**Medifast** $MED, the weight management company, presented at the ICR conference on Monday and restated its goal to double in size every 3-4 years and targeted 2021 revenues of $1,000 million (2019 guidance $700-$710 million)  That’s reassuring after a disappointing Q3 when the company was hit by a credit card fraud.

The stock dropped 29% after those results which seemed a little harsh since the issue was fully resolved, revenues still managed to grow 36.5% and guidance for the full year forecast 40% revenue growth and 26% EPS growth.  It’s not as if Medifast was trading on a big multiple.  The stock has since recovered from the post release drop and then, as it is now, trades on around 2x trailing revenues and 20x trailing earnings.  Pretty reasonable for a growth stock.

The problem is is that Medifast has been tarred with the same brush as Herbalife and other multi level marketing schemes which use agents to promote sales.  However, the model is quite different. Medifast sells direct to the customer.  Its agents don’t get discounts or handle stock.  That means Medifast isn’t artificially boosting sales by recruiting and selling to its own agents.

A few years ago the company was a quiet and essentially family run affair.  That was until Dan Chard was appointed in 2015.  Formerly the President of Global Sales and Operations at Nu Skin he was the right person for the job.  He developed the Optavia Diet brand and put in place the direct marketing business model. Sales exploded from $273 million to $689 million in less than four years.

With a product that works and a growing level of demand (driven by obesity) coupled with a capital light highly scalable business model and effective management, Medifast looks very attractive.  The company also has a potentially huge global opportunity but only recently moved to grow internationally with expansion into Hong Kong and Singapore 2019.  Europe and South America and Australia would also make excellent markets.

CEO Dan Chard’s comments this week suggest the bright outlook has not changed.  2021 targets for revenue of $1,000 million and 15% operational margins remain.  That  would generate net income of $115 million if we apply the current effective tax rate.  The $115.58 stock price at Fridays close would represent a forward earnings multiple of just 11.7 (TTM PE 19). With a strong growth forecast, the stock looks cheap.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Cardlytics** $CDLX reported preliminary Q4 revenues this week that were up 44% at $69 million and thrashed estimates of $59 million.  The digital advertiser uses a proprietary native bank advertising channel that enables marketers to reach consumers through their trusted and frequently visited online and mobile banking channels.

However Cardlytics’ main advantage is the use of purchase intelligence outside the banking channel to boost advertising effectiveness. It’s not difficult to see why knowing what customers have bought in the past is a good predictor of what they will buy in the future.  The company claims that its return on ad spend (ROAS) is 10x the industry average at $30 for each $1 spent. 

The stock price has risen 22% since the announcement but (valued at 11.3x revenues) still looks reasonable compared to peers such as The Trade Desk (valued at 21x). With a huge ROAS advantage, it seems likely that strong growth will continue.

**Value Stocks (Samsung, Signet and Fluent)**

Fool.com reported that this is an exciting and pivotal time for NVIDIA. The company remains at the forefront of gaming and is well placed to thrive in the new frontiers which lie in data center, artificial intelligence, and automotive applications.  However, if the valuation at 35x forward earnings is too much for you (and you don’t mind looking abroad) then perhaps **Samsung Electronics** ($005930.KS) is a better buy. 

Samsung has a dominant position in memory chips and memory demand is exploding with the roll out of 5G and applications in artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The company is currently trading on just 9x last years earnings. Additionally, net cash (including short term investments) is equivalent to a remarkable 25% of its total valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Signet Jewelers** $SIG stock price jumped 40% on Thursday after the company reported a significant beat and raise. The company, whose outlets include Kay Jewelers, Zales and Jared, said comps were up 1.6% as a 13.5% growth in digital sales helped offset a 0.2% decline in brick and mortar sales.  That’s encouraging as it seems jewelry buyers switching to online channels prefer to buy from names they know and trust.  The retailer still faces headwinds but its valuation doesn’t look expensive.  EPS guidance was raised to $3.42 to $3.56 from $2.99 to $3.26 meaning, even after the recent price jump, the $29.52 stock is valued at just 8.4x earnings.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Fluent, Inc**. $FLNT announced on Tuesday that it expects to exceed its previously provided guidance for full-year 2019 with revenue now anticipated to be $280.8 - $281.8 million, representing growth of 12% and an increase from previous guidance of $265 - $267 million. 

The company operates in a fast growing, fast changing and competitive sector - digital marketing. It has built up a huge database of (150 million+) that it can target on behalf of clients. It uses competitions to get details and, importantly, gets consent from clients to contact them. A former CEO has said that if European data protection laws were introduced in the US it would give Fluent a huge advantage as it (largely) already has consent. Indeed Europe offers a huge potential market for Fluent and the company has already reportedly started testing in the UK.

The news this week is an important development for Fluent whose stock has not had a good year. The data driven digital marketer is down 60% (with a valuation of 0.8x sales and 1.1x book) from the years highs after reducing guidance, not once but twice.

In fairness, management have been clear throughout that the outlook for the core advertising platform remains very good. The drop in revenues and rising costs are due to the company exiting peripheral ventures that have been explored and not met revenue/return targets (as well as a couple of bad debts deemed unrecoverable). 

The recent results support that thesis and suggests growth should accelerate once the headwind of exiting non core businesses passes.

**Insider (RumbleOn)**

Both the CFO and a director at **RumbleOn** $RMBL each picked up $114,000 of stock on Tuesday following $90,000 of purchases by the CEO last month.  (Warning RumbleOn is a high risk nano cap stock)

Make no mistake RumbleOn is tiny with a market cap of just $16 million.  A development stage e-commerce platform that facilitates consumers and dealers to buy, sell, trade, and finance pre-owned recreational vehicles. It primarily focuses on pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other powersports and also provides third-party financing services.  However, it is growing rapidly leveraging its capital-light network of 17 regional partnerships and disrupting the old-school pre-owned vehicle dealerships.  Thats a massive and highly fragmented market with around $1 trillion of sales.

RumbleOn expects to achieve its first quarter of EBITDA profitability in 2020 and have a full year of EBITDA profitability in 2021. That seems reasonable given recent growth.  In November Q3 results reported revenues of $220 million compared to just $19 million in 2018. Last week the company reported preliminary results expecting full year 2019 revenue range to $837.7 million to $840.7 million compared to $156 million in 2018.  Margins are tight but the company is moving swiftly from dealers to consumer sales which are almost three times are profitable.  

RumbleOn CEO Marshall Chesrown said “We are pleased with the progress we are making” going on to add “We continue to expect an acceleration in unit and revenue growth in the first half of 2020”.   

The company is a high risk development stage nano cap with dilution being more of a certainty than a risk.  However its fast growth suggests it is resonating well with users and, if it is even slightly successful in winning a small share of the huge vehicle sales market, current stock holders should do very well.
