I'm new to this.

About a month ago I took a strong position (for me) in CEMI with the plan of riding it to it's consensus target. 

Well, it's hit that target, and according to the plan it's profit taking time.

It's not money I can't lose. If the whole thing went poof I'd be pissed but otherwise fine.

However, I'm re-evaluating... Based on the news I keep seeing and because the company appears to be doing well, I believe it may go higher still. I am wondering if it may be worth letting it ride for a bit.   
However, again, I'm new to this and everything I keep reading says make the plan and stick to it...

After many fails in recent weeks with day trading trying to be smarter than the market and trying to time it - lesson learned. Speculation is not for me. Back to regular investing. 

I currently build a portfolio with:

JNJ - for long term its a good stock overall. ER looking ok, involved in COVID cure, good future outlook. 

Microsoft - leading software for work, gaining with systems for work from home. Azure Cloud looks like one of the market favorites. 

SAP (xetra) - its either Workday or SAP. I think SAP will continue its growth in Europe. Pandemic should help with moving to newer software for companies. Next week ER coming in. Good perspectives

PHG - also before ER, the last contract for respirators looks good. One of the biggest medical devices providers currently. Huge on eu market. 

Salesforce - also a CRM like sap but different usage. Golden standard for many software solutions. Should also gain from companies moving online. Especiallh that it heavily supports working from home

All obove stocks are meant to be kept for a long time. All as per my analisys undervalued currently. Nothing is pandemic proof, but I see the above as stocks not going to be heavily affected with corrections or with a good perspective to rebound.

I have two stocks I'm holding with the thought they might tumble so I have them as riskier assets. Ready to cut profits.

Netflix - I think ER will be great for Q1. Might decline afterwards, but for now looks like a growth. Overpriced for sure. 

Tesla - holding big hopes for their battery technology. Also the world wont stop moving to EV because of COVID. I think its overpriced, but with a good outlook for growth. Stop loss set though for cutting profits. 

On my watch list to swap in case Netflix or Tesla will go down:

Biogen / Inseego / Citrix / Pfizer / 3M

The closest was the 2008 MBS crisis. There are people who will point to repo interventions and pre-corona liquidity exercises the Fed carried out but it is nothing but business as usual to ensure ample liquidity.

So I see so many throwing out the Great Depression as the parallel and predicting doom - I’m sorry, what we have in our hands now is a different beast altogether. Uncertainty for sure but literally impossible to have another Great Depression style of collapse, esp the length of ten years that lasted till WWII

#Gold Standard
Let’s get this thing out of the way. We are no longer in a gold standard and that gives a lot of freedom to ensure money supply. Aka print money out of thin air. You can point to the ballooning national debt. However, as Abenomics prove, debt is not a bad thing as long as you owe most that money to yourself and there are suckers available to buy government bonds. This is a topic unto itself and is another debate 

#Banking crisis
This is the only parallel. Just like in 1929-30 there is a steep drop in manufacturing because of the lockdown in several countries, esp China. This led to banking crisis in the early 1930s and it can easily happen now (hence the plummeting of bank stocks). However, the Fed learned from the mistakes of 1930 and seems to be acting swiftly and ensuring money supply and reserves are in motion for banking institutions. The Fed was slower to act in 1930 and that accelerated the recession

Also, key point that Fed decision making was decentralized in the 1920s. Every district had a governor and consensus was hard

#consumer 
All through the early 30s, it was extremely difficult for the people to borrow. They had no credit to go buy food or materials and stock their shelves. Being unable to borrow let to extreme and severe poverty - like bread lines. Also, there was no concept of cheap Chinese goods. Much of our supply line was local 

#government missteps
This is the elephant in the room, unless you dig up history. The FDR government rolled out some crazy policies which greatly prolonged the depression. There’s NIRA where the government heavily intervened and started fixing hours, wages and even item prices in order to eliminate “competition”. It messed with the natural equilibrium price movement in an otherwise free market and lasted till 1935 when SCOTUS ruled it unconstitutional 

Then the WPA which sent unemployed workers to work on government projects like building roads, schools and parks. Also the AAA which instead of helping farmers get back to production, allowed them to get government subsidies and not till their lands. This led to food shortages that have way to the infamous bread lines they always associate with the depression 

Even prior to FDR, Hoover was an extremely interventionist President. Very high min wage, very high taxes and plenty of government projects which produced little to no value to the exchequer 

I don’t see these things happening now. If anything, there’s going to be multiple rounds of stimulus unless some form of drug or vaccine is on the table.

Not even the best fintech stock in the decade after the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009 could hide from the coronavirus. **Mastercard** (NYSE: MA), the world's second-largest dedicated digital payments platform, has been hit hard by the contagion. At its lowest point last month, the stock was down over 40% from its all-time high, although as of this writing, it has recovered some of those losses.

Nevertheless, the coming economic downturn means less movement of money. For a toll-booth business like Mastercard that earns the bulk of its revenue by charging a small fee for processing transactions, that means leaner times lie immediately ahead.  

Though the world has undeniably changed a great deal because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mastercard is in good shape and should emerge stronger than ever. The short-term outlook isn't great, and shares remain priced at a premium, but the long-term reasons for owning this war-on-cash leader are unchanged.

Tear up those 2020 forecasts

Even after toppling from its highs, Mastercard stock still trades at a premium price point: 36 times trailing 12-month free cash flow (what's left after cash operating expenses and capital expenditures are paid out). It's an especially high price considering the company added itself to the large and growing list of businesses downgrading expectations for the coming year. Management pulled its outlook for full-year 2020 revenue (previously pegged at a low-teens percentage increase) and downgraded its first-quarter 2020 revenue guidance to low single-digit percentage growth. Operating expenses should grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range, which includes the $250 million Mastercard pledged to support small businesses impacted by the coronavirus.

That could imply very little growth in earnings -- or even a bottom-line contraction if operating expenses grow significantly faster than revenue. With the stock priced as if Mastercard will continue growing at a fast but steady clip for the foreseeable future, suffice it to say coronavirus and the disruption it has brought on the world is unwelcome news.

The war on cash was never going to be won in a year

Nevertheless, a bad quarter or even an entire year is no reason to part ways with a long-term winner like Mastercard. Ample profitability means the credit card and payments platform will be able to navigate the crisis without the need to take on new debt. This isn't just a short-term trend either. As digital payments have grown as a percentage of the global transaction pie, profit margins have steadily gone up.

Plus, digital payments are still a high-growth industry. Global revenue generated is expected to climb by high single-digit percentages for the next few years, according to McKinsey and Company. Most of the world still deals primarily in cash, so there's plenty of room for companies like Mastercard to continue making the push toward a more digitally based system of money movement. The company's immediate-term outlook, though lowered significantly, is a testament to that. Many organizations are foreseeing a drop in sales, but Mastercard is still looking at year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Some of that pertains to the acquisitions made in recent years, and more takeovers could be in the making. The outlook could also change in subsequent quarters, but at this point in the crisis, it's so far, so good.  

And then, there's the situation with China. Long walled off to foreign payment platforms, Mastercard got approval in early 2020 from the People's Bank of China to begin setting up operations. Entering the massive country -- home to the world's largest base of digital consumers -- will be an uphill battle against the virtual duopoly on the Chinese digital payments market between **Alibaba** and **Tencent**. But Mastercard is still generating plenty of growth from other emerging markets. China should thus be a notable addition that could help maintain growth for many more years.

A premium price for a best-in-class company

As a final consideration, Mastercard ended 2019 with $8.53 billion in debt, not a huge sum considering this payments giant generated $7.46 billion in free cash flow last year. Additionally, cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet totalled $7.68 billion. High-profit margins, plenty of liquidity, and global secular trends favouring the industry it plays in add up to make Mastercard a best-in-class fintech stock.

The price tag on shares remains high and the immediate outlook uncertain as to the world reels from the effects of the pandemic, but Mastercard is still a staple portfolio holding for the long term.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,383339,public,confidence,self,Is Mastercard Stock a Buy?,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g1oqan/is_mastercard_stock_a_buy/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It isn't like small businesses turn a 180 and start improving on revenue.

The rebound by the U.S. stock market off its March 23 coronavirus low is impressive, but it might be predicated on the wrong question, according to one analyst.

“Most of the analysts are asking—‘When will the economies return back to work?’–which we believe is the wrong question,” said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of BK Asset Management, in a Tuesday note. “The much more relevant question is**—‘When will aggregate demand recover to pre-virus levels?’** That is a much more difficult dilemma to assess given the massive damage done to consumer balance sheets.”

Signs the COVID-19 pandemic is peaking in Europe and the U.S. have fanned buying interest for equities and lifted investor appetite for risky assets. Some European countries have started to lift restrictions on movement and activity, while U.S. politicians are [scrapping over the timing](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-do-you-choose-between-economic-deaths-of-despair-and-coronavirus-victims-economists-lawmakers-grapple-with-a-moral-conundrum-2020-03-26?mod=article_inline) of a reopening and [who has authority to decide](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cuomo-fires-back-at-trumps-ultimate-authority-comments-the-constitution-says-we-dont-have-a-king-we-didnt-have-king-george-washington-2020-04-14?mod=article_inline).

Stocks were higher Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **+2.48%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) up more than 500 points or 2.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 index [**SPX,** **+3.09%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) advanced 2.5%. Stocks set back modestly on Monday, with the Dow finishing 25.8% above its March 23 low, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 23.4%. That left the Dow 20.9% below its all-time closing high set on Feb. 12, while the S&amp;P 500 was 18.4% below its Feb. 19 record close.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs this week [threw in the towel](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-sachs-abandons-its-bearish-near-term-view-on-stocks-says-the-bottom-is-in-2020-04-13?mod=article_inline) on their near-term bearish forecast, which had called for the S&amp;P 500 to test 2,000, arguing that the March 23 low would mark the bottom. Like other bulls, they argued that the flattening of the so-called viral curve combined with unprecedented rounds of monetary and fiscal stimulus by the Federal Reserve and U.S. government made it unlikely the market would carve out new lows, barring a second wave of infections down the road.

Others have argued that the rally will give way to renewed selling pressure as the damage to the economy from lockdowns becomes apparent and uncertainty about the shape of the economic recovery remains.

tomorrow Schwab will present its Q1 Earnings. Yahoo is asking: [Will Higher Client Activity Aid Schwab (SCHW) in Q1 Earnings?](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/higher-client-activity-aid-schwab-144602066.html)

Here I am gonna shortly present you why it will.

**TLDR: Call on Brokerages like Schwab/IB/E\*Trade**

&amp;#x200B;

Due to high volatility (that will stay high for many weeks) and many people staying at home, we will see increased income of online brokers and banks in the field of equity commissions.

Thesis: Trading transactions increased (obviously). This leads to more commission for the brokerages and banks. And, this effect is significantly stronger for retail trading.

&amp;#x200B;

This can be seen in this examples.

**TL;DR**

The first milestone prediction is wrong.  The Indian stock market continued to rise despite an extension of the lockdown and growing infections.  It did not fall back to 7800-8000 as predicted.

**How do you feel now?**

Whilst I still stand by the thesis and we still have 5.5 months for the prediction to expire it is looking more and more like the Federal Reserve expansion of credit facilities and junk buying will maintain the asset values.  At present, credit providers are likely to get paid twice (once by stimulus going to consumers to pay off bills and then again by purchasing of defaulted debts later on).

**How are your bets down?**

I didn't hedge and the primary losses were sustained in the drop in the Vix to today's monthly low.  I also left some positions open overnight and they didn't decline on negative news but did increase wildly on positive sentiment.

**Were any of the commenters right?**

The original post had a ton of valuable and respectful discussion and was fun to write.

Another use disagreed and he has turned out to be absolutely correct.  Praise to u/green9206 and I owe him a beer.

Several posters did comment that the Federal Reserve are likely to be successful.

**Have any financial personalities blown your thesis away?**

Well, yes.  In particular  [https://twitter.com/DiMartinoBooth/status/1250066951281532932?s=20](https://twitter.com/DiMartinoBooth/status/1250066951281532932?s=20) who quotes that  predicts stocks hit all-time highs w/i year &amp; that investors who fight new &amp; improved Fed will get burned to a crisp as they’ve been assured they’ll be made whole by JaPo.

**Why did you write such a long and intense post?**

Good question.  Mainly for the enjoyment.  It forced me to be bold in my own predictions.  It forced me to confront my own biases and it also forced a greater understanding of financial theory.  Also, the comments forced me to admit the gaps in my ideas and it was a good thing to invest time in.

**What do you think will happen next?**

Honestly.  I have no fucking idea.  I comforted by the sheer amount of hedge fund managers, investors and analysts on Twitter saying the same thing.  We are living through unprecedented, wildly volatile times.

I am a beginner and new to stock-market so this might be a dumb question.

I believe major US brokerage platform like Robinhood or TD Ameritrade offer real time stock bid and ask price.

Does this mean that members of the major platform be able to check the current bid and ask price and quantity before placing a bid?

I am currently residing in New Zealand and as far as I know, most of NZ Brokerage firms do not offer real time data and my guess is that it might be hard to place a bid or sell a stock and decide the price without checking who is currently bidding and selling and their bidding or asking price.

I'm thinking about selling them to free up some capital to take advantage of cheap prices.

One stock I'm looking at is Citigroup.  Prices were at around $80 before the crash, they're at around $45 now.  The value of my Amazon shares would get me around 250 shares, which if they returned to the $80 value would net me just shy of $9k.

There are a number of stocks out there that fit these criteria, but my take on this question would be OpenText (OTEX). They might be relatively well known, but I feel like they are not mentioned enough as a solid long term investment opportunity. They are a Canadian software company with their headquarters in Waterloo, Canada. They have been the biggest software company in Canada since 2014 and have a market cap of 13,49 billion. At the time of writing their stock is trading at 49,82 CAD, which is a 21,27% drop from their ATH of 63,28 CAD on February 14th of this year. Their recent lowest point as of right now was 42,64 CAD on March the 23rd. They have a relatively solid balance sheet, but have to content with the recently acquired debt they took up to purchase Carbonite for approximately $1.45 billion.

They have been on a steady upwards trend for the past 10 years and with their 2019 acquisition of data protection specialist Carbonite, they are well positioned to make an impact on the ever growing cloud infrastructure in both the US and Canada. With more and more companies moving their operations to the cloud, a company like OpenText can become a key figure in storing and securing important information for these companies like Google Cloud, Microsoft and Bank of America.

With all that being said, I would love to know what your underdog stock is and why you think more people should be aware of it or even add it to their portfolio. Best of luck with investing in these uncertain times.

I've been following THC (Tenet Healthcare Corp) --  My average PPS is in the $12's..  
I have 700 shares..  So its kind of a big thing for me!!

PPS Currently at $18.81..

I am still up almost 60%

Ive been waiting for another bounce and an exit.   The stock Very quickly went above $22 last week and I missed it.  (Doubt I coulda made the sale that quickly anyway!)

PPS is still only 1/2 of what it was 2 months ago.

Very undervalued.

It opened higher today but quickly sank and was down 5.xx% at close..  It struggled to gain back losses all session and it had a mini-rally at the end of the day. 

Its early still and I know anything can happen, but right now, if it matters, futures are looking Great.  Dow is +388.5 right now..

Hopefully this chart insert works.  Its simply Barchart.com, candlesticks, volume on, and check out 1 day, 5 day, 30 day..  pretty please??

Despite these positives, several important factors, including long-term market psychology, technical-cycle analysis, valuation, and smart investor behavior, suggest that this bear market has not yet seen its low point.

**1. Investors are too bullish:** Let's start with long-term investor psychology. In the past few weeks, I have received numerous questions from readers to the effect of, ""I am a long-term investor, should I be putting some money to work in the stock market here?""

If we were to change our viewpoint from an anecdotal to a more formal data perspective, the [New York Fed](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=575327ba48cfb91361f713fa1&amp;id=2f0737dc61&amp;e=73e9fc941b&amp;mod=article_inline) conducts a regular survey of consumer expectations. One of the survey questions asks if respondents expect higher stock prices in the next 12 months. Instead of fear, investors are exhibiting signs of greed. Investor psychology just doesn't behave that way at major market lows.

MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert made a similar point about his sample of market timing newsletter writers in a recent [Wall Street Journal article](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=575327ba48cfb91361f713fa1&amp;id=4042bd1209&amp;e=73e9fc941b&amp;mod=article_inline). While market timers were fearful at the end of the March quarter, their fear level was nowhere near the levels seen at past market bottoms.

This is not time to relax. The bear market is not over.

I’ve got £5,000 give or take which I can add too over the next few years, intention being is to build up enough funds to have a deposit for a house (circa £20,000 or so).

Before the crash he made a forecast of it in the 2,600 - 3,200 price range.  2,740 was  the high.

Explaining how he seen the crash from here setting up, Jones (Whilst still long the market) said a lot of market players where thinking a high could come somewhere in that space.  Inevitably at some point there'd be a downturn. People would start to wonder if that'd been the high and when it next fell many players previous content being long would all want to exit at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

He called it,  ""The famous Acapulco cliff drive. How fast can you hit the bottom"".  The papers called it ""Black Monday"".

&amp;#x200B;

Video of Jones calling this move - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sfHklc8vM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sfHklc8vM)

&amp;#x200B;

He isn't saying these things now. He's saying he [thinks prices will bounce back in a couple month](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/man-who-called-1987-crash-says-be-careful-not-to-mythologize-coronavirus-into-a-pandemic-godzilla-predicts-stocks-will-rebound-in-a-few-months-2020-03-26) (doesn't say back from where, and the devil is in the detail), but though the last couple years we have seen big market players starting to talk about a top.

&amp;#x200B;

Ray Dalio has been talking about there being problems ahead for a while. Various times through interviews he's used the same phrase Jones uses, talking about when the ""Next downturn comes"". He talks of a squeeze.  He apparently was caught out a bit at the high, but do you think he's changed his mind now he sees the downturn?

Dr Burry [spoke of a passive investing bubble](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/5-calls-big-short-michael-burry-passive-investment-bubble-2019-8-1028487875#michael-burry-called-passive-investing-a-bubble-1). His comments where he didn't know when it'd happen.  The longer it went on the bigger the pop would be. Do you think maybe now he's seen the downturn he might feel like he has a better idea of when it could be?

Soros said in January [Trump was an egomaniac that had created a bubble](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/george-soros-warns-trump-of-potential-economic-doom-before-election.html) that could pop before the elections. Anyone know much about things Soros likes to do?

Around the 8th of March we broke the [200 SMA on the weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/kud1az8rzks41.png?width=1051&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1a2cd805da1282dcc556ea70670d18b2d20d1db). Do you know how often that happens? Not often. Most of the false breaks only go a tiny bit under it. It's rare to see a break under it and another candle lower. Recent times we've seen this were 2,000 and 2,008. It broke, in the following months it retested it, and then came the big cliff dive.

**TL;DR**  


&gt; A hundred per cent decline in profits, as flagged for the most optimistic scenario, in para 2 , would take profits to zero. Sixth para from the end states that the best case is a halving of returns on equity - ie a decline of 50%.  This seems more likely.   
&gt;  
&gt;Even the most optimistic “rapid rebound” scenario, where relative normality is restored in six months or less, could lead to a 100 per cent decline in profits this year, according to a new report co-authored by Oliver Wyman and Morgan Stanley.     
&gt;  
&gt;In a more pessimistic model — dubbed “deep global recession” and lasting a year or more — some weaker banks would slump to big losses. In this scenario, credit losses could surge to between $200bn to $300bn, compared with $30bn to $50bn if a rapid rebound unfolds.   
&gt;  
&gt;Germany’s struggling lenders Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank are the worst positioned among big banks, having little or no profits to absorb a wave of loan defaults. Meanwhile Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and UBS are the European players best positioned to cope, largely thanks to their shift away from investment banking towards wealth and asset management.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,379826,public,confidence,self,Investment banks braced for pandemic earnings wipeout - DB and Commerz most vulnerable,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fztyk1/investment_banks_braced_for_pandemic_earnings/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '6ZuhZ-Par0GXFMeyi-O9qZlU9StPVJapTGdueQqDLpg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xeJiQVyKe-b5gaJht47c19QJsqvVjvorQpM5h4EPkAc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=352d6590e91a49f2fb3d7a836f8c31b1a470013c', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xeJiQVyKe-b5gaJht47c19QJsqvVjvorQpM5h4EPkAc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a161360cebb922641b5ee0bdc011d812a1a81aa1', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xeJiQVyKe-b5gaJht47c19QJsqvVjvorQpM5h4EPkAc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6830c1f3f234d7c61cfb8844faa30758d6cf73e4', 'width': 320}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xeJiQVyKe-b5gaJht47c19QJsqvVjvorQpM5h4EPkAc.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44b48fa3ce7a0d55edd4ea91ddca9955bcab1dfa', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 525, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xeJiQVyKe-b5gaJht47c19QJsqvVjvorQpM5h4EPkAc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0c70d1728d448d18d598bcc4d2989054efb710cb', 'width': 700}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was $37. Now, it is $43

I didn't buy because I don't have any investing/trading experience and I didn't want to play around with my savings. However, now I see it'd have been a good buy. At least, in the short term.

The way I saw it, oil companies were suffering the sum of two turmoils; their own price war, and the global CV crisis. During several weeks, I paid attention to some oil stocks (United States Oil Fund, Petrobras, Exxon Mobil, Total, and Chevron). XOM was the one that had dropped the most, and also the one that had shown the most stability in its price during the past five years. Between 2015 and 2020, XOM had always been between $68 and $90, while the rest of the stocks had higher levels of price fluctuation.

That made me think of XOM as a strong, solid company; and made me think of them coming back up to their $70-$90 as something very likely. However, many questions raised in my head; what's their long-term strategy? Are they ready for the renewable energy transition? What´s their cash situation? How important is it when it comes to long term investing? How many years should I be talking about when I say ""long term""? Two, five?

I am sharing these thoughts with you because I'd like to know what your thought process is, and what your sources of information/education are.

Here it is:

Almost every trader that is brand new to the market starts off by trading a small account, as they should. After all, why dive into the high-risk world of day trading with all of your hard-earned life savings at risk? It's best to start small and slowly grow your account, or even add more to your account in the future when you're more confident in your trading. However, most people dream of starting a small account of a few hundred or a few thousand dollars and growing it one trade at a time, which is obviously easier said than done. In this post I'll be sharing some tips and tricks that can help you **grow a small trading account**. Most of these I even used myself when I first got trading and I believe they played a big role in helping me grow my account.

Before getting to the good stuff, you may be wondering why it's actually more difficult to trade a small account than a large account. The main reason for this is because of the **P**attern **D**ay **T**rader \*\*(PDT)\*\*Rule. The PDT rule limits U.S. based traders with less than $25,000 in their trading account to only 3 day trades per 5 business days. Further limitations are placed on accounts that break the PDT rule by placing 4 or more day trades within a 5 business day period.

The PDT rule was put into place by the SEC with the hopes that it would protect new traders from trading too frequently and quickly losing their money. In reality, a lot of time what it actually does is forces traders to hold risky positions overnight that they would rather exit the same day, due to them not having anymore day trades available.

There are a few ways that new traders can, in a way, get around the PDT rule to be able to place more day trades. First, they can look into opening an offshore trading account. Now, I know it sounds a bit sketchy... but opening an account with a reputable brokerage based outside of the U.S. is a legitimate way to get around the PDT rule. The reason this works is because the PDT rule is for U.S. traders and if your money is in an account outside of the U.S, you're free to trade as much as you'd like!

Another way to increase your number of day trades, without opening an offshore account, is to have **multiple brokerage accounts**. For example, if you have $2,000 to start trading, you could open 2 separate brokerage accounts with $1,000 in each and will then have 6 total day trades per 5 business days *(3 with each account)*. If you're starting with a larger amount of money, but still under the $25,000 PDT minimum, you can even open more than 2 trading account if you'd like and will have 3 day trades in each one!

One issue you may run into using this method is that you can only have one margin account per brokerage. **Margin accounts** are required if you're someone that short sells or plans on doing some short-selling. Because of this, you should have separate accounts with entirely different brokerages. For example, one account with Etrade and one with TD Ameritrade.

Aside from the broker that you're using to do your trading, there are of course actual trading techniques and strategies that you can do with you small account that will give you better chances of growing over the $25,000 PDT minimum too. One of those strategies is to simply learn swing trading. You'll still be able to use your 3 day trades per 5 business days, but if you really want to put your money to work while your account is under the PDT rule, being able to profitably swing trade is an incredible way to grow your small trading account.

A **swing trade** is just a position held anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. This is different from day trading, which is when you exit your position the same day that it was opened. The nice thing about swing trading is that there are no limitations on how many swing trades you can place, even with a small account. One great way to swing trade is to follow stocks that already have momentum. By doing this, you're following the stock's trend rather than trying to fight it! *""Follow the trend. The trend is your friend."" -* [Jesse Livermore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Lauriston_Livermore)

You can use a screener like the one here on [finviz.com](http://finviz.com/) to find stocks that already have some upward momentum. To do this you may include ""Performance +10%"" over the past week while screening. This will give you a list of that have gone up at least 10% in the past week. Of course, you'll want to narrow it down further but this is a good way to at least start searching for some stock with some upward momentum that you may be able to get in on.

The next tip for growing a small trading account is one that should be used regardless of the trading type that you're doing, whether it's day trading or swing trading. **Risk proportionally** to your account size. This means that, for example, if you would be risking $250 to $500 with a $25,000 account... you should only be risking $25 to $50 with a $2,500 account. It's important to know your max risk before entering a trade and using the proper position size based on your risk.

Doing this will help you **prevent** any major losses and save you from blowing your entire trading account with just one bad trade!

Hopefully instead of having to worry about blowing your trading account, you'll have to worry about my next tip. Don't remove your profits from your trading account. When you first start making some money it can be very tempting to move those profits straight into you bank account, but you'll never grow your trading account this way. In my opinion, you should maybe give yourself some milestone payments along the way, but keep a majority of your profits in your account until it's grown to your goal account size. By ""milestone payments,"" I mean maybe withdraw some profits once you grow your account to $10,000 or $15,000, rather than randomly after you've made any profits at all.

**TL;DR**

&gt;Landlords are set to begin legal proceedings against retailers including Boots and Poundstretcher for refusing to pay rent despite staying open during the coronavirus lockdown.    
&gt;  
&gt;The pharmacy chain and low-cost retailer are among those who will be served with statutory notices in a bid to force them to pay up.    
&gt;  
&gt;Only 41 per cent of retailers paid rent on the latest collection day of March 25, according to data compiled by Remit Consulting from six leading property management companies covering more than 25,000 leases.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Atmore Group, a Liverpool-based landlord with £100m of property, said it would serve statutory notices for non-payment of rent to Poundstretcher and Boots on Tuesday. This gives them 21 days to respond or face a court hearing and the landlord applying to bankrupt them. ",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,379448,public,confidence,self,UK - Only 41% retailers paid rent on the latest collection day of March 25.

# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.
*****
&gt; Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson &amp; Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.
*****
&gt; “Most of the slowdown occurred in March,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Do we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You’re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it’s going to be more companies doing that, than not.”
*****
&gt; Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&amp;P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed’s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.
*****
&gt; The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.
*****
&gt; “People are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,” said Hogan. “We got another massive increase in jobless claims. That’s ignored because we’re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, ‘we know this and you should pull your guidance.’”
*****
&gt; Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv’s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.
*****
&gt; Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.
*****
&gt; Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed’s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.
*****
&gt; Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.
*****
&gt; The market will also watch Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&amp;J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.
*****
&gt; ’That’s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,” said Hogan.
*****
&gt; Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. “As we go through the earnings season, what we’re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.
*****
&gt; “As a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,” the UBS strategists wrote. “For now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.”
*****
Krosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.
*****
“The market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,” she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.
*****
Eventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . “Are they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,” Krosby said. “That is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.”

# Big Annual Declines Are Rare

&gt; Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.

&gt; “A positive year for the S&amp;P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,” noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. “We remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it’s just too early to tell.”

&gt; As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

&gt; So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&amp;P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?

&gt; Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards—potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.

&gt; We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it’s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don’t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.

# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After

&gt; Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.

&gt; In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son’s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.

&gt; Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.

&gt; The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents’ Day. The S&amp;P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.

# Gold Up, Dollar Down

&gt; For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**

&gt; With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.

# All or Nothing Days on the Rise

&gt; We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&amp;P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.

&gt; All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**

&gt; Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&amp;P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.

# Volatility Remains High

&gt; Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.

&gt; The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.

&gt; Over the last five weeks, the S&amp;P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&amp;P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**

&gt; Tuesday's rally also puts the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**

&gt; While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&amp;P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&amp;P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&amp;P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.

# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market

&gt; In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&amp;P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.

&gt; From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&amp;P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.

# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders

&gt; Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**

&gt; As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, although its performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.

The fund, Universa Investments, was founded in 2007 by Mark Spitznagel, who is also runs the fund as the Chief Investment Officer.

Nassim Taleb is Universa's Distinguished Scientific Advisor.

From 1999 to 2004, Spitznagel and Taleb ran Empirica, a hedge fund which applied very similar tail hedging strategies to Universa.

Universa made huge gains in 2008 - as the S&amp;P 500 dropped 38.5% by the end of 2008, the fund increased its investors's money tenfold.

Of course, even when a recession hits, Universa's investors won't starve - they have enough money to invest more than $50 million, which is Universa's minimum investment, and this will be a relatively small part of their overall portfolio.

Universa essentially offers a ""black swan protection protocol"", telling clients to think of the fund as catastrophe insurance that allows them to pursue returns more aggressively, without the need for more traditional approaches to risk mitigation.

Mark Spitznagel, who runs the fund, is known for the phrase:

**""I spend all my time thinking about looming disaster""**

In fact, a [Forbes profile from 2011](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0627/money-guide-11-spitznagel-black-swan-cnbc-protect-tail.html#5349ecbe3857) claims that on roughly 95 trades out of 100 they lose money, yet Spitznagel is unruffled as he sits in his office listening to classical music and losing money each day.

**To simplify, here's the essence of how it works:**

**Universa purchased far out-of-the-money ""put"" options on stocks and broad market indices.**

**A put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a set price within a specified time period. It's a bet that a stock or market is going down.**

As it is ultimately a bet, it is a very attractive market for degenerate gamblers!

If the market price falls below the agreed-upon price, you make money.

Universa makes a lot of small bets and watches most of them go bad (hence the 95 out of 100 trades they lose money line).

However, when one hits, it hits big...

**For example, back in September 2008, when the S&amp;P 500 was trading around 1200, Universa bought S&amp;P 500 Index put options with a strike price of 850, due to expire late October.**

**They were betting an “unlikely” drop would occur.**

**They paid around 90 cents for those options. By October 10th, the S&amp;P had dropped 300 points in a month. The options Universa purchased for 90 cents were now trading for $60 each. Universa cashed out of its position around $50, good for a gain of 5455%.**

Now, as a reminder, this is a hedge - investors will have a relatively minimal percentage of their portfolio in Universa.

Essentially, the fund is designed to make an absolute killing if the market crashes and therefore ensures that their investors have insurance if the market suddenly nosedives.

Speaking of diving, let's take a dive into the [Investor Letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/455607584/Universa-Letter-April-2020#download&amp;from_embed):

In what has been a terrible period for many investors, this is what Universa investors were greeted with on the first page:

**Based on your required invested capital at the start of the year, in March 2020 you experienced a 3,612% net return on capital; year-to-date you have experienced a 4,144% net return on capital.**

Spitznagel then flexes The Risk Mitigation Scorecard, which showed that a portfolio invested 96.7% in the S&amp;P 500 and *just 3.3%* in Universa's Tail Hedge fund, would have had a positive return in March, a month when the S&amp;P dropped 12.4%.

The same portfolio - which eliminates the adverse effect on compounding from downside shocks - would have produced a 11.5% CAGR since inception in March 2008 versus 7.9% for the S&amp;P 500.

(CAGR just means Compound Annual Growth Rate)

I mentioned eliminating the adverse effect of compounding from downside shocks, well this is crucial and he makes a great point here:

**Due to the mathematics of compounding, the big losses are essentially ALL that matter to your rate of compounding, not the small losses - and** ***not even*** **the big or small gains.**

This goes back to Warren Buffett's wise words:

**""Rule number one: Never lose money**

**Rule number two: Never forget rule number one""**

Surprisingly though we actually have a real historical example to look at were everyone was assuming the end of the world would happen and it nearly dead.

&amp;#x200B;

The Cuban Missile Crisis and You.

During the cold war there were around a dozen of times the world came withing minutes of all out nuclear warfare and mutually assured destruction. Most of these times were false alarms that were only stopped by a commander either going against orders or convincing others to wait for comformation that in a true nuclear attack would lead to the loss of second strike ablities and the failure of the entire MAD doctrine. Well there was one that was very much public.

The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis had Russian putting nuclear missiles off the coast of america in an allied nation after the US put nuclear missiles off the coast of Russia in an allied nation. Kennedy decided turnabout wasn't fair play started a blockade of Cuba. Russian subs moved around Cuba as a show of force, Nuclear bombers were put on high alert. Nuclear air to air missiles were put on US fighters and U-2s buzzed Cuba twice a day. 

Kennedy turns down the offer to trade taking missiles out of Cuba for taking missiles out of Turkey. Then you have a US spy plane shot down. The US openly talked about an invasion of Cuba and Russia said they would back Cuba to the hilt. And unknown to anyone but those in the military in each country there were two near misses were nuclear weapons were almost fired on the same day. Then Kennedy blinked and both sides agreed to remove their short ranged ballistic missiles as a trade.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might thing that the market would react rather poorly to a possible invasion much less the threat of nuclear war.  Well we can look at the numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you pick out the start and end of the Cuban Missile Crisis? It is all withing the normal day to day \~1% or less volatility.  Though the market did actually trend downward.

Thursday morning PM i bought in and was out with 15% before lunch I later bought back in at the same price I bought PM and this is now a long term hold for me and suggest u check this ticker out! And thats the way this goes usually if Institutions and banks or who ever feel the need to rush into a position they use the dark pools to buy a large amont of stock with out driving up the price . That means something is going on and they dont have time to sit back and accumulate dips like they usually do . There is more on how this all works in my bio on my patreon page please check it out and this $10 fee is not going to be around forever. After I accumualte users and word gets around price is going to double . theres also a VIP account option where i will run any ticker u send me through the larger program and post the results for u .

Apple Inc. and Google unveiled a rare partnership to add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a person with COVID-19. People must opt into the system, but it has the potential to monitor about a third of the world’s population.

The technology, known as contact-tracing, is designed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus by telling users they should quarantine or isolate themselves after contact with an infected individual.

The Silicon Valley rivals said on Friday that they are building the technology into their iOS and Android operating systems in two steps. In mid-May, the companies will add the ability for iPhones and Android phones to wirelessly exchange anonymous information via apps run by public health authorities. The companies will also release frameworks for public health apps to manage functionality.

This means that if a user tests positive for COVID-19, and adds that data to their public health app, users who they came into close proximity with over the previous several days will be notified of their contact. This period could be 14 days, but health agencies can set the time range.

The second step takes longer. In the coming months, both companies will add the technology directly into their operating systems so this contact-tracing software works without having to download an app. Users must opt-in, but this approach means many more people can be included. Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android have about 3 billion users between them, over a third of the world’s population.

The pandemic has killed more than 100,000 and infected 1.63 million people. Governments have ordered millions to stay home, sending the global economy into a vicious tailspin. The pressure is building to relax these measures and get the world back to work. Contact-tracing is a key part of this because it can help authorities contain a potential resurgence of the virus as people resume regular activities.

Still, this technology is controversial because it involves sharing sensitive health information from billions of people via mobile devices that are constantly broadcasting their location. Some politicians and regulators have been warning that citizens’ privacy should be protected.

“We caution that actions taken to contain the spreading of coronavirus must also preserve the right to privacy held by each and every American,” members of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives, wrote in a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump. “Google’s colossal stores of data on daily movements of Americans, coupled with the might of local, state, and federal governments is an alarming prospect.”

Apple and Google stressed on Friday that their system preserves users’ privacy. Consent is required and location data is not collected. The technology also won’t notify users who they came into contact with, or where that happened. The companies said they can’t see this data either, and noted that the whole system can be shut down when needed.

Such a close partnership between these longtime rivals is extremely rare. The technology giants have competed in smartphone operating systems, app stores, media services, and voice-recognition technology for years -- while trading barbs over the privacy of each others’ platforms. However, both companies have been under pressure to use their prodigious resources to help fight the pandemic.

“All of us at Apple and Google believe there has never been a more important moment to work together to solve one of the world’s most pressing problems,” the companies said in a joint statement.

Their system uses Bluetooth, a standard way for most mobile devices to communicate with each other. Apple and Google shared a theoretical example to explain how it works.

Two people meet to chat for a few minutes, and in the background, via Bluetooth, their smartphones exchange anonymous identifiers to register that they have been in contact. These digital keys change every 15 minutes or so and remain on these people’s devices to preserve privacy.

Several days later, one of these individuals is diagnosed with COVID-19. The person enters the results into a health-agency app on their phone. The system then asks for this user’s consent. If granted, the person’s smartphone sends a record of the other mobile devices that have been in close proximity during the previous days. This information is temporarily stored in a remote computer server for about 14 days.

Meanwhile, the other person’s phone checks the server periodically to see if any identifier keys have been associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. The phone downloads all positive keys and matches it anonymously to the key belonging to the individual from the original meeting days earlier. This sends a notification to the other person’s phone with information from health agencies about how to quarantine or self-isolate.

The contact-tracing technology isn’t the first step against COVID-19 for either company. Google launched an information website in March, while Apple has released its own screening tools for iPhone users. Apple has also donated over 20 million masks to health-care workers and has designed face shields, and Verily, a unit of Google parent [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US), is running virus-testing sites in some parts of California.

Other organizations are also working on contact-tracing. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology earlier this week [announced](http://news.mit.edu/2020/bluetooth-covid-19-contact-tracing-0409) plans for a similar system. Some countries and third-party developers have also tried implementing contact-tracing on phones, but they have faced privacy and connectivity issues that the new system is designed to avoid.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,377754,public,confidence,self,"Apple, Google Bring COVID-19 Contact-Tracing to 3 Billion People",0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fylnwm/apple_google_bring_covid19_contacttracing_to_3/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our initial optimism that it would send us into a mild recession was proven wrong by our government’s inept response – the extra time that we were given was wasted. South Korea and the US had their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day. South Korea completely contained the virus through extensive testing and selective quarantining, while we failed to get the job done.

&amp;#x200B;

One factor that has worked to our disadvantage (one that is obvious in hindsight, as always, but I didn’t see it a few weeks ago) is that we here in the US are too “fat and happy.” The US is a democracy that has never fought a war on its own territory with another nation (9/11 is as close as we’ve come). We are separated from the rest of the world by an ocean on either side and two friendly neighbors on our north and south. We have simply been spoiled by prosperity. Bad things only had happened to other countries, not us. And this is how we looked at the virus when it exploded in China.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a democracy that values personal liberty has a lot of advantages, but expediency is not one of them. Today we are at war with a foreign entity and it is not a country but a tiny virus.

I don't mean this as a knock on anybody, but it's clear that a lot of people watching stocks right now don't fully understand what drives price action and movement in equities markets.

First, I think that the concept of a ""rational"" market is actually pretty vague and you have to really define what you mean by rational. For the purpose of this discussion, rational means ""equities are priced at fair value relative to cash flow and forward growth prospects"" -- obviously that still leaves a lot of ambiguity but I think thats typically what people jump to when they think of a ""rational market"".

When you see such a shock to the system like we are currently having, consensus is shattered and markets go through a massive price discovery phase. As such, the main drivers of price action right now are liquidity, momentum, technicals, and full blown game theory. There are so many variables effecting things right now, and so much uncertainty within all those variables, it really wouldn't make any sense if markets were trying to price things based on some calculated projection, because those projections don't exist.

IMO the fact that the market just had its best week since the dawn of time in the face of all the uncertainty does not mean it's irrational it just means that there is uncertainty in both directions and theres a lot of active players trying to hash it out. The large swings are a result of high emotions of investors and when momentum starts to move it gains a ton of inertia. It will take months/years for the market to price in this event from a fundamental perspective (and I do believe that it will efficiently account for it over a long period of time). But in the short term I would actually argue that equities markets are actually moving pretty appropriately right now and that the high IV just comes with the territory.

If you are investing, be patient and remind yourself that during these massively volatile price discover phases, the market will retest levels as its part of rebuilding that market consensus. If you are trading, go hardAF, stay disciplined, and keep your risk management TIGHT.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm back testing Turtles strategy (trend trading) on a few future contracts on Excel.

&amp;#x200B;

The original turtles strategy has 2 systems with different parameters :

\- System 1: shorter term, 20-day breakout and 10-day EXIT

\- System 2 : long term, 55-day breakout and 20 day EXIT

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how R Dennis chose these two parameters but he certainly had his reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

So I used VBA to try to find out which parameters were the best, wanted to use loops for that : 

\- Breakout 20 to 120 ; and Exit 2 to number chose for breakout days

&amp;#x200B;

My criteria to find out best parameters is  total return.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, that takes a lot of times, I'll need like hours to test all the values.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just wanted to know if you had some advice, and if there are values I can eliminate and if so why? (like maybe Exit days &gt; than 30 , Break out days &gt; than 100 ...)

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you

while taking a piss I had the idea that the current market crash and ""recovery"" (if you could call it that) is the way it is due to a large amount of internet based economy.

The crash was so rought bc of:
 1. No one knew how rough Corona would hit. so once there was a small hit to the economy everyone and their mother startet panic selling. you could compare it to the irrational toilet paper buying. If others are doing it, I should do it too
 they must know something I don't!

2. it is super easy to sell your stocks. just log into your online banking account, or what ever you use and sell. very quick. similar to shopping on amazon. and it's just as easy to buy. so all the toilet paper horders might as well have stocks.

3.

This company is a fantastic COVID-19 play. I realize it got pumped and dumped on reddit and other social medias, but the reason for the hype is still there. I have seen many people destroying iBio by saying they didn\'t create an Ebola vaccine. Ebola didn\'t spread like COVID-19 did. Their fast pharming system would be unnecessary as scaling up for Ebola was unnecessary; they got sued because their stock price plummeted when Ebola turned out not to spread like everyone feared. iBio now has a new CEO, and are partnering with TAMUS, IDRI, and Chinese biotech company who has already developed a vaccine for a COVID cousin.\n\nI know there are a lot of other companies working on a vaccine for COVID-19. However, if you have been following COVID-19 you would know that in S. Korea people who have ""recovered"" from the virus have gotten reinfected. Yes, that\'s right, the virus itself (being in the system for at least 2 weeks, did not trigger the immune system to be able to produce enough antibodies to spot the virus before it does serious damage. So if the virus itself being in the system for 2 weeks doesn\'t give a good enough immunity to the virus, what makes any of believe mRNA that produces vaccine proteins or antigens of the virus will provide enough protection against this virus. Therefore, we will need multiple shots spaced over several months (think Hep A or B vaccinations) or have a vaccine that produces an incredibly potent immune response.\n\nHere is where iBio comes in. They have produced VLPs (vaccine like particles) that look exactly like the virus to the body. Furthermore, the VLPs express the antigens (e.g. spike protein that lets covid-19 enter cells) in a uniform and easily detectable pattern so our body produces the correct antibodies. The benefit of using VLPs is that they create a lasting immunity by activating our immune system in our bones (memory immune cells). Not only that, but iBio is working with IDRI to create an optimal adjuvant-antigen combination. An adjuvant enhances the bodies immune response to an antigen. So, not only do they have a superior product to combat this invisible enemy (invisible in that the immune system doesn\'t detect a reinfection even after you have had it per S. Korea) but they are working with top ID minds on Novel and patented adjuvant technology.\n\n"" “We are excited to be a partner in the development of IBIO-200,” said Corey Casper, M.D., MPH, Chief Executive Officer of the IDRI and Clinical Professor of Medicine and Global Health at the University of Washington. “Combining iBio’s VLP antigen with an IDRI adjuvant provides for promising safety and efficacy characteristics, and importantly, the ready ability to scale-up manufacturing to help meet the projected global demand for a suitable vaccine.”\n\nThe lead in the race for a vaccine is J and J. They are NOT making an mRNA vaccine, which means it\'s going to be antigen or protein based; iBio grows proteins incredibly fast and at a huge scale using plants; this means they will rely on BARDA to scale up the vaccine (which is what iBio\'s fast pharming facility was literally created by the US government to do). So, even if Johnson and Johnson beat iBio to the punch, iBio will produce the vaccine for johnson and johnson as part of the Blue Angle initiative their facility was created for. iBio is THE COVID-19 play. The stock will rise because J and J are in the lead and it seems a simple immune response isn\'t going to be effective enough to prevent reinfection. iBio has some of the top minds working on an incredibly safe, effective and scaleable vaccine.

## U.S. market history points to a final bottom in August

Is the great coronavirus bear market of 2020 now history? Many exuberant bulls would have you believe that it is, since the S&amp;P 500 [**SPX,** **+1.44%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) is now more than 20% higher than its mid-March low. That satisfies the semi-official definition of a bull market.

So in that narrow sense, the bulls are right. But in a broader sense, I consider their arguments to be a triumph of hope over experience. If by definition we’re in a new bull market, the question we should be asking is different: Will the stock market hit a new low later this year, lower than where it stood at the March low?

I’m convinced the answer is “yes.” My study of past bear markets revealed a number of themes, each of which points to the [March low being broken in coming weeks or months](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-big-of-a-bear-market-rally-in-stocks-you-can-expect-according-to-nine-decades-of-history-2020-04-01?mod=article_inline).

While the market’s rally since its March 23 low has been explosive, it’s not unprecedented. Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **+1.22%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) was created in the late 1800s, there have been 38 other occasions where it rallied just as much (or more) in just as short a period — and all of them occurred during the Great Depression.

Such ominous parallels are a powerful reminder that the market can explode upward during the context of a devastating long-term decline. Consider the bull- and bear-market calendar maintained by Ned Davis Research. According to it, there were no fewer than six bull markets between the 1929 stock market crash and the end of the 1930s. I doubt an investor interviewed in 1939 about his experience of the Great Depression would have highlighted those bull markets.

Another way of making the same point is to measure the number of days between the end of the bear market’s first leg down and its eventual end. There are 11 bear markets in the Ned Davis calendar in which the Dow fell by more than the 37.1% loss it incurred between its February 2020 high to its March low. On average across those 11, as you can see from the chart below, the final bear market low came 137 days after first registering such a loss. If we add that average to the day of the March low, we come up with a projected low on Aug. 7.

Demetri Kofinas speaks with Tom Derry, CEO of the Institute for Supply Management and publisher of the market-moving ISM Manufacturing Index about the impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains. This is a deep-dive into how the intricate world of just-in-time manufacturing, outsourcing, and globalization has been impacted by the world-wide disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus.  

In recent years, global supply chains have been in the process of a fundamental shift, in part to strengthen their immune systems to mitigate the risk of multiple threats — unprecedented trade turbulence, as well as economic uncertainty, geopolitical events, and rising labor costs. COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) has provided a severe new test to these global supply chains. Since its genesis in the manufacturing hub of Wuhan, China, in December, the outbreak has resulted in more than one million documented cases and nearly sixty thousand deaths worldwide, quarantined workers, temporarily shuttered factories, canceled high-profile events, shaken markets, and handcuffed supply management organizations at many companies. The gravity of the situation was exemplified in a survey by the Institute for Supply Management, which found that nearly three-fourths (72%) of U.S. companies have experienced supply chain disruptions due to coronavirus-related transportation restrictions, and 81% of organizations expect their procurement operations to be impacted by COVID-19. For some of those companies, the infection goes beyond the supply chain, as 16% of survey respondents report lowering annual revenue targets by an average of 5.6%. More than half (53%) of the 628 respondents in ISM’s recent survey said their companies are having trouble getting supply chain information from China.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,376635,public,confidence,self,What is the impact of COVID-19 on Global Supply Chains?

Who would pay so much for a piece of art?

At the time, it was unclear who the mystery buyer was.

There was speculation it could be Jeff Bezos, maybe hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, was it a Chinese Billionaire?

Well, no...

It turns out it was [one of the Saudis](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/salvator-mundi-da-vinci-saudi-prince-bader.html).

Specifically, a relatively little-known member of the Saudi royal family, Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, the Minister of Culture of Saudi Arabia.

He is also a close friend of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

In fact, the artwork has [reportedly been installed on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's superyacht](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/10/da-vinci-salvator-mundi-saudi-prince-yacht), which is worth around half a billion dollars itself. Quite the flex...

**According to a joint report by UBS and art fair organizer Art Basel, global sales of art and antiques reached an estimated $64.1 billion in 2019.**

The US, UK and China accounted for 82% of the value of global sales in 2019.

The US was the largest market worldwide, accounting for 44% of global sales by value.

In second place, the UK accounted for 20% of the global sales by value.

China accounted for 18% of the global sales by value.

Clearly, there is a lot of money flying about in the art world.

But this discussion isn't about Saudi trillionaires and their billionaire friends paying half a B for a painting, this is about cleaning dirty laundry...

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MONEY LAUNDERING ADVICE. ALWAYS CONSULT A TOP NOTCH TEAM OF LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTING EXPERTS WHEN LOOKING TO LAUNDER MONEY PROFESSIONALLY.**

Let's begin...

Step 1: John Doe is an art dealer. He persuades his friends Alice and Bob to buy works by an up and coming young artist, for $2million each, on the understanding that they will be a good investment.

Step 2: Over the next few years, John Doe uses his position to hype the artist. He hires people to write about the artist in academic journals, organises exhibitions, helps the artist to 'win' prizes, etc.

Step 3: John Doe puts some of the artist's works into auctions, and bids the prices up with the help of friends. As he is ultimately buying from himself, the only cost is the auctioneer's commission.

Step 4: Ten years later, Alice and Bob own works that are worth, on paper at least, $10MM.

Step 5: In the meantime, Alice has just pulled off the real estate deal of a lifetime, and made a huge profit. Unfortunately, she now owes the IRS $10MM.

Step 6: She decides to donate the painting to her local modern art museum. The trustees are happy to state it's value at $10MM. The IRS accepts the valuation and allows Alice to write of her $10 million tax bill. She is now a noted philanthropist, and she gets a wing of the museum named after her.

Step 7: Bob, on the other hand, isn't doing so well. He needs cash quick, but he can't sell his painting on the open market - because it isn't worth very much without John Doe manipulating the price.

Step 8: Bob goes to his bank and asks for a loan, using the painting as collateral. However, the bank wants an independent assessment of its value, so they ask a world expert on this particular artist - John Doe. John Doe confirms that, based on previous auction prices, it's worth $10 million.

Step 9: The bank agrees to lend Bob 70% of the value - $7 million.

Step 10: So Alice has saved herself $10 million in taxes from an initial outlay of $2 million. And Bob has got himself $7 million to play with from an initial outlay of $2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

**At the end of the day,**

**Art is like fiat currency.**

**Paint a bunch of pieces of paper green and claim they're worth as much as a house, or a mansion, or even a super-yacht.**

Which is fine. He says there's no point in investing in smaller ETF's as I have recently done because the companies that make up these ETF's are already included in an index like VOO, albeit in a smaller percentage. He also doesn't agree the risk is worthwhile investing in recently-hit travel related companies which I believe to be on sale. For reference, my recent portfolio is

VOO -25%
Amazon - 18%
CCL - 5%
RCL - 5%

RTH - 2%

VOX - 3.5%

I've actually though about selling most of those smaller ETF's and using the cahs instead to buy shares of solid companies like Apple, Disney, Microsoft, etc.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday’s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank’s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street’s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday’s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.

*****

&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It’s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.

*****

&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won’t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on “Squawk Box,” the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world’s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That’s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state’s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday’s news conference the outbreak could “stabilize” within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.

*****

&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That’s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.

By Krishnadevan Vijayaraghavan

A chief investment officer of a large public sector bank-sponsored mutual fund signed off the fund's April letter to investors stating, ""A golden period of science as well as spirituality is ahead of us!""

COVID-19 Could Well Find Its Place In The Curriculum Of Business Schools As The Pivotal Event That Reshaped Thinking On Capital Allocation.

This is interesting, especially because fund managers usually are loath to soothsaying. The letter appears, in some parts, to state the obvious, and in others, making oblique references to what may be in store.

Investment managers are hired for their ability to predict earnings growth and emerging economic trends. Yes, economic trends get shaped by advances in science and technology.

How can one know that advances in science are on the anvil?  That would mean higher allocation to basic research. That would mean someone writing out a cheque to research on any thing that may not be useful immediately.

Does it mean that investment decisions will not be driven by capital efficiency? Will it mean that capital allocators will worry more about building resilience than over return on investment?

That will require investors and analysts to spare companies from the tyranny of being assessed on a quarterly basis. 

Companies can then stay focussed on finding the next penicillin, creating a driverless car or finding a cure for diabetes.

Will companies pay a premium for reliability of a supply chain over just-in-time availability of raw material?

Hero MotoCorp has already said it is looking at 'flexipoint' sourcing. That's a departure from the vendor consolidation strategy followed by most companies to improve capital efficiency.

Will investors take a benign view of such changes and offer a premium for such practices?

COVID-19 could well find its place in the curriculum of business schools as the pivotal event that reshaped thinking on capital allocation.

The corollary to this is investors may have to recalibrate expectations of return. The days of superlative returns may be over, for now. The quest for outsized returns, or market outperformers, had significantly altered the manner in which sell-side, or brokerage, analysts operated.

Moderated expectation of returns will also end the hunt for alpha-return-generating managers, which implies a fall in fund management fees too.

Fund management fees are falling across the world.

This could result in wider usage of technology by the fund industry, especially in portfolio management. One may start seeing more robo investing in the future, where fund manager's discretion or bias will not be allowed to override built-in bells and whistles in a portfolio. 

Such developments will pave the way for waning of the current fancy for owning asset managing companies as fees get linked to performance, not as a percentage of assets under management.

It will also require that investors pay no heed to the size of a new fund offering and rankings, or to tags such as fastest growing asset management company.

If structural changes are in the offing, then suggestions it is time to buy stocks because the earning yield of the benchmark indices and 10-year government bond yields are at 2007-08 crisis levels do not make sense.

If structural changes are set to happen, the place to look for them might not be in the vestiges of the existing structure.

How about telling investors that existing tenets could get challenged?

For instance, tell them the benchmark Nifty 50 index could struggle under the weight of the financial services sector, as it has a 42% weightage, and is set to see its worst loan book since the global financial crisis of 2007-08.

Sometimes it is just better to state upfront that there is no view for the moment.

And, that for now, the way ahead will be by feeling for stepping stones.

Cataclysmic events often lead to calls for changes in existing practices, but these moments of righteous indignation could fizzle out when one is past the crisis.

The time to think of changes is now, when the hatchets have been downed and everybody is waiting for the storm to pass. This is the time to debate, discuss and draft the way ahead.

As for the CIO’s view that the golden period of spirituality is ahead of us, it is a fine thought to nurture.  A caveat though, it does not take much for the halo to slip and turn into a noose.  End

&amp;#x200B;

Here's Buffett's advice for a stock market crash.

&amp;#x200B;

## 1. Don't try to time the bottom

While Buffett may be nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha, he's always been quick to admit that timing the market is a fool's errand, even for himself.

""I make no attempt to forecast the market -- my efforts are devoted to finding undervalued securities,"" the **Berkshire Hathaway** ([NYSE:BRK.A](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/berkshire-hathaway-a-shares/brk.a/)) ([NYSE:BRK.B](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/berkshire-hathaway-b-shares/brk.b/)) chairman and CEO has said.

Buffett has taken this stance even further, implying in Berkshire's 1992 shareholder letter that near-term market forecasts can be ""poison"" for investors. 

Instead of focusing his energy on timing the market, Buffett devotes his efforts to finding great businesses at good prices. ""If we think a business is attractive, it would be very foolish for us to not take action on that because we thought something about what the market was going to do,"" Buffet said during the company's 1994 shareholder meeting.""If you're right about the businesses, you'll end up doing fine."" 

It's Buffett's skill at finding undervalued high-quality businesses that has earned him the nickname Oracle of Omaha -- not his ability to time the market. Further, his decision to *avoid* timing the market has likely aided his stock-picking prowess.

## 2. Don't waste a good buying opportunity

One of the biggest problems with investors making market timing a key part of their investment strategy is that it can result in missing out on opportunities to buy stocks at lower prices while they are busy trying to predict a bottom of a market sell-off. Since predicting the bottom of a downturn is so difficult (if not impossible) the best way for investors to take advantage of these opportunities is to simply be a net buyer of stocks over time, particularly when stocks of quality companies go down in price.

After Googling it does seem that I'm not the first person to come up with this idea, so bare with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently invested into some blue chip stocks. After watching the market for a few days I noticed that when the market opened for trade the price of my stock would significantly change within the first half hour.

The profit from my plan comes from the small spikes that can happen when the market opens. If I hold a stock, if I sell it when this spike happens then wait for the price to drop after that spike the the difference between these point would be the profit. Assuming I don't re-buy the stock for more than I sold it for.

Essentially just buy a blue chip stock, wait for it to go up in price when the market opens (if it does that day), sell it, wait for the evening, buy the stock again (if it is lower than what I sold it for) then resell it in the morning if it increases in price. If it doesn't then worse case scenario I end up with a stock like Apple or Microsoft that I wouldn't mind holding onto anyway.

 I calculated that if we did this from the 2nd of January until now with a single stock in Microsoft it would have made a profit of $13.20 (I did this because I wanted to see the effects of a recession) Therefore this would be magnified when the market starts to come out of recession. 

To my understanding, if I don't re-buy them for more than I sold them for then that small increment that rose above the price I re-buy them for is profit.

# Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it’s more diversified

While online-ad rivals like Facebook and Twitter were still startups with no revenue to speak of in the last recession, former Google CEO says search giant learned some lessons

*This article is part of a series tracking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on major businesses and will be updated. It was originally published on April 8.*

Alphabet Inc.’s Google lords over the online-advertising market, which is both a blessing and a curse in the age of coronavirus.

The core business of Alphabet **GOOGL,** **+2.06%** **GOOG,** **+2.00%** commands roughly 30% of the $110 billion digital-advertising markets worldwide and is expected to maintain that lead in 2021 and beyond, according to eMarketer. YouTube is a big reason why, as it is expected to haul in $9.33 billion in 2020 and $11.4 billion in 2021, according to eMarketer. In February, Alphabet disclosed it brought in $15.1 billion in ads through YouTube in 2019, and $8.9 billion via Google Cloud.

If there is one company that will initially be hit hardest by ad cutbacks, it’s Google. Up to 40% of its revenue comes from categories hard hit by COVID-19: in-person retail, restaurants, travel, automotive and small businesses. But it is also likely to be the first to rebound because of its market leadership.

**Business in the age of COVID-19:** **Read profiles of how other large companies will be affected by the coronavirus**

Google has been here before when it wasn’t named Alphabet. During the recession sparked by the subprime-loan crisis a decade ago, sales remained at single-digit growth for five quarters in a row. Google’s revenue estimates declined at least 15% in 2009 and 2010, with a marginally greater earnings hit, according to an analysis by MKM Partners.

Then again, Google had the field all to itself more than a decade ago, before Facebook Inc. **FB,** **+3.22%**, Snap Inc. **SNAP,** **+9.25%**, and Twitter Inc. **TWTR,** **+8.78%** emerged as online ad rivals.

“Back then, I was told at the time the recovery is quicker than you think it is when you get there, and the strongest companies recover quicker than the weaker ones,” former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a Zoom **ZM,** **+3.56%** conference with business executives, investors and media on April 7.

Analysts seem to agree, painting a picture of short-term pain but a quick recovery for Google.

“We are modelling a \[year-over-year\] decline in Google revenues in Q2 followed by continued acceleration in revenues \[in the second half\],” MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an April 3 note. “However, we do not expect Google to return to double-digit revenue growth until Q1 ’21.”

“To put this delicately, use the opportunity of the crisis to reconfigure and ensure the decisions you make now make you stronger when this lifts — a year or maybe less,” Schmidt said.

In 2008, for example, Google repriced stock options to employees to stabilize its workforce and retain talent.

“It was the right decision at the time,” Schmidt said.

Since the last recession, Google has also acted to diversify its business beyond search ads, with YouTube and Cloud accounting for more than 40% of incremental growth, MKM Partners reported.

Alphabet reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 22.

How the numbers are changing

**Revenue:** Average analyst expectations for the first quarter were $43.17 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $42.08 billion as of April 6. Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet’s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.

**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.

**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.

What the company is saying

Not much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven’t said anything of note — either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts — about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.

**April 3:** “Our priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,” John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.

In a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day — 25 times the traffic of a typical day.

**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division. During its fiscal fourth quarter, it said YouTube was at $15 billion in annual ad revenue, and Cloud is on a $10 billion revenue run rate.

• Online advertising is half of the global advertising, and Google has roughly 40% market share of online advertising. The math points toward an inevitable short-term disadvantage to Google, but a speedy recovery because of its clout, according to MKM Partners. “We expect Google advertising revenues to decelerate from ‘high teens’ (18% to 20%) during 2019 to 4% in 1Q:20, -1% in 2Q:20, and approx. +4% in 4Q20. We are raising our Google Cloud revenue assumptions as we expect a continued acceleration in the cloud, driven by sales force expansion and healthier end markets.” — **MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni**, maintained his buy rating while trimming Alphabet’s price target to $1,400 from $1,600 on April 3.

• “We expect Google to have a greater near-term disadvantage but also have a faster recovery as pandemic effects reduce... We believe Alphabet will be more resilient vs. Facebook in weathering the advertising decline due to its lower exposure to the \[small business\] advertiser base. As a result of these top-line changes, our 2020 GAAP EPS estimate is now $40.56 (vs. prior estimate of $53.47) and our 2021 GAAP EPS is now $54.30 (vs. a prior estimate of $66.” — **Citi analyst Jason Bazinet**, maintained a buy rating while trimming Alphabet’s price target to $1,400 from $1,700 on April 1",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,375722,public,confidence,self,"Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it’s more diversified",0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fxfnf4/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been looking into the volatile world of options and have a mechanics question. I feel I understand the basic concepts but, being new, I have some concerns about my vocabulary, making me feel a bit insecure.

Here's what I think I know:

If I buy a put or call, I ""buy to open"", as in I open a position. I believe this allows me to exercise or sell the option before the expiration date.

If I decide to sell the options without exercising them, I ""sell to close"", meaning I sell and close my position. I believe this means I no longer have rights to exercise the option, nor any requirement to buy or sell any sort of securities because of it. Basically, I've made or lost (probably lost) some money and my work there is done.

I'm not ready to jump in with real money yet. I just want to make sure that I have a solid foundation and, if I do decide to buy some options, that I don't end up inadvertently opening myself up to a bunch of additional liability beyond the cost of the option itself.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,375504,public,confidence,self,Help with stock options basics?,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fxcryt/help_with_stock_options_basics/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,1586373606.0,,,,

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Gap Downs: BABA, BIDU, GSX, IQ,  TAL, W

Looks like the market is setting up for an inside day, Very few gappers and almost no stocks with catalyst which doesn't give us good odds. I am not a fan of the watch list today. I mentioned yesterday that the 272 pivot should act as resistance and it did, we saw a sell off at that level. Now the SPY is sitting in between the 272 pivot and the weekly 200 sma. Ideally we would like to see some basing action for a few days before a break higher over the 272 pivot, will we get that, will the market drop more or continue?

I would like to bet against the market by buying a put. I've done lots of research, but I'm not sure I understand it. I'll say what I do understand, and hopefully someone can help me out. 

So let's say hypothetical stock ABC is trading today for $100. I believe that sometime in the next 30 days the stock will be trading at $80. 

Let's also assume that I don't own any stock of ABC. 

If I buy an option to sell ABC for $90 in 30 days, and I pay $5.00 for that option, and the stock goes down to $80, I know I have made money, but exactly how? Since I don't own the stock itself, would I have to buy it at the $80.00 and then sell it at the $90.00 simultaneously for the profit? 

Or perhaps I could sell the option itself and make money before the expiration? 

The thing is that the options I want to trade I don't have the capital for to afford 100 shares to buy and resell even if I know I'll make money on the trade.

The original thread can be found here:

**Disclaimer**:  *This is based on historical precedence and we are in unprecedented times but, with history as our guide a strong argument can be made for the S&amp;P to decline to a level that is currently inconceivable.*

# Are we in a recession?

If you believe so, or that we are heading into a recession then there are four things needed to support a genuine rally out of a recession

&amp;#x200B;

* Fiscal policy
* Monetary policy
* Improving economic health indicators
* Accurate pricing reflecting the end of the recession and tempered optimism

We are missing 2 out of those 4 criteria; the overwhelming monetary and fiscal policy (world-records) are compensating for lack of positive *indicators* and *volatile and bullish* *pricing*.

# What do you mean by pricing?

It can be argued that the current price of stocks is not discounting for the acute and likely chronic harm to consumer sentiment and spending power.  For example; the UK clothing retailer Next Group closed their bricks and mortar stores (share price increased 4%) then they cancelled all online shopping (share price increased 3%) and finally they cancelled all orders with their supply chain (shares leapt 12.8% during the rally.)  There is the massive amount of second, third and fourth order effects that this one company does to the UK economy (and Turkish factories).  Suppliers, shipping, design, marketing etc all cancelled and the staff furloughed.

This is one example but the indexes are currently full of similar examples and some analysts are ringing the alarm bells.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lazard Asset Management are concerned that the pandemic “will persist longer than many investors suspect and that the economic damage will be deeper and potentially longer-lasting”.

Reddit is quick to mention that *stonks* only go up but there is some truth to that sentiment at present since *any negative factors* are dismissed as being priced in and all positive factors are heralded as a cause for stocks to rally.  If priced in was accurate then we would not see record-beating market rallies back to back.  10% volatility swings over 48 hours is the very definition of *not priced in.* 

There is evidence to suggest that, well, the bullish sentiment is wrong and mainly because it is [retail investors being taken for a ride](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-stock-market-investors-buy-the-dip-80ae288d-619b-487a-acbd-8409c05db52d.html) whilst funds re-balance and offload. 

Retail traders ""buying the dips"" is normally a contrarian signal, meaning that it's time to sell. 

&amp;#x200B;

# What does this have to do with the trailing 10 year dividend?

&amp;#x200B;

Major indexes are comprised of stocks that [pay handsome dividends](https://www.dividendinvestor.com/the-sp-500-dividend-yield-a-historical-analysis/); normally 2% yield a year. The companies have reached their limit of growth (HSBC haven't discovered 5 million new customers and Shell are not finding new fossil fuels) so investors hold the stock for **income-seeking reasons**.  

The FTSE 100 was priced in to generate £89 billion in dividends for 2019 and £90 billion+ in 2020.  That has largely collapsed.  

The only companies that pay dividends are those taking on debt to do so like Shell.  And they have; [a 10Bn credit line to maintain dividends](https://www.ft.com/content/ee832198-024b-4a0f-a61d-de767a1e6d6c).  The Bank of England[had to slap 5 UK banks](https://www.ft.com/content/c13d3d21-b6f3-4449-a916-2ba4271818e4) from issuing dividends at this time.  That means that their primary valuations as income-generating stocks are questionable...

...especially since the dividends are not expected to return to the 2020 levels for another 10 years now.

# 

# Onto the S&amp;P

In 2021 the market expects the dividends per share for the S&amp;P to be reduced to $38 per share.  That is priced in and common knowledge.

That is a 41% drop from the recent highs of $63 a share and seems alarming for income seeking investors since we are not expected to recover to those prices for 8-10 years.

But DataTrek have noted that **we are still currently trading at 21X** the trailing 10 year earnings of $122 a share.

Dividends per share normally don't fall as far as earnings per share.  But they are inverted at present. 

For the S&amp;P to be trading at 2,650 level (or even higher) it means the market does not believe the pandemic or recession will have any long-term damage.  That puts us squarely at odds with items 3 and 4 in our list of factors needed to exit a bear market.

In other recessions, including 2008, the S&amp;P traditionally pulled back to 10X a share for trailing 10 year average.  That would mean *halving* the current value of the S&amp;P.

In actual fact, during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bear market; the dividends per share dropped by a lower percentage amount than the ***total index value drop***.  The market drop was approximately 1.5X what the dividend per share drop was.

Right now, we have the reverse.  Dividend share drop is 41% and market drop was approximately 30% and rallying heavily back to 18% only.  That makes no financial sense unless the assets were being propped by buyers...

If the S&amp;P truly does pull back to the equilibrium price of 10X, as has happened in previous recessions, then we would expect to see levels of around $1200 at the bottom but that seems extremely bearish.

If previous indications hold true, then we would expect the S&amp;P to drop by approximately 50-60%ish at the true bottom to reflect the 41% decrease in expected shares plus additional discounts and negative market sentiment.

In reality, we are probably likely to pull back to between 13X and 15X trailing average which puts the S&amp;P between 1600 and 1800.

&amp;#x200B;

# TL:DR

&amp;#x200B;

* 2 out of the 4 necessities for exiting a recession are not present
* S&amp;P currently trading at 21X the trailing 10 year average dividend
* In previous recessions the index pulls back to 10X the average trailing dividend
* In previous recessions the dividend per share drop is *less* than the overall index drop
* At present the S&amp;P dividend per share drop is 41% but the S&amp;P is rallying back to less than 20% drop...whilst dividends are not expected to return to 2019 levels of income for 8-10 years
* S&amp;P highly overvalued, completely inverted when compared with dividend expectation and market dividend pricing
* S&amp;P pull back to 1600-1800 over short-medium time frame (1 month-6 months). 
* If market history is to be believed then 1200 is not unfeasible based on percentages
* If S&amp;P continues to rise then it indicates companies are taking on debt or other instruments to pay dividends rather than innovate, upgrade or consolidate their business position.

# Why is bullish sentiment so wrong? 

The negative reports are so wildly negative that the almost defy belief.  We are dealing with insane numbers way beyond our traditional frame of reasoning. This is topped only by the insanity of the scale of quantitative easing.  Less than a year ago, a small movement in the non-farm payrolls would lead to a 2-3% move in the markets; now we are hitting 700K jobs lost, a truly ugly number and the market rallies hugely. Future economic students will study this to try and understand what was happening. 

In the space of *weeks* the majority of the Western economies have swung to being effectively state-sponsored, centralised economies and no one really knows how to unwind these positions.  

It is impossible to reconcile being a bull with a centralised state economy and blue-chip stocks that refuse to pay dividends but the share price remains at the same levels as when they paid a 2% yield.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,374341,public,confidence,self,S&amp;P 1700 within 6 Months,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fwvt54/sp_1700_within_6_months/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'OKOFBKwWqgwNfC-PsTx0SxYPfY563DoAVR7zTPZLijI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/sDjCHPIgVRy7Cl6d1K8ev72-wq1crs8MDGmRV6tqJto.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9629020b25b25ecc9e5057609262681858b57295', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/sDjCHPIgVRy7Cl6d1K8ev72-wq1crs8MDGmRV6tqJto.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32547d6682b7386c218c4c937cca0193b73926e3', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/sDjCHPIgVRy7Cl6d1K8ev72-wq1crs8MDGmRV6tqJto.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4f89cf6175a9118e09f4caa2646f4b8c02bf1f8', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/sDjCHPIgVRy7Cl6d1K8ev72-wq1crs8MDGmRV6tqJto.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca91faca52b49fdfda1e80202cffac9ecffc831e', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/sDjCHPIgVRy7Cl6d1K8ev72-wq1crs8MDGmRV6tqJto.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88098dd6305c40f98e8d107101dd80fdcd883473', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/sDjCHPIgVRy7Cl6d1K8ev72-wq1crs8MDGmRV6tqJto.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8761a132a597dd5fb4854e9f806e4747bbe10abc', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1080, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/sDjCHPIgVRy7Cl6d1K8ev72-wq1crs8MDGmRV6tqJto.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a31de1dc39bbc1887c494a9d7b235b099304402a', 'width': 1920}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

Decision Making Process- Investing
	Life is a process, just like investing is
	Every process has inputs and outputs, the more you put in a process the better the outcomes.
	Some inputs into the process to start investing are:
	Action, Save money and taking risks
	The quicker you take action, the quicker you start investing and the sooner you start making money in the market
	The more you save, the more you invest and more returns you get in the long term
	The less you are afraid to start investing, the easier the process of investing becomes.
	The younger you are, the more inputs you need to have.
	The goal of investing is achieving financial freedom for your family and next generation.
2.	Steps to Start Investing in the Stock Market
	Save money 
	Make budget and start saving from your paycheck

	Have reasons why you want to start investing

	The best reason to start investing is to change your role in life. Living pay check to paycheck means you are always renting from the owners of wealth. Investing in stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets means you’re an owner rather than a debtor. Its only through being an owner of assets that you will be able to achieve the financial freedom that many take for granted.

	Have a financial plan drawn and approved by you.

	Number one reason investors lose money is because they start investing without a plan. Know your financial goals?

	Know your risk tolerance
	Include the risk tolerance in your initial plan so you know how much risk you willing to take with your investments. You can either choose to be a moderate investor or aggressive one. More risks, higher probability in making more money.

	Open you investment account
	Check with E*trade and TDAmeritrade. I personally use these two.

	Link your bank account with investment account (Optional)
	This gives you an advantage to always have money in your investment account, because normal transfer from bank to investment account can take 2-3 days. That’s when you might lose an opportunity to buy a stock or share that is a big deal now.

	Understand the graph chart before buying your first stock/share
	Previous close, last price yesterday when the market closed
	Open, today’s starting price soon when the market opens, usually 9:30a.m 
	The Bid is how much someone if offering for a stock. 
	Ask price is the price at which someone is offering to sell their stock.
	The beta is the general riskiness of the stock compared to the overall market
	The 52-week range is the highest and lowest price at which the stock has traded over the last year
	Volume is the amount of shares that are trading so far that day and the average amount of shares traded each day over the last three months. If they are not many people buying and selling the stock, the bid and ask price may be far apart.
	Market capitalization is the total worth of shares issued by the company
	P/E or price to earnings ratio is the stock price divided by how much in net income per share the company has booked over the last year
	The dividend and yield are important point for many investors. Stocks that pay dividends usually pay them out in four installments throughout the year. The Yield is the percentage of the dividend divided by the stock price, a return you will get just for the regular cash payments. Dividend paying stocks, you get paid for holding them. 
	Give yourself time and understand the graph

	Buy your first stock, build you portfolio and diversify.
	Ensure your portfolio is diversified. Simply means DO not put all the eggs in one Basket.

3.	Steps to publicly trade your company in the Stock Market
	Hire an Investment banker
	Structure a Deal

Hi guys, with the market rallying 20% from its ""bottom"", many people are expressing the sentiment that we should buy back into the market again because the ""fed"" or the ""government"" won't allow stocks to crash. 

We will for sure see unprecedented actions taken by the fed and the government because they have both the motive and the political capital to enact such policies. However, I think this is a misguided reason to believe the market is currently making its ""real"" rally.

I am not not a permabear nor am I a permabull. I just try to objectively analyze the facts, apply a healthy dose of margin of safety, and then see if my conclusions are actionable.

For example, I posted my thesis on why we will enter a serious global economic downturn on Feb 9th 10 days before it happened. At the time we were at the height of the biggest bull market in our history, and I had gotten a lot of attacks on my thesis leading up to me consolidating my thoughts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/

I continued adding more thoughts on things like the potential efficacy of Chloroquine 2 weeks before Trump announced it in a press conference and the media picked up on it, the potential collapse of American oil producers before the price war happened, casinos going under, helicopter money, bailouts, etc all before they were announced or the markets priced them in here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fede69/continued_thoughts_on_the_global_economic_impact/

And finally I talked about an upcoming inflection point coincidentally moments before Trump first announced Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine and 2 trading days before the ""bottom"" of the market:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fleh7e/incoming_inflection_point_for_general_market/

So I'm perfectly happy to make bearish calls or bullish calls, they are dependent variables of independent and unbiased analysis. I hope I made a reasonable case for why I am not personally biased (although, for the sake of humanity, I do wish for progress and prosperity of course).

I think the market rally is largely a mirage, and we are not getting correct pricings. The rally is probably driven by two main sources:

- Capital displacement from monetary action

- Incorrect earnings modeling based on improper historic precedent.

So the capital displacement is relatively simple: If you're seeking shelter in ""risk free"" investments that has some yields, you're now competing with a buyer (federal reserve) that prints hundreds of billions up to whatever it wants. They're literally squeezing out capital from the finite treasuries.

If you want riskier high quality corporate bonds, the fed will be there.

If you want even equities, you're going to face competition for them in the future. At least that's what former chairwoman Jenet Yellen recently said about the possibility of expanding their powers to buy equities.

So money is getting squeezed into a smaller and smaller relative portion of the financial markets, and the artificial demand is driving yields down and prices up. I could write a whole thread about this, but let's stick with the explanation of price movement.

The second main reason for the recent rally is from institutional investors who are incorrectly modeling earnings/yield of equities. So the logic here is: trillions are injected into the economy (fiscal injections), those trillions will become earnings for companies at some multiplier of the original stimulus over x amount of time, and if we add this number to the unstimulated estimated earnings, we can model future earnings.

My issue with this model, is on two main assumptions:

The first assumption is the length of disruption caused by the threat of this virus.

This virus is not going to stop its serious disruption of behavior from economic actors. Especially not in a country like the US where the majority of people have a massive financial disincentive to seek out healthcare. Here's my logic:

For months I've been praising the governments and response of South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. With Taiwan being the absolute best at handling the virus. However, I have also been using them as my leading indicators for how the virus will progress and affect economic actors. What I have seen developing lately is not good.

Singapore is now calling for a shutdown, after they initially did a herculean job of containing their outbreak. I had hoped that they would develop procedures (that we can copy) needed to run an open economy while the threat of the virus looms in the background. But that is not what has happened. Instead, we are seeing growing numbers of new clusters forming, and quickly getting out of control. They are tightening and shutting down their economy rather than opening up more. This is our leading indicator. A government far more responsible and effective than us is resorting to shutting down. 

Taiwan is faring better, but only because of their prohibitive ban on almost all foreign travelers (this is obviously devastating to their tourism sector and broader economy). Their economy and society remains open, with many if not most people having hardly any interruptions to their lives (aside from mask wearing). They are one of only 3 countries where all children are still going to school. However, even their economy is faltering as they try to balance the prohibitive actions needed to contain the virus and the economic need to keep things open. They are proposing an unprecedented stimulus/rescue package to bolster their economy. And I think it's a safe assumption that if they ever do open up to foreign travelers again, especially with covid19 having proliferated as it already has, then they will have to deal with massive outbreak clusters all over their island.

South Korea, which has probably the relatable and relevant model for us to copy, has recently extended its social distance campaign. South Korea is a far larger nation than Singapore or Taiwan. They have a climate similar to Seattle/New York. They had a major outbreak in Deagu but didn't shut their country down. They never even banned Chinese travelers, yes, they had Chinese tourists in their country while the outbreak was happening. They were among the first to widely use Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine as a treatment for Covid19. They had among the lowest fatality rates. They contained their outbreak without shutting the whole country down.

Even South Korea can't truly return to normal and open their economy up.

So why, in our incredible American exceptionalism hubris, and far less competent leaders, do we believe we're going to come anywhere close to normalcy in the near future?

Let's look at the next assumption, that fiscal stimulus would end up as earnings for companies. There's no doubt some will end up as earnings, but only a small fraction of what is being modeled by those on Wall Street.

The average American don't even have $1000 in emergency funds, do we expect them to return to their normal consumption habits when they risk having hospital bills multiples of $1000 just from walking past the wrong person? Do you think Americans, as much as they love to spend, aren't going to put some of that stimulus check in their emergency funds rather than contribute it to the earning of some companies? Sure, there will be some ""forced"" spending of the money (food and necessities), but if anyone is modeling the multiplier effect from previous data, then they really don't appreciate how different this virus makes things. Even in the GFC, laid off people didn't really worry about the heightened threat of being hospitalized.

Finally, some investors believe the Fed and the government literally will do anything to keep the numbers up. If this is true, you should be buying silver (or gold), not stocks.

Monetary actions can be reversed relatively easily. They are far more dynamic tools. Fiscal actions are not. You put money in the hands of spenders, that money is gonna circulate. And you really don't have an easy way of reversing that. If we think the government is going to keep handing out stimulus checks, grants to businesses, and other fiscal stimulus, then the inflation predicted from the GFC will come true for this crisis.

The fall out of inflation will be difficult to truly understand. But I do think inflation will be disruptive enough to the economy that inflation hedge assets will outperform other assets at least in the short term. For example, if inflation goes to 5%, who's going to lend to companies for less than inflation? With costlier debt, equity yield goes down, and again, what investor wants yields less than inflation? Inflation is going to cause all kinds of disruptions. I think the disruptions will come down to less liquidity (credit will vanish with uncertain inflation) and higher economic friction (less efficiency).

So if the response to why the market has to go up is continuous fiscal (and some monetary) actions to prop up spending and earnings, then the question is how will fiscal actions be reversed? How do we get that money out after things go back to ""normal""?

I think if we see equities rise from here, it'll be reflective of inflation rather than inflation-adjusted earnings. Silver would be the play here.

I have a lot more thoughts on this, especially on the time it takes to turn the gears of the financial system and why the inertia is moving us deeper into global recession, not out of it, but I'm running out of time and must end here.

I'm 25 years old (turning 26 in a few months) with about $38,000 in a combination of a Roth IRA and Investment account, but have never invested. I've sat on the sidelines but I am very understanding to the fact that timing the market never works, but my thinking was to take advantage of the market, even if I don't catch the exact bottom i was very satisfied with whatever I could get ultimately. This was in combination with the fact that I didn't feel confident in the market. I want to invest long term but I'd be lying if I said i didn't feel like i could start with a bang being that the markets are down.

Well, fast forward to now. Markets are shooting up, and obviously its hard to sit and watch but also hard to trust anything because my gut tells me that this isn't getting better soon. However, i feel like in order to benefit at all from this, now is the time to make a decision.

My question is, what is the best strategy at this point? Do I DCA $100 every day until I run out? Do I wait and continue to see what happens before investing a healthy chunk? Do I just go all in now with the idea that at some point we'll be back to our highs, and at the very least I've made a good 20-25% of my money?

My main watch list is huge today but I narrowed it down to the stocks on this list. There are many in play so if you don't like any of these, run a scan after the open. The market has printed the ""W"" reversal pattern that we talked about yesterday and is now sitting at the 272 pivot from June of 2019 which should act as resistance however this is a unique situation with the government stimulus/bailout so we will have to see if the market breaks over and can hold that level. Everything is gapping today with the market, yesterday turned out to be a strong day maybe today we see some follow through. Wait for good patterns with defined risk/reward before entering. Business as usual. Good luck trading.

*****

&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to an over 700-point gain at Tuesday’s open a day after President Donald Trump expressed hope about research for treatment of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 1,600 points, or 7.7%, to start the week as data showed signs of new U.S. cases slowing. However, it’s too early to determine whether that’s a trend. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 7% on Monday. The Nasdaq rose 7.3%, bringing the index out of a bear market. But the Dow and S&amp;P 500 remained in bear market territory — declines of at least 20% from 52-week highs. All three stock indexes hit all-time highs in February before states issued stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the virus and the economy ground to a halt.

*****

&gt; * Trump, at Monday evening’s White House coronavirus briefing, said, “There’s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.” The president said 10 therapeutics are in active trials and some are looking “incredibly successful.” Fifteen other potential treatments are “advancing rapidly” toward clinical trials, he added. Trump also said, “Stay inside and let’s win this and let’s get our country [back] as soon as we can. I think it’s going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well.” However, at the same briefing, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the world may never get back to what it considered “normal” before the coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China in December.

*****

&gt; * A warning in late January from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro about the potential severity of the coronavirus in America came as the president was publicly playing down the risks. According to The New York Times, Navarro wrote in memos that the outbreak could cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of infection or death. Navarro is a leading hardliner in trade talks with China. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said another $1 trillion is needed, beyond the just-passed $2.2 trillion effort. The California Democrat wants another round of direct payments to Americans and more money for companies to keep making payroll. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said in recent days that health care should top the list, signaling his intent to get to work on a new bill.

*****

&gt; * World leaders are rallying around U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, wishing him a speedy recovery from the coronavirus. On Monday evening, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London after his symptoms worsened. Trump sent his best wishes, saying: “All Americans are praying for him, he’s a friend of mine, he’s a great gentleman and a great leader.” Johnson announced on March 27 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. He was said to be suffering from “mild symptoms,” but he was hospitalized Sunday evening and moved to the ICU a day later. Johnson’s medical team said the prime minister was conscious and not on a ventilator. Johnson had asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to carry on the prime minister’s duties “where necessary.”

*****

&gt; * Britain’s over 52,000 coronavirus cases are among the top 10 nations with the most infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. However, with 5,385 deaths, the U.K.’s mortality rate was over 10%, second only to Italy’s 12.5% death rate. Italy has the third most infections in the world at over 132,500 but the most deaths at 16,523. The U.S. has the most cases with more than 368,000. The death toll America rose to 10,993. New York state has the most U.S. cases, over 131,800, and the nation’s most deaths, 4,758S. Global cases topped nearly 1.36 million with 75,944 deaths and over 265,500 recoveries.

But logically I cannot fathom how this continues to rise. It dropped over fears of economic lockdown and its risen as case numbers have decelerated. Lockdown or a partial version is still on the cards for much of the world for a long time. 

There are two ways it ends. With a vaccine in 18 months, time or herd immunity and 200,000,000 people infected across America. Goldman Sachs &amp; Morgan Stanely originally predicted that Q3 growth will be 19%¹² and 29%¹³ respectively. The idea that we are going to get over the bump and then everything can be turbocharged back is insane.

Either the coronavirus is far less deadly than the estimations of every expert and study or we have a long time yet under the economic restrictions of partial lockdowns and uncertainty.

Today was a crazy day huh? I posted yesterday a thread that received a lot of negative feedback [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fvo521/who_is_ready_for_a_bull_week/!].

The post I want to make today is about the lesson I learned from making that post, and from watching all of the posts/decisions on this subreddit. That is the idea of Confirmation Bias.

When I am using my money, I cause myself to be personally invested in my financial investment; therefore, I begin to let my emotions take the wheel on my decisions because I am afraid of the outcome. This is where Confirmation Bias comes in. Confirmation Bias is when you only find information to support the thought/belief/view that you already have. 

When we enter this emotion fueled financial investment, we are afraid of being hurt a) financially and b) emotionally at the outcome. When I make my prediction I want to feel supported, I want to feel like I made the right decision, I want to feel like I know what is going to happen. So I log onto reddit, I scroll until I find a title that supports my thought and my thought only...why? Because I don't want to be hurt by guessing wrong. I let information fall by the wayside because I just want to feel good.

This reddit seems to be made up of that and that alone. A whole lot of people posting and commenting ""Yea it is for sure going to be a bear! We haven't even touched bottom! I bought $1000 in SPY Puts!"". When we enter a bull week people HAVE to change their mind, because they're wrong, and by the end of the week the narrative changes slowly with people fighting with the reason why their investments aren't doing what they want to. 

Here is a takeaway I want you guys to have because I want the best for you and I love my fellow humans. 

If you make a decision, or are about to, actively search out information that goes against that decision. This will force you to look at it from the opposite side, and make an INFORMED response, not an emotional response.

We are still slave to our biology, and the stock market doesn't care about your poor decisions. Please find information that opposes your own, because only then you can make clear decisions. I love you.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,373145,public,confidence,self,Healthiest way to make decisions,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fw94ed/healthiest_way_to_make_decisions/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not sure if there will be another market crash like the one in march or even a bigger one.

There is a widespread view on Wall Street that the stock market hit  its lowest level of the bear market last month, and that a combination  of an ebbing of the coronavirus in late spring and unprecedented fiscal  and monetary stimulus will set the stage for a sharp rebound in  corporate profits later this year.

On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA, 7.730%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote), the S&amp;P 500 index  [SPX, 7.033%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) and the Nasdaq Composite Index [COMP, 7.326%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote) [were each rallying](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-rise-as-trump-administration-signals-that-coronavirus-outbreak-may-be-stabilizing-2020-04-05?mod=article_inline) more than 4% on these hopes.

However, Mislav Matejka, head  of global equity strategy at J.P. Morgana warned investors in a Monday  research note that there is a significant chance the global economy  experiences **“a vicious spiral, which is typical of recessions, between  weak final demand, weaker labor markets, falling profits, weak credits  markets and low oil prices.”** 

What’s particularly troubling to Matejka is that the current  recession has been triggered by a shock to the consumer — which makes up  70% of GDP in Western economies — as workers around the globe are  prevented from earning a living by the closures of nonessential  business. This dynamic has led J.P. Morgan economists to predict “only a  gradual bottoming out in activity, such as seen after the Great  Financial Crisis, and not a V-shaped one that we see, for example, after  natural disasters.” A so-called V-shaped economic recession is  typically defined as one characterized by a sharp, but brief, slowdown  in business activity that is followed by a powerful rebound.

The bank’s house view is that the unemployment rate will remain  elevated at 8.5% during the second of the year, while the  peak-to-trough decline in real U.S. GDP will be 10%, versus the 4%  decline during the financial crisis. “And this is all assuming that the  virus is history by June, which might prove significantly optimistic,”  Matejka wrote.

Therefore, he advised clients to ignore technical signals  indicating stocks are oversold, or to be reassured by the massive fiscal  and monetary support provided by global governments. To do so would be  “missing the **elephant in the room, that is the first consumer and labor  market downcycle in 11 years.”**

“While consensus view still appears to be a quick recovery,  recessions tend to linger,” Matejka added. **“It took equities on average 18 months to record the final low in the past.”**

Hello all,

how does it look in US ? Your everyday life ? What does it look outside, how about businesses, are they opened ?

I am from Europe, Czech Republic. We are in complete lockdown, you can only go for a walk in nature, when you leave home, you have to put the mask on or else you can be fined, meeting more than 2 people outside is forbidden, you should not visit people. fathers can be on births, medicine students were forced to work in hospitals, you cant buy food from 7 to 9 morning, this time it is only for seniors, everyone sewed facemask by himself, idk about people being laid off, but government is providing cmpanies money so they dont have to fire people... these measures probably saved us, atleast for now

My plan is to keep 1 year of expenditure savings in case of emergency and then investing 10% of the rest of my savings every week for the next 10 weeks into a Total Stock Market Index Fund as sort of a DCA and then keeping it there untouched for 10+ years, adding to it intermittently in smaller chunks as I can afford to.

*****

&gt; * Dow futures pointed to an over 800-point gain at Monday’s open as improved coronavirus data in Europe offered hope for the United States. Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. “We have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,” Dimon wrote.

*****

&gt; * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were “very close” to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose “very substantial” tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he’ll need to do so.

*****

&gt; * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world — in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries — Italy, Spain and Germany — combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe’s hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain’s 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.

*****

&gt; * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week. Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cook also said Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.

Gap Ups: AAPL, AXSM, CODX, IMMU, LYV, MESO, MU, NUGT, RCL, RDHL, RYAAY, SMPL, TQQQ, W, XBIT

Gap Downs: TVIX, ZM

The SPY is gapping up over 4% at the time I am writing this. Gap days are usually harder to trade. Most large gaps in the market get sold off at open but occasionally they do hold so be aware and stay patient.  As of right now the SPY is holding this temporary support and trying to form a ""W"" pattern but the weekly 200 moving average is still overhead and that's where it got rejected last week. Day to day basis right now until we get out of this range. If market breaks back below last weeks low most likely we will see a retest of the lows, if it breaks above the weekly 200 ma we could see some continuation to the upside as earnings season starts in 2 weeks. Only time will tell.  Almost no stocks moving with individual catalyst. If you are new, this is not the ideal time to trade so don't get fomo, just be patient and only take solid trades with good patterns and have a defined risk to reward before entering trades.

So the epidemic is here and is shuffling the markets. Some people have the balls to predict near-term but that's not what I'm looking for.

I am then looking for companies that in 2 years time will most likely be higher than today's price.

I mean, companies have tons of stocks acquired with bay back programs.

Value is for sure low and it will not help stock price but it is like cash if you sell. Why should the state help entities that have stocks on their portfolio and let them keep what they actually have for free?

I have now passed 100 Subs and am shocked honestly. I truly appreciate all of the feedback and look forward to interacting with everyone in the future. With that being said, Of all of the industries that have been hit by what is going on in the world, Carnival Cruise Lines has taken one of the biggest hits. Aside from that, with 5G starting to take shape, Verizon looks to be a leader with AT&amp;T and I want to add them to my portfolio.  

In this video I go over where I was wrong with Carnival Cruise Lines and explain why I think they are a stock that will have a lot of problems in the coming future. Be it the government currently not bailing them out or that the consumer will need to overcome the fear of being stuck at see in a floating petri dish. I also go over why I am adding Verizon to my portfolio to go along with my AT&amp;T Stock as the 5G market starts to take off. I also go over the cosmetic changes M1 Finance has introduced as they make a sleeker and simpler user interface.

Leave your thoughts below and be open to considerations of new ideas! 

I do believe we will be in a downtrend for the near future, and maybe it will accelerate; however, with some (in my head) estimations this could be a Bull. President Trump and the assisting doctor at tonight's press briefing were purposely relaying statistics to show America that we are starting to approach the recovery phase. There are up bull weeks in bear markets, and this week seems to be a good candidate for one.

The Market obviously wants to go up, and if there is no new information this week to support why it should go down, then it could go up. With the information of unemployment, the extension to April 30th, and any other information that we received this past week we started to see the market ""pricing in"" the impact of all those statistics.

Also, when I see /stockmarket saying it will go down, I start to think that it will go up. 

So a couple questions I would love to see discussion on would be: 
1) WHY would the market go down this week?
2) WHY would the market go up this week?
3) Hypothetically, if we knew the end date of this virus and we start to see what the plan is, what would the market do with that information? If we start to understand the end, does that make everything better, or will stuff take a hit because it will know EXACTLY how much damage will be done?
I would love to hear all your guys thoughts, and see some healthy discussion :)

We look at all of the Form 4s filed anytime an executive buys, sells, or is granted stock, to see if we can find any unusual insider compensation activity (i.e. activity that isn’t part of any prearranged plans like repurchase programs, 10b5-1 plans, incentive programs, performance bonuses, yearly bonuses, etc).

Last week we found W.P. Carey, Solar Capital, and Westlake Chemical Partners.

## 1) W. P. Carey Inc. ([$WPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/wpc/)) - Insider Purchases

\*Unfortunately, we were a little slow in getting our analysis on W.P. Carey out (we found them on March 20th) as we were busy filtering through all the Executive Compensation activity, so the stock has rebounded 18% since we found them. However, they are still a prime candidate to keep an eye on as they are down significantly over the last month.\*

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/wpc/):

&gt;W. P. Carey ranks among the largest net lease REITs with an enterprise value of approximately $21 billion and a diversified portfolio of operationally-critical commercial real estate that includes 1,204 net lease properties covering approximately 138 million square feet.

W. P. Carey was having a good start to the year, reaching a peak stock price of $88.27 before crashing 44% over the last month to a closing price of $49.36 on March 20th (their closing price on March 27th was $60.34).

The recent [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1025378&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) activity shows that none of the executives’ purchases were particularly large from a percentage of their total holdings standpoint, but that is because all of the executives (except for the Chief Accounting Officer) already own over $20M in stock. All of the executives except for the Chief Accounting Officer spent over $400,000 repurchasing stock while the 3 directors increased their holdings by 37%, 20%, and 11%.

The only executive that did not purchase any stock is their CFO.

The individual Form 4 [forms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1025378/000120919120020298/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) show give no explanation for the purchases, so we can assume that it isn’t part of any sort of pre-arranged plan.

The [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1025378/000104746919001969/a2238264zdef14a.htm) verifies that W. P. Carey does have ownership guidelines stating that the CEO must hold 6x their annual salary in the stock, the other named executives must hold 3x their annual salary, and the Directors must hold 5x their cash retainers.

Everyone except for one of the Directors holds a substantial amount more stock than they are required even after taking a 44% haircut on the stock price over the last month.

*\* The Chief Accounting Officers salary was not present in the most recent Proxy Statement \**

|2020-03-16|Christopher Niehaus|Director|$723.2K|$500.0K|$223.2K|

W. P. Carey shows some intriguing insider purchasing activity and the substantial amount of money their top executives have invested in the company shows that they have a lot of skin in the game and are heavily incentivized to get that stock price back up to where it was before the crash.

## 2) Solar Capital Ltd ([$SLRC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/slrc/)) - Purchasing Activity

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/slrc/):

&gt;Solar Capital Ltd. is a business development company specializing in secured debt (first lien unitranche and second lien), subordinated (unsecured) debt, minority equity, and strategic income-oriented control equity investments in leveraged middle market companies.

Like most companies in the Asset Management industry, Solar Capital got crushed by this market downturn falling from their recent high of $21.12 down to their close of $10.62 on March 25th (a 49% decline).

The recent Form 4 [activity](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1418076&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) shows quite a bit of purchasing activity by the executives since the beginning of March (especially by the co-CEO, Michael Gross).

The table below shows that all of the executives (and one director) made sizable 6-figure (and one 7-figure) purchases (except for the Chief Compliance Officer) and all made very sizable percentage increases to their holdings.

|Date|Executive Name|Title|Type|Stock Type|Avg Price|Total Purchased|\# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020-03-23|Michael Gross|Co-CEO|P-Purchase|Common|$9.49|$794.3K|83.7K|249.6K|50%|
|2020-03-23|Michael Gross|Co-CEO|P-Purchase|Common - Indirect|$12.00|$1.1M|92.5K|2.4M|4%|
|2020-03-23|Richard Peteka|CFO|P-Purchase|Common|$8.99|$116.9K|13.0K|24.0K|118%|
|2020-03-23|Bruce Spohler|Co-CEO|P-Purchase|Common|$9.32|$498.9K|53.5K|67.5K|382%|
|2020-03-20|Guy Talarico|Chief Compliance|P-Purchase|Common|$10.35|$33.1K|3.2K|10.4K|45%|
|2020-03-20|David Wachter|Director|P-Purchase|Common|$10.59|$211.8K|20.0K|46.4K|76%|

You will notice above that Mr. Gross made a 7-figure “indirect” purchase on top of his almost $800,000 direct purchase. Looking into his [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1186884/000089924320009195/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) shows us that most of that indirect ownership is through the Employee Stock Plan, Solar Capital Investors, and Solar Capital Investors 2, which both him and the other co-CEO, Bruce Spohler, have an ownership stake in.

According to their [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418076/000119312519222090/d747559ddef14a.htm), it does not appear that Solar Capital has any ownership guidelines. This leads us to believe that these executive purchases could have been made because the executives believe the stock is at a great buying price.

## 3) Westlake Chemical Partners ([$WLKP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/wlkp/)) - Purchasing Activity

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/wlkp/):

&gt;Westlake Chemical Partners LP acquires, develops, and operates ethylene production facilities and related assets in the United States. The company's ethylene production facilities primarily convert ethane into ethylene. It also sells ethylene co-products, including propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline, and hydrogen directly to third parties on a spot or contract basis.

Westlake has had a rough start to the year. They have fallen from a stock price of $22.81 at the start of the year down to a low of $10.31 before making their way back up to a closing price of $16.08 at the close of the market on March 25th.

Over the last two weeks, there has been a substantial amount of executive purchasing activity at $WLKP (Form 4 activity [here](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1604665&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0)).

The purchasing was led by the CEO who bought up nearly $1,000,000 worth of shares between March 10th and March 24th as the stock continued its decline. None of the other purchases were particularly large from a dollar value perspective, but they all notably increased their amount of shares owned from a percentage perspective. We also find that Randy Woelfel, the sole director that made purchases, bought stock in the company for the first time (at a very good price too).

|Date|Executive Name|Title|Type|Stock Type|Avg Price|Total Purchased|\# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020-03-24|Albert Chao|CEO|P-Purchase|Common|$13.75|$962.5K|70.0K|166.4K|73%|
|2020-03-23|Randy Woelfel|Director|P-Purchase|Common|$12.90|$129.0K|10.0K|10.0K|100%|
|2020-03-23|Benjamin Ederington|General Counsel|P-Purchase|Common|$14.75|$29.5K|2.0K|12.0K|20%|
|2020-03-12|Mark Bender|CFO|P-Purchase|Common|$15.00|$30.0K|2.0K|14.0K|17%|
|2020-03-10|Lawrence Teel|""SVP|Olefins""|P-Purchase|Common|$17.40|$87.0K|5.0K|12.8K|

Taking a look at the CEO’s [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1299403/000156761920006871/xslF345X03/doc1.xml), we first can verify that these purchases were not part of any pre-arranged plans. We also notice that Mr. Chao and his family own a significant number of shares through other entities and trusts.

We couldn’t find any proxy statements for Westlake, but their [10-K](http://www.snl.com/Cache/IRCache/c6d33de99-faea-90c8-f9d9-e2b96bd61806.html) does not mention any ownership guidelines that require executives and directors to own a certain amount of stock. It appears that these executives may just believe the stock is at a very good price point and are buying it up.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,371791,public,confidence,self,Recap of Last Week's Unusual Insider Purchasing Activity,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fvhvxa/recap_of_last_weeks_unusual_insider_purchasing/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '16jxFHXnGLmDKC4M3Q9uMUZyOARBNVxPEqecC4TMIC0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f365f35593a8ff5a4345f6ac61b70cfef15e52', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db450c618f53c6c33778e43b211fad788e7e62a', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3493dedbabed68d15d63888f37945dedec7d2af', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 500, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=09218c9750baa74ba3af4f892ae6b67e30677927', 'width': 500}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

* If I calculate it as **Price/((Net Assets-Liabilities)/Number of Outstanding Shares)**, I get a ratio of 1.60 (That would be **3.23/((461001636-174232552)/142550000)** \- those are the official figures from the issuer's website)

I keep reading articles about politicians who were warned well in advance about just how serious and debilitating the Covid-19 pandemic would end up being and, instead of informing the public, sold all their relevant stock holdings before anything else. 

My question is: how is this legal and would this not be considered insider trading? They were given information that, if widely distributed, would lower the value of their stocks so before they allowed the information to be released they made sure to sell their stocks at a higher value before the crash. 

My understanding of insider trading is that it is when a stockholder is given information that would affect their stock holdings and makes decisions based on this information before it is known by the wider public. 

The way it was initially explained to me was with a metaphor about a person who had stocks in a mining company. If that person had a buddy who worked in the mine who called them up and said “hey man, the mine is all but dry and the company owner is going to release a statement tomorrow about it,” then they would know that their stocks’ value was in jeopardy before anyone else. Consequentially, that person could sell all their stocks in the mining company before they became worthless. 

This same principal seems to be applying to these politicians, so I’m confused how they aren’t being taken to court for insider trading.

Fellow investors,

As we all know **COVID-19** is affecting every aspect of our lives, but it is also presenting many buying opportunities in our market. **$O Realty Corp** is one of them.

Some Quick Metrics @ $45/SHARE :

* Current Dividend = $0.233 /Month
* Current Yield = 6.21%
* Total Debt to Total Assets = 43.28
* EBITDA = 29.46
* Debt to EBITDA = 5.87
* Price to Book Ratio = 2.51
* RSI = 34 (not oversold yet)
* Price to Cash Flow Ratio = 21.78

Its current drop 47%-%50 from ATH is the largest drop in the company's stock history. 08-09 it was 42%.

Its historical yield has rarely gone over 5%

16.5 % compound annual total return.

4.5% Compound Annualized Dividend Growth.

Consistently Keep Occupancy Above 97 %

Had a public offering of 9,000,000 shares @ 77.40 that closed March 2nd LMAO

""Net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $677 million. The company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,350,000 additional shares of common stock. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings outstanding under its $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and, to the extent not used for that purpose, to fund potential investment opportunities and/or for other general corporate purposes.""

**Summary**: $O Realty Corp is an **ELITE REIT** that not only trades at a premium to its peers, but rarely trades at an attractive discounted valuation. For long term investors this valuation is an absolute steal. To dividend investors its an opportunity to add world class company to their portfolio.

**RISKS**: **COVID-19** drags on for more than 3 months, dividend possibly in danger. Government Stimulus is currently a ""life-line"" for some businesses that O Realty Corp rents to and if it dries up they go under and O Realty Corp loses a tenant in them. I am sure that Management is doing everything possible to minimize damage and taking advantage of any program and or opportunities that present themselves to fortify the company,",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,371131,public,confidence,self,GREAT VALUE! $O Realty Corp.,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fv4nlv/great_value_o_realty_corp/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been following this company for two years when they announced they wanted to do all these things. 2 years later, they actually made it.

Their Twitter account:

They have all of a sudden became VERY active on twitter, with some big announcements on twitter leading to PRs.

**Here are some of the big company tweets to pay special attention to:**

Announcement that their next revs could be in the 7 figures: [https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1242791018329706498?s=20](https://twitter.com/Global_GCGXOTC/status/1242791018329706498?s=20)

Correction that its actually 1.5 million and not 1.4: [https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1245353093417623552?s=20](https://twitter.com/Global_GCGXOTC/status/1245353093417623552?s=20)

Recent tweet saying this big quarterly report will be posted as early as next week: [https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1246132440051126279?s=20](https://twitter.com/Global_GCGXOTC/status/1246132440051126279?s=20)

Tweeted just now: All t heir inspections have passed. Its all official now: [https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1246487885638971392?s=20](https://twitter.com/Global_GCGXOTC/status/1246487885638971392?s=20)

**Major announcement what would happend if they passed all inspections (Which they just did as of TODAY).**

&gt;[$GCGX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GCGX&amp;src=cashtag_click) \- Indulge Oils: Presents a 4 liter, batch now considered “Supreme Purity” can be refined to over 90 if needed. This will yield FAR greater than our estimated $7,000 per liter. LOI: Production for 25 liters per day $7000+ Per Liter Revenues from this: $175,000 per day

**Company confirms they will be uplisting and initiating a share buy back, just 2 days ago.**

&gt;Yes, the plan is now uplisting, confirmation of share buy back, and dramatically increasing revenues month over month now that the inspections are complete and can initiate the LOI, which is open for roughly $150,000 per day of oil.

**News came out that the oil they were producing came out as 10 points HIGHER in purity, which means it sells for MORE than they expected.**

&gt;[$GCGX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GCGX&amp;src=cashtag_click) \- Indulge Oils: Presents a 4 liter, batch now considered “Supreme Purity” can be refined to over 90 if needed. This will yield FAR greater than our estimated $7,000 per liter.

I think within April we will be over $0.01 - And for the next quarter if the revenues continue, I see it hitting $0.05 with ease.

This is the final of my series of spreadsheets that I am sharing on this sub and opening to the public for copies &amp; downloads.

This here is a real-time U.S. market indices data spreadsheet on Google Sheets.

Someone last week had suggested that I create a new spreadsheet that has the data laid horizontally as opposed to vertically like my other spreadsheets.

This particular spreadsheet is not as data rich as my other sheets. It's a more simpler version. That being said, if I can find some time later this weekend I'll see if I can add more things to this spreadsheet.

Anyway, I just thought I would share this in here for everyone in this sub for those of you who wanted to make your copies as I know I have gotten quite a few requests from this subreddit over the course of the past couple of weeks to give you all the ability to copy my spreadsheet to your own Google Drives.

So, without getting into further ado I present to you all my newest U.S. market indices spreadsheet:

# **The stimulus boost has passed and now the stock market is focused solely on virus developments  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/the-stimulus-boost-has-passed-and-now-the-stock-market-is-focused-solely-on-virus-developments.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market enters a four-day week that is the lull before earnings season, but it’s the headlines on developments around the spread of the coronavirus that may result in the most volatility.
*****
&gt; Strategists say investors are now most focused on how the virus is progressing, what medical developments might help, and how long it could take to end the shutdown of most of the U.S. 
*****
&gt; “I think it’s a wait and see with a drift to the downside. I think if you look back to that three-, four-day rally we had in March, capping off the end of the month, I think a lot of that was reaction to the Fed, a lot of it was reaction to the stimulus out of Washington,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “There were good vibes coming off of that, but that was yesterday’s news. I think the Fed has done a good job. They have peoples’ confidence...One thing we now need is a decline in the number of virus cases in the U.S.”
*****
&gt; Oil could be a factor in the week ahead as OPEC and Russia hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss production cuts. Oil rallied 12% in the past week with West Texas Intermediate futures at $28.34 per barrel, its best week ever.  President Donald Trump sparked the rally when he said he spoke to Saudi Arabia and Russia and they wanted a deal to cut production. 
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks were lower for the third week in four, as the market absorbed the latest shocking reports of layoffs, and investors worried about the duration of the virus related shutdowns. The S&amp;P 500 closed down 2% for the week, at 2,488.
*****
&gt; # Jobs picture
&gt; On Sunday, Trump extended the guidelines on social distancing to April 30, as the number of cases grew.
*****
&gt; Thursday’s report of 6.6 million new unemployment claims for the week ended March 28 brought the two week total of workers filing claims to 10 million. The biggest data report in the week ahead could again be that jobless claims number on Thursday.  
*****
&gt; “We look for 7 million new claims to be reported for the week ended April 4, though obviously the range of uncertainty around this forecast is wide, and a substantial decline is also possible,” noted J.P. Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton.
*****
&gt; Consumer sentiment is reported Thursday, and consumer price index inflation is reported Friday, when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday.
*****
&gt; “I’m not a big believer that investors gain a lot of information from single points of data and even less right now,” said Mike Swell, co-head of global portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We need the world to open back up. We need the global economies to open back up to have any sense of the lasting impact of this on jobs. The concerns in corporate boardrooms is how conservative they’re going to be when it comes to cap ex and hiring.”
*****
&gt; The Fed releases minutes of its last meeting Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “The schedule doesn’t matter anymore. What matters now is how the pandemic is playing out, the extent of the downturn of the economy, and then how capital markets are functioning,” Swell said. “All of those things together are going to drive what the Fed’s going to do, and they’ll act when they need to take action.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has flooded the markets with liquidity and is ballooning its balance sheet with Treasury and mortgage purchases. Swell said the Fed’s programs are helping the markets they’ve taken aim at including corporate debt, mortgages and commercial paper.
*****
&gt; # Earnings ahead
&gt; First quarter earnings season is scheduled to start in the week after next, and there could be more companies withdrawing guidance between now and then.
*****
&gt; “We’re all facing the realization [the virus shutdown] that it’s going to take longer, it’s going to go deeper and that alone is taking the wind out of the sales,” said Calvasina. “Then the companies are going to report , and they’re not going to tell us anything...companies are just withdrawing guidance. It’s not even like there’s a new lower bar. Are we going to come out of this with a bar or are we going to come out of this with no direction?”
*****
&gt; According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline about 5.5% for the first quarter, which saw the biggest impact from the virus in the final weeks of March. 
*****
&gt; Calvasina said she expects the market to retest the lows of March 23, in part because it does not seem investors have gotten negative enough. She said they do not appear to be factoring in the latest gloomy projections from economists of a more than 30% decline in second quarter GDP. She said the market could still have a ways to go before bottoming, and notes the financial crisis drop was 49%. A drop of that magnitude would take the S&amp;P to 1,727.
*****
&gt; Her own survey of clients shows that many investors still have a bullish view on the market with a six to 12-month horizon. “We’re seeing investors taking a constructive view. They like what the Fed has done.There seems to be a view about the economy that the damage is really going to be concentrated in the second quarter, and it’s going to be contained in terms of depth and contained in terms of duration,” she said.

# A Technical Look at Market Internals

&gt; Following last week’s more than 10% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Index is tracking toward another weekly loss, its fifth of the last seven. This has many investors wondering if a retest of the lows may be in the cards for US equities. As we explored in our How Markets Bottom post, two of the bear markets we believe show the most similarities to our current one did retest or undercut the lows after the worst of the selling.

&gt; “Whether or not we get a retest is an open question,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But we believe we’ve seen the worst of the selling, and we will be watching to confirm that fewer individual stocks are making new lows on a further pullback in the indexes.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-picture-4.3.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, although the S&amp;P 500 made its low on March 23, more stocks actually bottomed a week earlier on March 16, when more than two-thirds of the individual stocks in the index hit a one-year low. Regardless of the direction of the S&amp;P 500 over the coming days, we want to see this trend of fewer stocks making new lows continue.

# Road to Recovery Playbook Factor #1: COVID-19 Case Update

&gt; Factor #1 in our Road to Recovery Playbook is finding confidence in the peak of COVID-19 cases in the United States. At LPL Research we are monitoring this factor daily, and we wanted to provide an update into what we are seeing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, while the number of new cases in the United States has continued to climb, the number of new cases seen outside of the US has begun to drop in recent days. In fact, Italy, the worst-hit country in terms of total deaths from the virus, reported on Tuesday that new cases hit a two-week low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/picture-blog-cases-pandemic.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; This data is important because thus far the number of COVID-19 cases has conformed to Farr’s Law of Epidemics, exhibiting a somewhat predictable bell curve normal-like distribution. Formulated in the 1800s by British epidemiologist Dr. William Farr, these laws predict that epidemics normally follow a pattern of sharp increase, a peak, and then a decline back to a baseline.

&gt; The distributions of both new COVID-19 cases and related fatalities in China and South Korea have exhibited this behavior and appear to have ridden out the initial outbreak cycle. The City of Wuhan, China, which was the initial epicenter for the virus, reported on March 19 that it had zero new cases—showing us that the curve can be flattened and there is light at the end of this dark tunnel.

&gt; “The market’s bounce last week may have been in anticipation of some of these more positive data points regarding the virus,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While US cases continue to climb, the more countries that reach their peak, the more clarity we gain into what that timing may look like for the United States. Investors have historically been rewarded for investing during these crisis events, and we believe the time for suitable investors to consider adding some risk to their portfolios may be approaching.”

# Can April’s Top-Month Record Extend Market Rally?

&gt; April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&amp;P 500. The window for the seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. The unprecedented speed of the current market selloff and current bear market would appear to have made this year’s signal insignificant. This could be the case, but it is far too early to say if the worst of the bear market is over. Double-digit DJIA losses during the “Best Six Months” have only occurred three times (ending in April in 1970, 1974 and 2009) since 1950. In 1970 &amp; 2009 the “Worst Six Months” were positive while in 1974 DJIA slide another 20.5%.

&gt; April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fourteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&amp;P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

&gt; The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. This year, guidance will likely be the greatest focus, as first and second quarter earnings are likely to be disappointing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Historically bullish election-year influences (the second-best year of the four-year presidential election cycle) have the exact opposite effect on April. Average gains since 1952 are approximately half of the average gain of all years since 1950 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500. Largely due to a 15.6% loss in 2000, NASDAQ’s typical strength in all Aprils since 1971 is transformed into an average loss in election years.

&gt; This data is important because thus far the number of COVID-19 cases has conformed to Farr’s Law of Epidemics, exhibiting a somewhat predictable bell curve normal-like distribution. Formulated in the 1800s by British epidemiologist Dr. William Farr, these laws predict that epidemics normally follow a pattern of sharp increase, a peak, and then a decline back to a baseline.

&gt; The distributions of both new COVID-19 cases and related fatalities in China and South Korea have exhibited this behavior and appear to have ridden out the initial outbreak cycle. The City of Wuhan, China, which was the initial epicenter for the virus, reported on March 19 that it had zero new cases—showing us that the curve can be flattened and there is light at the end of this dark tunnel.

&gt; “The market’s bounce last week may have been in anticipation of some of these more positive data points regarding the virus,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While US cases continue to climb, the more countries that reach their peak, the more clarity we gain into what that timing may look like for the United States.

# Down Best Six Months Not Encouraging

&gt; The depth of this waterfall decline may be too deep for the market to rebound quickly. This bear market also put this year’s Best Six Months (November-April) at risk of being negative. The record of down Best Six Months is not encouraging and it reminds us of a salient quote from the Almanac from an old market sage, “If the market does not rally, as it should during bullish seasonal periods, it is a sign that other forces are stronger and that when the seasonal period ends those forces will really have their say.”— Edson Gould (Stock market analyst, Findings &amp; Forecasts, 1902-1987)

&gt; The table below of Down Best Six Month for DJIA since 1950 also suggests caution and patience is in order. Subsequent Worst Six Months (May-October) have averaged losses with only two decent years 1982 and 2009. The market bottom in August 1982 marked the end of the 1966-1982 secular bear market and came of the early 1980s double dip recession. Following the first back-to-back down Best Six Months since 1973-1974, the market hit a secular bear market low in March 2009. Market action in the rest of these years was rather grim.

# Sector Relative Strength

&gt; Over the past year, the Technology sector has been the most notable sector in terms of outperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the charts from our Sector Snapshot below, the relative strength chart for Technology has been in a steady uptrend for the past twelve months without much interruption even while the decade long bull market was coming to an end. In fact, last week it was the first sector to exit oversold territory after every sector was oversold for 13 days. The other sectors have not been as lucky. During the recent sell off, the relative performance of most sectors, especially cyclicals like Energy, Financials, and Industrials, fell sharply (indicating even worse declines than the S&amp;P 500). Consumer Staples and Health Care, on the other hand, have seen much stronger performance than the rest of the market.

# Consumers Turn Bearish on Equities

&gt; Tuesday's Consumer Confidence report managed to exceed expectations, but as we noted at the time, the survey for the March reports cuts off on the 18th, so as economic conditions turned south, sentiment levels also likely declined. One area of the report where sentiment already has seen a notable decline is in consumer sentiment towards stock prices. As shown in the top chart below, the percentage of consumers expecting stock prices to decline nearly doubled from 21.7% up to 39.2% while the percentage of consumers looking for higher prices dropped from 43.1% down to 32.3%. In the case of negative sentiment, the percentage of bearish consumers hasn't been this high since late 2012.

&gt; Given the major shift in sentiment, the spread between bullish and bearish consumers has seen a major reversal falling from firmly positive (21.4) to firmly negative (-6.9). By this measure, the spread between bullish and bearish investors hasn't been this negative since February 2016.

# The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly Commodities in Q1

&gt; Very few assets have been winners recently, especially in the commodities space. As shown in the table below, no major energy or metal commodities (front-month futures) rose in March and gold was the only one to rise in the first quarter. The degree of those declines varied greatly. While gasoline and WTI futures (crude oil) were more than cut in half, gold and iron ore fell less than one percent in March. Considering iron ore's cyclical nature, that small decline is somewhat surprising but as for Q1, iron ore's performance was much weaker with a decline of over 10.5%. Granted, that is still a far better performance than copper which was down by more than twice that. Given the size of these declines, every one of the commodities highlighted below sits well off of its 52-week high. Gasoline and crude oil are the worst of these at 74.14% and 69.63%, respectively. As for where they finished the quarter relative to their 52-week lows, things are mixed. Gasoline, gold, and silver are off those lows by double-digit percentages while the rest are less than 10% away.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Table-2.png))**

&gt; As with many charts across assets, the technical picture of these commodities looks ugly. Almost every one has broken below significant support levels and safe-haven gold is the only one currently in anything other than a downtrend. Although it finished the month just off of the lows, crude oil fell all the way to its lowest levels since 2002 after crashing through support in February. The same can be said for gasoline. Natural gas remains a pain trade with the downtrend of the past several months still firmly in place.

&gt; Given its safe-haven status, gold has again been an outperformer approaching some of its highest levels of the past decade during the risk asset rout of the past couple of months. But it has recently been a more volatile trade. The yellow metal has yet to break above resistance around 1,700/oz and has even fallen to support around the 50-DMA. Despite also having the precious metal status, silver has been a serial underperformer to gold. Silver never shared gold's rally over the past couple of months as it fell to its lowest levels since 2009.

&gt; As for industrial metals, copper has been hovering around its lowest levels since the final quarter of 2016 after falling through the past year's support around $2.50. On the bright side, the technicals of iron ore have been slightly more constructive as it has still held up at support around $75.

Luckin Coffee may need some luck and happiness with the latest headlines that hit the fast-growing coffee chain in China. It’s a main rival to Starbucks.

I couldn’t help but notice when I was reviewing one of my stock holdings, Starbucks, I noticed quite a few articles about a competitor called Luckin Coffee. 

Is it Time to Buy Luckin Coffee Stock after Shares Crashed 80%? The Next Starbucks?

One title said, “Luckin Coffee shares plummet 75% after finance misconduct investigation launched.” 

The Luckin Coffee stock hit over $51 not too long ago and the stock closed at $5.38 - down another 15% to end the week. Luckin Coffee seems to be a very popular stock especially for investors looking for growth companies.

When a company gets hit by a scandal, its stock usually plummets and as an investor, your first instinct may be to sell and cut your losses or if you were on the sidelines, you may want to jump in and buy some shares at the new, reduced price.

To summarize, Luckin Coffee (LK) saw its shares plummet after it released a media statement saying that it became aware of a discrepancy during an internal audit of its financial statements for 2019. The Internal Investigation indicated that “misconduct, including fabricating certain transactions’ spanned the 2nd through 4th quarters of 2019 and included amounting to around $310 million.

Luckin also acknowledged that ""certain costs and expenses were also substantially inflated by fabricated transactions during this period."" 

It's disturbing news from a company that has spent heavily to battle Starbucks (SBUX) in China. Let’s listen in to some details about Luckin Coffee and the comparison to Starbucks and it’s online delivery business model.

Luckin Coffee focuses on better pricing than Starbucks. Taking on Starbucks, even when you're the home team, is not an easy feat. The stock went public in May 2019 and its first trade was at 25.00, 47% above the $17 IPO price.

When it comes to investing, you always have investors that are long a stock (thinking a stock will go up in value) and on the other side, you have the shorts (thinking a stock will fall in value).  

Jim Chanos had a short position in Luckin Coffee. In the video, Jim Chanos said he moved on from his short position. Jim ends by saying that he feels China &amp; United States relations have been really harmed. 

To end this episode, I wanted to point out that I am a part-owner of Starbucks Corporation which is why I wanted to discuss the current update from one of it’s competitors in the industry. This is not financial advice. I am just providing my personal opinion on the matter.

In regards to Luckin Coffee’s it’s important to take a step back and evaluate what has happened, how the company has handled it, and where the stock price may go in the future. The all-time HIGH was $51.38 and the stock price closed at $5.38 at the time of this recording. 

Many investors may see this as a buying opportunity and others may think the stock will go to $0. Unfortunately, many new investors may have purchased shares in the 30’s and 40’s and already saw a drop over 80% in their original investment.

If you are looking to buy shares of Luckin Coffee at these levels you may believe in the company's long-term business model and think the stock is oversold at this time.
 
Will Luckin Coffee make the right moves to get back on course? Time will tell. 

Are you LONG or SHORT Luckin Coffee?

Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.

Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.

The market took a roller coaster all week and ended down 1.5 points. I'm new to this and made stupid decisions based off not reading enough outside of major news networks. I read a lot yesterday and felt in my best judgement to sell everything and move it SPXS before close. This worked out for me to recover losses that would have otherwise continued until things began going up.

This decision was based on my overall thought that the market is taking another swing down. I don't know how big but I believe the next 2 - 4 weeks will end down between 10-20% from today. The lack of spending is going to kill our economy. Companies are not buying new products and in turn companies are not selling products. This hasn't been included into the market price right now. Oil can only go up so much before the lack of demand takes a major toll.

My plan right now, subject to change based on what comes out this weekend, is to continue my SPXS for until mid-week next week. What are your plans for next week after today's close?

Just bought stocks in 3SOI which is an inverse leverage ETF. For those of you who do not know, if the oil price goes up this goes down by 3x the %. If it goes down this ETF goes up by 3x the %. 

The reason why I am saying this is because the oil price is just beginning this month, with Russia and Saudi in a standoff. Russia is in no way standing off because they would like to destroy the oil industry. This is worse than the pandemic itself. 

Trump stated a deal would happen but this is likely because he just wanted the stocks to rally when unemployment was about to drive Dow Jones down. 

Russia even said no talks happened. 

My prediction is oil prices will go down, and anybody holding shares in oil companies should sell and invest in the inverse ETF stocks on crude OIL.

Oil will run out of storage in weeks and this will drive the prices to literally $10 dollars per barrel. This will be in 2-3 weeks or so. I will sell and buy in 3x leverage ETF in other non oil stuff. 

The above is a london based ETF stock so highly recommend buying an american version of the above, or in another market.

I'm currently sitting at work and i've been researching for what feels like two weeks now on how to find pivot points during pre market hours. The reason I'm asking is because i use a scanner that finds stocks gapping up from the previous close and for the most part its been successful I just don't have good pivot points or any to show support and resistance for the day. Since the stock is gapping, the pivot points usually fall way below since it's higher than previous close.  

\-For example, my scanner had the top choice yesterday (4/2) being $IO. I bought shares at $1.88 and ended up selling close to $2.50. Profit is profit so i'm happy about it but if i could find the pivot points I could watch the charts more accurately and make more informed decisions as opposed to just selling when the stock jumps. I also provide the top 3 from my scans to my friends and would like to share the pivot points with them as well so i dont have to try and rush to let them know when to sell or hold.

If anyone could help me with this or point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it!

Gap ups: BNO, CVE, FATE (sitting at 50 DMA), HUYA (sitting at 50 DMA), LVGO,  TSLA, TWTR, UCO, 

STZ was gapping but has given up the gap, will have to watch after open to see if it is worth trading

Gap downs: MIC, NGG + RACE both have low average daily volume

Possible day 2 plays: CLX, CVX,  MRNA (day 2 plays need to break over previous days close and hold to be valid)

Not much moving pre market at all and I am not a fan of the list today. This is expected due to the state of the market as well as earnings season approaching. Usually the couple weeks before earnings get slow as everyone awaits releases of reports. Trading will pick up soon, in the meantime we just trade what we can. Due to the lack of gappers, it is a good idea to run a scan after the market opens to find stocks to trade. Market above $250 psychological support is a good sign, have to see if it holds here. if not, most likely it will test the 234 support or maybe even the previous low. Most likely the choppiness will continue today so be patient, only enter on solid patterns setups with defined risk to reward in mind.

I've been looking for answers everywhere and I cannot find nothing, maybe because its just a dumb question that doesn't even make any sense, reason why there is no answer for it.

So basically, I've been following these advices on how to retire younger than expected by investing on Index FUND or Index ETFs.

In my personal jouney, so far I've bought 2 shares of SPDR at a very decent price on RH.

Now my question are:

1) Do you keep on buying the same Index ETF/FUND? is it recommended?

2) Do I get dividens indiviadually from each company in the S&amp;P 500 (distributed in cents) or I only a get ONE ""mix"" dividens from the S&amp;P gains, if any.

3) Do these dividens grow overtime? (seen a lot of advices, like, buy these INDEX and keep for 10-20-30 years, etc)

4) Would you consider buying Index ETF on RH? if so, which ones (for the LOOONG term, about 20 yars)

5) What about these Index ETF compared to Index FUNDS on Vanguard?

Good evening fellow traders,

I wanted to see if someone could please help me understand this option position.  I am looking to Sell and Put on $CRC at the $1 strike for 1/15/21 Expiration at $.80/contract. 

If I write 10 contracts at $.80/contract I will receive $800 in premium, which makes my break even $.20/share. 

So if the stock stays at $1 or skyrockets to $100/share I am safe and collect the $800 premium with no repercussions. 

However, if the stock dips to $.50/share I risk the chance of being assigned and have to purchase the stock at $1.00/share. 

But if I take a $.80 premium per share my break even is $.20 giving me a 1/4 risk reward ratio. 

Is my thought process correct and is this too good to be true?

23 years old, was watching the little mini 3 day bull run last week and put $9,000 into Jets ETF and bought 500 shares at $18.00.

One week later I am -$2,600. The ETF has lost 30% of it’s value. I am so depressed that I made this mistake. Is there anyway that this ETF hits at least $17 again before the end of the year?

Additionally, capital spending and new store construction has been halted along with dividends and share buybacks.

What does this mean?

 I'd like to say good luck to any of those mom and pop shops that use local banks that rely on good relationships and customer service to fuel their business. The government is going to take care of the big lenders first and make sure their needs are met before moving to helps smaller chains and brands.

This also means that the longer it takes for loan dispersion the longer it will take small businesses to get back up and running. This will lead to more bankruptcy's and longer unemployment claims. A majority of the bigger banks don't even have a clear understanding of the regulations and and rules associated with the loans. Some have even gone to the extremes of emailing their customers and informing them that they will most likely not be accepting applications tomorrow.

What's the point in getting all this relief approved if the infrastructure to get it administered properly isn't in place?

Look into bank stocks being as if more stimulus is approved Banks are running anywhere between 1%-5% on loan origination fees. Any loans that are not approved for forgiveness after two months are also subject to .50% interest.

They will run the deficit up even higher and use that money to fund government projects that aim for full employment. Once that is reached inflation will be kept in check via taxation. Thus taking metals out of the equation entirely, reducing their value to what it is for industrial purposes. Fits in nicely with the stories of Fort Knox being empty/filled with fake gold. The rest of the world will be left holding what is by then useless gold and silver. Japan will do the same. The dollar will dominate instead of hyperinflating...
The EU could go down this path also but only if it becomes one large country like the US, where the current member countries will be like states in the US. All sovereignty of EU nations will be cancelled to achieve this.

One way to improve the situation for Corona patients could potentially be to use so-called convalescent plasma, ie blood plasma from recovered individuals. This plasma contains antibodies to the virus in question and can thus potentially help the affected immune system to fight the disease. The products delivered are part of a project in this area. **The company's product can help increase availability of blood plasma, including convalescent plasma, by removing the blood group barrier.** In addition, potential problems with immune complex formation with, for example, AB plasma (containing soluble AB antigen) can be avoided.

deposit...\n\nThere are three reasons why Syndicate Bank is important in the evolution of India as a wealth generator, and for working towards the upliftment of the masses.\n\nFirstly, it was born out of a belief that an innovative person cannot really generate wealth for himself on a sustainable basis unless he works out a way to make his community wealthy as well.\n\nSecondly, it was the only large bank in India to locate its headquarters in a rural area – in the 1930s Manipal was still a village.\n\nThirdly, even before CK Prahalad arrived on the scene, its promoters knew about how wealth could be found at the bottom of the pyramid. At a time when all banks insisted on Rs 5 as the minimum deposit amount to open an account, Syndicate’s promoters opened accounts with just 25 paise.\xa0Unfortunately, this is a story that most management schools too do not teach.\n\n**History**\n\nThe bank itself was a brainchild of Tonse Madhav Anant Pai, who went to Bangalore to study medicine.\xa0 He excelled in his studies, and when earning his licence to practise medicine, he went back home to the fishing village of Malpe.\xa0 He asked his parents if he could go to Japan for further studies, but was told sternly by his mother that he should stay in the same village and practice medicine for the welfare of the people he grew up with.\n\nThat broke the boy\'s heart. He wanted to study more.\xa0 And he knew that a fishing village would provide him neither money, nor the intellectual challenge.\xa0 He was proved right.\xa0 In six months\' time, he confirmed that a fishing village had only colds, fevers, diarrhoea, dysentery and indigestion as regular ailments.\xa0 He tried persuading his parents one more time to let him go overseas for further studies.\xa0 Once again, he was rebuffed. His relatives would talk of how the boy would go to sleep sobbing into his pillow crying over the unfairness of life.\n\nTill one day, he had his Eureka moment. He realised that one reason why he was not earning enough was because the people around him were also not earning enough.\xa0 Could he change that? He began strategizing a social revolution that India had never seen or imagined.\n\nHe knew, as a doctor, that children are brought o doctors invariably by mothers; seldom by fathers. So he focussed on the women who came to him.\xa0 He began urging them not to let their children end up like their fathers who were good only for fishing and then getting drunk when they returned to home base. The cleaning of the fish, selling them, managing provisions, balancing incomes with expenses was left to women.\xa0 If there was any surplus money, the man demanded it, and got drunk with that money.\n\nSo he urged the women to save.\xa0 But they told him that there wasn’t enough money for saving.\xa0 He would then ask them to show how much money they had.\xa0 They would show him a few coins.\xa0 He would gently take a 25 paise coin from each woman and tell her to start with this.\xa0 Since he was not a bank, he kept two notebooks for each woman – one kept with him and the other with the woman.\xa0 He told them that he would send his compounder over to her house every day when the husband was not around.\xa0 If they could save 25 paise, the amount would be registered in both the notebooks.\xa0 The scheme, backed by constant persuasions and exhortations, worked.\xa0 Women began saving.\xa0 In a few months, Pai realised he had more than a thousand rupees – which translates into a few lakhs using today’s valuations. The 25 paise deposit scheme came to be known as the Pygmy Deposit scheme.\n\nIt was time to go to phase 2 of the plan.\xa0 He told them that their children were falling ill very frequently because they consumed only fish and rice.\xa0 He urged them to give the children a glass of milk every day.\xa0 That was impossible. A glass of milk was unaffordable.\n\nSo Pai urged them to buy a cow for their houses.\xa0 They laughed: ""We cannot afford a glass of milk, and you want us to buy a cow?"".\xa0 But Pai gently told them that he could finance the cows for the women. And repayment was also painless, he explained: ""Just give your child a glass of milk, and I shall purchase the rest of the milk from you and adjust the cost of the cow.\xa0 You don\'t have to do anything else.""\n\nIt took a while to persuade the first woman.\xa0 But when she agreed, it was a game of ""me too"". Within a short while, there were so many cows in the village that Pai could not purchase all their milk.\xa0 He therefore formed a milk cooperative.\n\nTo handle the amount of money coming in he started a bank - Canara Industrial and Banking Syndicate Ltd - with its headquarters in Manipal. The first branch of the bank started its operations in 1925 at Udupi in Karnataka. By 1937, it had secured its membership as a clearinghouse in Mumbai. He then started weavers’ cooperatives, who too were financed by the bank. Then to benefit the community he began schools, then colleges and then institutions that taught engineering and medicine.\xa0 This complex later became the prestigious Manipal Educational Complex.\n\nIn fact, to grow the bank, Pai used to look around for good businessmen, who had the urge to grow and both the ability and willingness to repay the amounts borrowed.\xa0 In one of his travels, he met a trader, whom he helped get a yarn licence from the government.\xa0 That businessman was Dhirubhai Ambani, And that is how a member of the Pai family remained on the board of Reliance Industries as long as he was alive. Syndicate Bank used to be the lead agent for all loans syndicated by Reliance even through they did not have the largest share. Ananth is also the name of Dhirubai’s grandson - the name was apparently given by Dhirubhai as he held Ananth Pai in great regard.\n\nSource -  [Moneycontrol](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/the-little-known-story-of-once-private-syndicate-bank-which-started-with-a-25-paise-deposit-4422221.html)', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;With bank mergers taking place and banks losing their identity, here is a little-known story of once-private Syndicate Bank, which started with a 25-paise deposit...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons why Syndicate Bank is important in the evolution of India as a wealth generator, and for working towards the upliftment of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it was born out of a belief that an innovative person cannot really generate wealth for himself on a sustainable basis unless he works out a way to make his community wealthy as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it was the only large bank in India to locate its headquarters in a rural area – in the 1930s Manipal was still a village.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, even before CK Prahalad arrived on the scene, its promoters knew about how wealth could be found at the bottom of the pyramid.

The market is opening flat which isn't necessarily a bad thing and usually this tends to happen a couple weeks before earnings while things slow down. AA reports earnings on April 15 to kick off earnings season so although it may be slow for while here while the market digests all this news regarding viruses and stimulus packages, the action will pick up again in the following weeks to come.I usually don't trade stocks under $5 but lately thats what has been gapping so I am forced to put them on the list.

Right now we will have to see if the SPY continues to decline to the previous pivot level from 2018 at 234 or if it tests the recent low at 217. Maybe it doesn't test them and moves higher, no one knows at this point. Until we see some direction, patience will be your friend. Only take good setups with defined risk/reward. If you are new, this market will be a bit choppy so trade smaller than usual.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday’s open ahead of what’s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.

*****

&gt; * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week’s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month — before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.

*****

&gt; * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening’s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is “on track” with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the “ultimate game changer” in the fight to control the pandemic.

*****

&gt; * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a “very, very painful two weeks,” estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 — nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total. But it has the most deaths, 13,155.

*****

&gt; * Boeing — whose stock has been slammed by the coronavirus economic halt and last year’s grounding of its 737 Max fleet — is reportedly set to start offering early retirement and buyout packages to workers. Several media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, said that an internal announcement is expected as soon as Thursday. Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take “a few years” for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.

I am in my late 20's. This will be my first stock purchases, not looking to put too much in as this is my first step in. Somewhere about 2K USD would be the amount. Won't be touching it for the next 5 to 10 years, giving time for world's economy to heal and yield possible dividends.  
I have been watching two different Bank stocks, one hotel stock and a Technology stock (all from Asia's market) for the past three weeks.   
Since then, i've began visiting r/StockMarket, reading daily news of CNN on USA and visiting local newspaper sites daily. I am trying to find a co-relation of any sort between the NYSE and Asia's Stock.   


Example is : If DJI plummets, would it impact all other stocks around the world?  


As i read further into the subreddits, i notice people keep pointing out that stocks are ahead of the world and the news. Stocks prices reflects what will happen in a month or two with the world's economy and the pandemic that is going on right now.   


Questions to the seasoned traders/economics, that might have traded since the 2008 market and before.  I would like to ask, are we in the middle of recession? Are we at the beginning of it?   
Is the 23rd March dip a gone and bygone or it's a start of it all?  


The answers don't have to be right or wrong, i would just love more opinions. Making this small investment count for a later time  


One of the bank stocks that i have been watching :

From the peak in early Nov 2007 to the bottom in March 2009, it went from 2861 to 666, a decline of 76.7% in 16 months.

The Feb 2020 high was 9838 so a decline of the same percentage takes it to 2293.

Now, the chance we see this happen in the immediate term depends in a large degree on how successful trials of the anti-viral drug remdesivir go. If they fail, and if no vaccine is on the horizon, we could see a decline of this magnitude by the end of this year and possibly before.

But even if remdesivir works markets will still decline, although less so. The reason is because the drug is only being tested intravenously, which means we'll have no data on it's bioavailability in pill form, so even though there will be a treatment doesn't mean we can relax restrictions and allow millions to get sick and end up in the hospital needing IV drips of the drug. Also, success here will likely mean it will reduce death but not eliminate it. And there will be side effects, I promise you that.

Gilead, the maker of remdesivir, said the other day they'll have some results in weeks, which I take to mean sometime before the end of April.

So we'll find out soon enough.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,367997,public,confidence,self,UPDATE-MARKETS SET TO RE-TEST THE LOWS BUT HOW LOW CAN THEY GO,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ftbcqe/updatemarkets_set_to_retest_the_lows_but_how_low/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personally, I like this thesis—and, so far, it's been paying off.

But I'm curious as to why this trade doesn't seem to be positively impacting [SFL](https://www.sflcorp.com). They are a solid company (look at their EPS and FCF growth over time), they have consistently been profitable, and they even pay a dividend. But throughout the contango, their stock has basically followed the S&amp;P—yet they aren't a major company where most of the stock is passively owned.

USA revenue breakdown:

40% = legal collections, ie they sue people for the money

60% = call center / regular collections aka voluntarily payments

Voluntary payments stop when the the deadbeat loses their job. Wage garnihsments stop when the deadbeat stops getting wages and most creditors cannot garnish unemployment benefits. Their revenues are being hit on both sides.

&amp;#x200B;

Most civil courts are closed or closing. Debt collectors wait until the statute of limitations is almost expired to sue. This means the statue of limitations is expiring on many cases. By the time the courts reopen the deadbeats will be even more broke and that stimulus check will be spent already.  Imagine buying debt that already not being paid, and then the biggest financial distaster in history hit thus increasing the chances 1,000,000% that the debt won't be paid.
