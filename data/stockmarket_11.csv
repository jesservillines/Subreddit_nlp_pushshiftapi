When did the market bottom out? | Week of March 16, 2020
Which of the three major indexes dropped the least? | NASDAQ dropped 29%
Which NASDAQ sub-index dropped the least? | NBI dropped 19.7%
Which NASDAQ sub-index recovered the best from the bottom | XAU jumped 75% from its bottom

My Questions

1.	Is this a valid model? It makes sense to me, but I am not expert and may be missing something obvious.
2.	If this model is valid and a crash is coming, is it viable to reinvest in NBI companies to generate some gains in the sort term while protecting our investments in the medium term. Of course the better move it to cash out, but when?
3.	If this model is valid, would it make sense to invest in XAU companies as soon as we see a bottom. 


Thanks for any help and recommendations.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If a million ""traders"" made 100 trades a day for 50 years of 36500 the number of bets that the investor did there is no way that any trend of beating the market could be luck.

Although I tend to think trading is a waste of time unless you are a mathematically genius with 10,000 computers its interesting to consider that all ""great"" investors tend to make fewer bets. Therefore the lucky make lots of money and become famous and we ignore 99.9% of the rest that become an uninteresting graveyard of unknown losers. 

Warren Buffet, is the most obvious example. Very few bets with a large proportion of his gains being concentrated in a few bets like Goldman Sachs, Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and recently Apple. Obviously a very skilled investor, but likely also a very lucky one too.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and the Euro Stoxx 50 Index have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 benchmark since mid-May, and are on track to beat Wall Street for the first full month since last September, helped in part by a rotation into cyclical and value shares.

That‚Äôs something I thought I could try. I looked into it and I saw that every website asks for the ID and the bank account number. Understand that I‚Äôm not familiar with this, so I don‚Äôt really trust them. I saw eToro on TV so I thought it‚Äôs something I could trust.

# **Fragile economic recovery faces first big test with June jobs report in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/jobs-report-will-be-a-litmus-test-for-economy-as-investors-focus-on-surge-in-virus-outbreaks.html)**
*****
&gt; The second half of 2020 is nearly here, and now it‚Äôs up to the economy to prove that the stock market was right about a sharp comeback in growth.
*****
&gt; The first big test will be the June jobs report, out on Thursday instead of its usual Friday release due to the July 4 holiday. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 3 million jobs were created, after May‚Äôs surprise gain of 2.5 million payrolls beat forecasts by a whopping 10 million jobs.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs stronger, it will suggest that the improvement is quicker, and that‚Äôs kind of what we saw in May with better retail sales, confidence was coming back a little and auto sales were better,‚Äù said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets.
*****
&gt; The second quarter winds down in the week ahead as investors are hopeful about the recovery but warily eyeing rising cases of Covid-19 in a number of states.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower for the week, as markets reacted to rising cases in Texas, Florida and other states. Investors worry about the threat to the economic rebound as those states move to curb some activities. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 16% so far for the second quarter, and it is down nearly 7% for the year. Friday‚Äôs losses wiped out the last of the index‚Äôs June gains.
*****
‚ÄúI think the stock market is looking beyond the valley. It is expecting a V-shaped economic recovery and a solid 2021 earnings picture,‚Äù said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. He expects large-cap company earnings to be up 30% next year, and small-cap profits to bounce back by 140%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the second half needs to be a ‚Äòshow me‚Äô period, proving that our optimism was justified, and we‚Äôll need to see continued improvement in the economic data, and I think we need to see upward revisions to earnings estimates,‚Äù Stovall said.
*****
&gt; Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said she expects the recovery will not be as smooth as some expect, particularly considering the resurgence of virus outbreaks in sunbelt states and California.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúNow as I watch what‚Äôs happening I think it‚Äôs more likely to be rolling Ws,‚Äù rather than a V, she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just predicated on a second wave. I‚Äôm not sure we ever exited the first wave.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Even without actual state shutdowns, the virus could slow economic activity. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean businesses won‚Äôt shut themselves down, or consumers won‚Äôt back down more,‚Äù she said.
*****
&gt; # Election ahead
&gt; In the second half of the year, the market should turn its attention to the election, but Sonders does not expect much reaction to it until after Labor Day. RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Democrat Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump by 10 percentage points, and the odds of a Democratic sweep have been rising.
*****
&gt; Biden has said he would raise corporate taxes, and some strategists say a sweep would be bad for business, due to increased regulation and higher taxes. Trump is expected to continue using tariffs, which unsettles the market, though both candidates are expected to take a tough stance on China.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf it looks like the Senate stays Republican than there‚Äôs less to worry about in terms of policy changes,‚Äù Sonders said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever as binary as some people think.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Stovall said a quick study shows that in the four presidential election years back to 1960, where the first quarter was negative, and the second quarter positive, stocks made gains in the second half.
*****
&gt; Those were 1960 when John Kennedy took office, 1968, when Richard Nixon won; 1980 when Ronald Reagan‚Äôs was elected to his first term; and 1992, the first win by Bill Clinton. Coincidentally, in all of those years, the opposing party gained control of the White House.
*****
&gt; # Stimulus
&gt; The stocks market‚Äôs strong second-quarter showing came after the Fed and Congress moved quickly to inject the economy with trillions in stimulus. That unlocked credit markets and triggered a stampede by companies to restructure or issue debt. About $2 trillion in fiscal spending was aimed at consumers and businesses, who were in sudden need of cash after the abrupt shutdown of the economy.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both testify before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday on the response to the virus. That will be important as markets look ahead to another fiscal package from Congress this summer, which is expected to provide aid to states and local governments; extend some enhanced benefits for unemployment, and provide more support for businesses.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúSo much of it is still so fluid. There are a bunch of fiscal items that are rolling off. There‚Äôs talk about another fiscal stimulus payment like they did last time with a $1,200 check,‚Äù said Cummins.
*****
&gt; Strategists expect Congress to bicker about the size and content of the stimulus package but ultimately come to an agreement before enhanced unemployment benefits run out at the end of July. Cummins said state budgets begin a new year July 1, and states with a critical need for funds may have to start letting workers go, as they cut expenses.

&gt; The Trump administration has indicated the jobs report Thursday could help shape the fiscal package, depending on what it shows. The federal supplement to state unemployment benefits has been $600 a week, but there is opposition to extending that, and strategists expect it to be at least cut in half.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 12.2% from 13.3% in May. Cummins said he had expected 7.2 million jobs, well above the consensus, and an unemployment rate of 11.8%.
*****
&gt; As of last week, nearly 20 million people were collecting state unemployment benefits, and millions more were collecting under a federal pandemic aid program.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe magnitude here and whether it‚Äôs 3 million or 7 million is kind of hard to handicap to begin with,‚Äù Cummins said. Economists have preferred to look at unemployment claims as a better real time read of employment, but they now say those numbers could be impacted by slow reporting or double filing.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no clarity on how you define the unemployed in the Covid 19 environment,‚Äù said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs 30 million people receiving insurance, unemployment should be above 20%.

# When Will The Economy Recover?

&gt; The economy is moving in the right direction, as many economic data points are coming in substantially better than what the economists expected. From May job gains coming in more than 10 million higher than expected and retail sales soaring a record 18%, how quickly the economy is bouncing back has surprised nearly everyone.

&gt; ‚ÄúAs good as the recent economic data has been, we want to make it clear, it could still take years for the economy to fully come back,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThink of it like building a house. You get all the big stuff done early, then some of the small things take so much longer to finish; I‚Äôm looking at you crown molding.‚Äù

&gt; Here‚Äôs the hard truth; it might take years for all of the jobs that were lost to fully recover. In fact, during the 10 recessions since 1950, it took an average of 30 months for lost jobs to finally come back. As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, recoveries have taken much longer lately. In fact, it took four years for the jobs lost during the tech bubble recession of the early 2000s to come back and more than six years for all the jobs lost to come back after the Great Recession. Given many more jobs were lost during this recession, it could takes many years before all of them indeed come back.

&gt; The economy is going the right direction, and if there is no major second wave outbreak it could surprise to the upside. Importantly, this economic recovery will still be a long and bumpy road.

# Nasdaq - Russell Spread Pulling the Rubber Band Tight

&gt; The Nasdaq has been outperforming every other US-based equity index over the last year, and nowhere has the disparity been wider than with small caps. The chart below compares the performance of the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 over the last 12 months. While the performance disparity is wide now, through last summer, the two indices were tracking each other nearly step for step. Then last fall, the Nasdaq started to steadily pull ahead before really separating itself in the bounce off the March lows. Just to illustrate how wide the gap between the two indices has become, over the last six months, the Nasdaq is up 11.9% compared to a decline of 15.8% for the Russell 2000. That's wide!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/062620-Nasdaq-vs-Russell1.png))**

&gt; In order to put the recent performance disparity between the two indices into perspective, the chart below shows the rolling six-month performance spread between the two indices going back to 1980. With a current spread of 27.7 percentage points, the gap between the two indices hasn't been this wide since the days of the dot-com boom. Back in February 2000, the spread between the two indices widened out to more than 50 percentage points. Not only was that period extreme, but ten months before that extreme reading, the spread also widened out to more than 51 percentage points. The current spread is wide, but with two separate periods in 1999 and 2000 where the performance gap between the two indices was nearly double the current level, that was a period where the Nasdaq REALLY outperformed small caps.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/062620-Nasdaq-vs-Russell-Performance-Spread.png))**

&gt; To illustrate the magnitude of the Nasdaq's outperformance over the Russell 2000 from late 1998 through early 2000, the chart below shows the performance of the two indices beginning in October 1998. From that point right on through March of 2000 when the Nasdaq peaked, the Nasdaq rallied more than 200% compared to the Russell 2000 which was up a relatively meager 64%. In any other environment, a 64% gain in less than a year and a half would be excellent, but when it was under the shadow of the surging Nasdaq, it seemed like a pittance.

# Share Price Performance

&gt; The US equity market made its most recent peak on June 8th. From the March 23rd low through June 8th, the average stock in the large-cap Russell 1,000 was up more than 65%! Since June 8th, the average stock in the index is down more than 11%. Below we have broken the index into deciles (10 groups of 100 stocks each) based on simple share price as of June 8th. Decile 1 (marked ""Highest"" in the chart) contains the 10% of stocks with the highest share prices. Decile 10 (marked ""Lowest"" in the chart) contains the 10% of stocks with the lowest share prices. As shown, the highest priced decile of stocks are down an average of just 4.8% since June 8th, while the lowest priced decile of stocks are down an average of 21.5%. It's pretty remarkable how performance gets weaker and weaker the lower the share price gets.

# Nasdaq 2% Pullbacks From Record Highs

&gt; It's hard to believe that sentiment can change so fast in the market that one day investors and traders are bidding up stocks to record highs, but then the next day sell them so much that it takes the market down over 2%. That's exactly what happened not only in the last two days but also two weeks ago. While the 5% pullback from a record high back on June 10th took the Nasdaq back below its February high, this time around, the Nasdaq has been able to hold above those February highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/062520-Nasdaq.png))**

&gt; In the entire history of the Nasdaq, there have only been 12 periods prior to this week where the Nasdaq closed at an all-time high on one day but dropped more than 2% the next day. Those occurrences are highlighted in the table below along with the index's performance over the following week, month, three months, six months, and one year. We have also highlighted each occurrence that followed a prior one by less than three months in gray. What immediately stands out in the table is how much gray shading there is. In other words, these types of events tend to happen in bunches, and if you count the original occurrence in each of the bunches, the only two occurrences that didn't come within three months of another occurrence (either before or after) were July 1986 and May 2017.

&gt; In terms of market performance following prior occurrences, the Nasdaq's average and median returns were generally below average, but there is a pretty big caveat. While the average one-year performance was a gain of 1.0% and a decline of 23.6% on a median basis, the six occurrences that came between December 1999 and March 2000 all essentially cover the same period (which was very bad) and skew the results. Likewise, the three occurrences in the two-month stretch from late November 1998 through January 1999 where the Nasdaq saw strong gains also involves a degree of double-counting. As a result of these performances at either end of the extreme, it's hard to draw any trends from the prior occurrences except to say that they are typically followed by big moves in either direction. The only time the Nasdaq wasn't either 20% higher or lower one year later was in 1986.

# Christmas in July: NASDAQ‚Äôs Mid-Year Rally

&gt; In the mid-1980s the market began to evolve into a tech-driven market and the market‚Äôs focus in early summer shifted to the outlook for second quarter earnings of technology companies. Over the last three trading days of June and the first nine trading days in July, NASDAQ typically enjoys a rally. This 12-day run has been up 27 of the past 35 years with an average historical gain of 2.5%. This year the rally may have begun a day early, today and could last until on or around July 14.

&gt; After the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, NASDAQ‚Äôs mid-year rally had a spotty track record from 2002 until 2009 with three appearances and five no-shows in those years. However, it has been quite solid over the last ten years, up nine times with a single mild 0.1% loss in 2015. Last year, NASDAQ advanced a solid 4.6% during the 12-day span.

# Tech Historically Leads Market Higher Until Q3 of Election Years

&gt; As of yesterday‚Äôs close DJIA was down 8.8% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was down 3.5% and NASDAQ was up 12.1%. Compared to the typical election year, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are below historical average performance while NASDAQ is above average. However this year has not been a typical election year. Due to the covid-19, the market suffered the damage of the shortest bear market on record and a new bull market all before the first half of the year has come to an end.

&gt; In the surrounding Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday‚Äôs close) to All Years and Election Years. This year‚Äôs performance has been plotted on the right vertical axis in each chart. This year certainly has been unlike any other however some notable observations can be made. For DJIA and S&amp;P 500, January, February and approximately half of March have historically been weak, on average, in election years. This year the bear market ended on March 23. Following those past weak starts, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 historically enjoyed strength lasting into September before experiencing any significant pullback followed by a nice yearend rally. NASDAQ‚Äôs election year pattern differs somewhat with six fewer years of data, but it does hint to a possible late Q3 peak.

All of shareholders awaiting on some news on KTOV on NT-219‚Ä¶.by end of Q2 which is Monday or Tuesday. Now, given the major press releases by the company in the past couple months, I have no doubt something is coming. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also, on their website and investor presentations, a timeline was released. Notable pages include 23 and 30  
http://kitovpharma.investorroom.com/presentations
https://kitovpharma.com/pipeline/overview/
&amp;nbsp;

Merck‚Äôs drug is Keytruda is not as effective without KTOV‚Äôs NT-219 drug. KTOV‚Äôs latest tweet hashtags #keydura. Merck‚Äôs latest tweet includes ‚ÄúHead and Neck Cancer Update‚Äù which is exactly what NT-219 does! Coincidences here‚Ä¶? 

‚ÄúWhile no response was observed with Keytruda¬Æ alone or with NT-219 alone, and the tumors aggressively progressed, mice treated concomitantly with a combination of Keytruda¬Æ and NT-219 demonstrated complete blockage of tumor progression.‚Äù

&amp;nbsp;

In my opinion, we will hear SOMETHING, whether collaboration or not, given a reputable company knows the impact to shareholder value if timelines are not met. If the announcement is not made, KTOV still has HUGE potential with all of their products and most recent PR‚Äôs

&amp;nbsp;

**KTOV's key products:**  
*NT-219* ‚Äì first-in-class, small molecule dual-inhibitor of two key cancer resistance pathways ‚Äì STAT3 and IRS1/2. [PARTNERSHIP AWAITING ANNOUNCEMENT BY Q2‚Äô20 (June 30). SPECULATION is MERCK or LILLY]  

*CM-24* ‚Äì clinical-stage monoclonal antibody blocking CEACAM1, a novel immune checkpoint expressed in multiple tumor types that supports tumor evasion and survival through multiple pathways. [PARTNER HAS BEEN ALREADY ANNOUNCED - BRISTOL MYERS, ‚Äúold news‚Äù] 

*Consensi‚Ñ¢* ‚Äì fixed-dose combination of celecoxib and amlodipine besylate for the simultaneous treatment of osteoarthritis pain and hypertension. [LAUNCHED IN Q1‚Äô20, BUT UPCOMING ER WILL INCLUDE $ FROM THIS PRODUCT. HUGE POTENTIAL and targets over 50M adults alone. This retails for $1,000+ at Costco, Walmart, and other pharmacies. ‚Äúold news‚Äù]

&amp;nbsp;

**Institutional Investors: 6% of outstanding shares:**

Morgan Stanley, UBS, Hudson Bay Capital Management, and more.  
Now‚Ä¶.here‚Äôs the kicker. Look at the stats of holders who are ‚Äònew positions or increased‚Äô vs ‚Äòsold out positions‚Äô. Why would these huge companies continue to stay in this position if they did not see the potential here of this company?

&amp;nbsp;

**Timeline of events:**  
There were multiple public offerings that took place to fund their research that I won‚Äôt call out specifically. Do your research. If you are a chart person, KTOV has been creating daily cup and handles within cups and handles, all signifying a bullish run and upside.

**Jun 26** - Red market. While the market was bloody on Friday, KTOV has maintained it's level of supports &gt;$1 (2nd day of NASDAQ compliance)

**Jun 25** - Bullish run and volume coming in, new 52 week high, direct offering CLOSED. KTOV maintains support at $1 (1st day of NASDAQ compliance). Huge shorts in play on this day‚Ä¶ currently ~15%. All things considered, support levels are good

**Jun 23** - Leading up to this day, there was a bullish run and HUGE volume. Then things got weird and a direct offering hit and the share price went down due to panic sellers and stop loss triggers. Think about it‚Ä¶this is not as impactful as a public offering which creates dilution of shares. It is DIRECT public offering of $35m at $0.90 with NO new shares created. Here‚Äôs the kicker, this was closed on Monday where $KTOV‚Äôs price was at $0.77. Why would a huge company take this big of a leap of faith on a price that is higher than the current share price / give away money unless there‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt know about and something big is happening with $KTOV‚Ä¶ Huge short interest here

**May 22** - KTOV gets FDA clearance to conduct clinical study of NT-219

**May 19** - KTOV presents preclinical data on NT-219 
https://www.cnn.com/business/newsfeeds/globenewswire/7922882.html

**May 14** - KTOV presents Phase 1 data on CM-24
https://apnews.com/821c2fa1215d6f3c8766b9ddbf9d8389

**Mar 12** - KTOV provides update of US Launch of Consensi (launching May 2020) and 3 year revenue forecasts. Kitov is eligible to receive up to $99.5 million in milestone, reimbursement payments, and royalties. The Company expects to receive aggregate milestone and royalty revenues of between $28 million and $36 million from 2020 through 2022. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Other:**

1 - Merck recently filed a 8-k quietly, which the alternative here is that Merck buy NT-219 outright. Low possibility given the timeline of KTOV, BUT something to consider here  

2 - Surface Oncology ($SURF) - Recently announced a collaboration with Merck on May 20. Price hovered around $2.3 and jumped to a high of $7.66 at this time. That‚Äôs over 100% on this collaboration news alone with Merck.  

3- KTOV has healthy balance sheet, and $19M cash as of Jan 2020 and now likely more due to the offerings. EXPECTED revenues from Consensi alone is $&gt;28-$36M in 2020-2022.   

4- KTOV's Chief Medical Officer, Bertrand Liang signed a $52M partnership deal with Merck while he was CEO of Pfenex. A FEW days before the partnership PR, a $24m was raised to start the study‚Ä¶. Coincidence?
https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfenex-grants-exclusive-license-to-merck-co-inc-for-production-of-proteins-for-undisclosed  

5- KTOV‚Äôs CEO‚Äôs recent followings include PR associates at JV Public Relations NY  

6- This company‚Äôs all time high was $6.56 back in 2016, 3.81 in 2017 and recently created a 52-week high at $1.40. IMO- the range and upside here is high and a target of $2-$5 is not unreasonable.  

7- Notable big boys in KTOV on discord, stock twits, twitter, and other sites. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Closing:**  

Now, if you don‚Äôt believe the DD here, go do your own damn DD. I am bullish on KTOV but this is just my opinion.

The quick boost when the oil price went negative was nice and all, but did nothing for the overall fact that the sector has been in a prolonged bear market for the past half a decade. It seems as though, like often can be seen in cyclical industries, the tide is turning for this sector and several catalysts confirm this. If a shipping bull market materializes, it is often a crazy ride that has more in common with a cryptocurrency boom or a uranium market.

Below you can read a part of the following article, where the possibility of a shipping bullmarket is discussed:

https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/is-bull-theory-on-shipping-stock-rebirth-just-wishful-thinking/ 

‚ÄúThe tide has turned. Market sentiment could not ignore the strong fundamentals forever. We see significant upside in all shipping segments,‚Äù asserted Hannisdahl in his just-released quarterly outlook.
Hannisdahl is most bullish on listed tanker owners. ‚ÄúThe segment is our top pick, with an expected 143 percent surge in our oil tanker share index by the third quarter of 2020,‚Äù he wrote. The company‚Äôs index is comprised of 10 U.S.- and Oslo-listed companies including DHT (NYSE: DHT), Euronav (NYSE: EURN), Frontline (NYSE: FRO), International Seaways (NYSE: INSW) and Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT).
In dry bulk, Hannisdahl predicts ‚Äúone of the longest cyclical expansions since the 1740s.‚Äù The analyst anticipates that Cleaves‚Äô dry bulk share index, which covers nine listed companies ‚Äì including Scorpio Bulkers (NYSE: SALT), Star Bulk (NASDAQ: SBLK) , Safe Bulkers (NYSE: SB), Genco (NYSE: GNK) and Eagle Bulk (NASDAQ: EGLE) ‚Äì will jump 47 percent over the next year.

Hannisdahl‚Äôs bullishness extends to gas shipping as well. In the liquefied petroleum gas sector, he predicts Cleaves‚Äô three covered stocks will surge 80 percent over the next year, while in the liquefied natural gas shipping sector, he believes Cleaves‚Äô three covered stocks will rise 40 percent over the next year.
Haugen of Kepler Cheuvreax argued his bull thesis at the Marine Money Week conference in New York held on June 17-19. He said that ‚Äúthe case is building for a prolonged super-cycle‚Äù and predicted that ‚Äú2020 will be the first year since 2007 when all commodity shipping segments will be at a cyclical high at the same time.‚Äù


Make of all this what you will but is seems as though industry insiders, not just this single article, are hopeful of a turnaround. So, if you are still holding the bag from that oil tanker boost 2 months ago, there might be some hope in getting your investment back and possibly even more than that.

There is a way can easily defeat the US Dollar &amp; the Euro with a special strategy.  
 There is absolutely no way for the USA and the West to erase sanctions or have any change to end the current modern slave. So it is better for all the ‚Äúslave‚Äù nations to setup an new additional international financial system to compete with the IMF.  
 

All the current sanction countries such as North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela, etc. and the Asia should setup a brand new start-up global financial system.  
 

**An example of the new one can defeat the US Dollar, Euro is here:**  
 \- Currency rate will based on the inflation rate of each nations and be observed carefully via the other nations, and only change once per week or per month. The final inflation rate will be the result of average rate reported from each other member nations.  
 \- All nations will have to setup a new office to receive report about local government corruption and observe the inflation rates in all other nations. All nations will have the new set minimum base note.  
 \- There will be a trading limit and restriction rule like if reach 1000 dollar per person then that nation will receive a warning, if reach 2000 dollar of import goods then will not allowed to import goods any more but still allow export good, the restriction will lift only your nations debt within the new system back to under 1000 dollar per person.  
 \- All the foreign currency exchange rate via commercial banks will use a same official rates, no any additional rate and random set by each banks like the current one.  
 \- Each nation in the new financial block will have their own rule own permission about how to deal with the other nations from the IMF or any new other financial system.  
 

A currency is always backed by a government and is tell you the stable and life of any nations.  
 But now if you can have a new organization like above then your national currency value will skyrocketing because it will be backed by many nations as well and via the most fair rule which is the inflation rate.  
 

Imagine a new financial organization with Japan, new China, Korea, Vietnam, Russia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Mongolia, which mean all the member currency will backed by over 2 billions people and will going to crush the current US dollar backed by oil and the Euro back by over 500 billions people. And that is just a small Eastern Asia region, if including the West Asia then that will be nearly 4 billion people.  
 

That is the way to defeat the US dollar &amp; the Euro.  
 You do not need gold-backed currency because the most powerful is the knowledge-backed currency.  
 A new virtual invisible government with a virtual currency combine a lot of small individual currencies, what a great strategy !  
 

All the sanctioned nations and the Asia have nothing to lose, they should kick off the great life reset.  
 As long as using only knowledge to fight, but not the Gold physical threat like the North Korea are doing, then it will be perfectly ok for the West.  
 

Hello the Asia the East, if you want to this special strategy, you must get the permission from me the Savior first in advance.  
 

Best Regard,

Sell in May? That didn't work as the [S&amp;P 500 rose about 4.5% ](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html)following a [nearly 13% surge in April.](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-news-043020/h_30c2938d7f160b492de4a71b05c66433) June swoon? Not so much either. The [Dow](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/dow/) and [S&amp;P 500](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/sandp/) are flat this month -- despite the [market plunge](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/investing/global-stocks-coronavirus-fed/index.html) on June 11 and a lot more volatility.Stocks [fell sharply Friday](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/investing/dow-stock-market-today/index.html) following weak results from Dow component Nike ([NKE](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NKE&amp;source=story_quote_link)), concerns about the latest [bank stress tests](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/economy/fed-banks-stress-test-results/index.html) and growing fears of a [second wave](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/economy/second-wave-economy-risk/index.html) of Covid-19 cases.But the tech-heavy [Nasdaq ](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/nasdaq/)has still gained more than 3% in June. And for the full second quarter, the S&amp;P 500 has surged 17%, making this the best three-month performance for the stock market since the fourth quarter of 1998. 

""There are some potential things that are worrisome. In many ways we are going to be living from earnings season to earnings season,"" said David Russell, vice president of market intelligence with TradeStation.

### Earnings stink and risky stocks pop, but don't fight the Fed

""There will be a lot lot of difficulty predicting what earnings are going to be like with a disruption of this magnitude,"" Russell said.There are also signs of speculative froth in the market. [Bankrupt stocks](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/investing/bankrupt-stocks-surge/index.html) have inexplicably soared as of late. So have [IPOs](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/investing/vroom-ipo/index.html) and [blank check special purpose acquisition companies](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/investing/virgin-galactic-stock-spacex/index.html) like Virgin Galactic ([SPCE](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SPCE&amp;source=story_quote_link)), [DraftKings](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DKNG) and electric truck maker [Nikola](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NKLA).But stimulus from the Federal Reserve isn't going away anytime soon. The central bank will almost certainly keep rates at zero for years and it is pumping out trillions of dollars into the economy through various lending programs.""Don't fight the Fed"" is a popular saying on Wall Street. Is it really that simple? It just might be.""Markets are clearly responding to the significant stimulus in the US and throughout the world,"" said Kent Insley, chief investment officer with Tiedemann Advisors. Insley told CNN Business that the massive stimulus from the Fed as well as various programs from Congress should help the market for the foreseeable future. Cheap money will push investors into riskier stocks over Treasuries, which now yield next to nothing.üì∑[Biotech IPOs are booming -- but it's not all about Covid-19](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/investing/biotech-ipos-stocks/index.html)""lt may be a low growth environment but rates are going to remain low. Stocks still look more attractive over the long term compared to bonds,"" Insley said.He added that investors should focus on companies with solid balance sheets that can continue to post decent growth rates. And he said that investors don't have to limit themselves to big tech stocks -- the so-called [FAANGs](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/investing/nasdaq-record-10000/index.html) and Microsoft ([MSFT](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MSFT&amp;source=story_quote_link)).

### Betting on an eventual rebound

Others are also dismissing concerns about weak profits.""In the grand scheme of things, one year of earnings are not that meaningful for the valuation of a company unless there is a major liquidity issue,"" said Sam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners.Hendel said he is worried about heavily indebted energy firms and struggling travel and leisure companies. But he added that firms in other parts of the market, most notably tech, consumer staples and health care, have the ""ballast to withstand an economic contraction.""He favors companies like broadband and media giant Comcast ([CMCSA](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CMCSA&amp;source=story_quote_link)), packaged food and beverage firms Treehouse ([THS](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=THS&amp;source=story_quote_link)), Post Holdings ([POST](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=POST&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Primo Water ([PRMW](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PRMW&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and health care companies Pfizer ([PFE](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PFE&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Quest Diagnostics ([DGX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DGX&amp;source=story_quote_link)).Hendel also thinks it's reasonable to think that a major biotech or pharma company will come up with a viable coronavirus treatment sooner rather than later. That could further boost health care stocks.""We're not trying to call the bottom on Covid-19, but we hope and pray for a vaccine coming as well,"" he said. ""What 9/11 was for the defense sector, Covid-19 is for health care.""More broadly, there are still hopes that stocks won't fall back into a bear market.Merger activity is slowly starting to pick up as companies grow a little more confident that the Fed and Congress will continue to be there as a backstop to keep the economy from sliding further.Ted Swimmer, head of capital markets with Citizens Bank, said that over the past two months, his firm has been positively surprised by the number of companies issuing new capital and talking about plans to grow again.""The government is providing so much support, so I'd be surprised if the market touches the March lows again,"" he said.",self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'rQjV6PXWjjx6_9y7o6PeC8K9JkKg5SlpQi4uu7yL4f4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xz1PMf3x-1ray8u9fpkpaFyKFI4Bhau7YCU3BuI47yE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4bf7a4c8ad7911ae7d542fc6b6eb7f9ece972b2', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xz1PMf3x-1ray8u9fpkpaFyKFI4Bhau7YCU3BuI47yE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8a97f1e3166a442f11b2021a63d9c2b99ddd8e7', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xz1PMf3x-1ray8u9fpkpaFyKFI4Bhau7YCU3BuI47yE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e12e0d19873db501f4841ead76733ffb3eba842', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xz1PMf3x-1ray8u9fpkpaFyKFI4Bhau7YCU3BuI47yE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58260303b01530e9d9e7c794dd6b14cd828fa8d9', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xz1PMf3x-1ray8u9fpkpaFyKFI4Bhau7YCU3BuI47yE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4417fabbd659aae1ad3f056e99078428a146e9af', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xz1PMf3x-1ray8u9fpkpaFyKFI4Bhau7YCU3BuI47yE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3624757ae3c44d8d7264f7550e1a228c47c5faf', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 619, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xz1PMf3x-1ray8u9fpkpaFyKFI4Bhau7YCU3BuI47yE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b16663dd72590a1b0e9f5dfe2e2b49b572e59ddb', 'width': 1100}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

It involves selling covered calls and buying puts.

Say stock XYZ just peaked at $10 and the implied volatility on it is high. 

I would then buy several 100 share increments and immediately sell calls with the shares as collateral. These calls would have an expiration of around 3-6 months 

I then take the money from those calls and buy out of the money puts at 2 or 3 times the number of calls I sold.

So the trade would look something like this. I'm just picking some stock, this isn't the one I'm considering

     Buy 100 shares BAC $23.10

     -1 Call $24 Nov 20   +$2.34

     +3 Put  $16 Nov 20   $0.66 =- $1.98 
 

If BAC rockets past $24 I can still make money and exit when IV dies down.

If BAC crashed hard I make money on the put, and I still have 100 shares when the market recovers.

If BAC slowly goes down to the put strike, my investment total goes down, but I don't lose everything.

Is there a name for this strategy, and is the an inverse of such a thing? Puts tend to be more expensive than calls right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,

They are a junior gold mining company based out of Vancouver, Canada, and are from analysis likely to have a stock value of $10 CAD by the end of the year easily.

Here's some information about the company.  
\- They have some of the top mining executives in the world working with them. So their management is absolutely phenomenal. They also have some of the top geologists in the world on their team. So in terms of everything their team is quite solid.  
[https://turmalinametals.com/about/](https://turmalinametals.com/about/)

\- They are currently working a discovery site in Argentina, which is their San Francisco site. Their preliminary findings from the assays suggest that there should be 79g/t of gold. They have recently commenced phase two drilling operations, and are currently accelerating the process. [https://www.azomining.com/News.aspx?newsID=16368](https://www.azomining.com/News.aspx?newsID=16368)

\- They are currently holding NO DEBT. This is phenomenal, as when looking at other mining corporations operating at a similar production capacity to them, like Freegold Ventures Ltd (FVL:CN) no debt is phenomenal. Not to mention that the market cap of FVL, which is operating with half the gold production of TBX, is 256M vs 89.4M. It is likely that once the dust has settled on phase 2 drilling for TBX they will exceed FVL's market cap in a weeks time. My personal target is $5 by August.

\- The upper management, and insiders have also been buying up the stock like crazy. I think they probably know something we don't. It has also be trading at a higher than average volume lately, in favour of the green direction.

\- Also, look at their 3 month chart history, it has been green skys for a while now, and I feel like it's time to share those profits with you guys.

Catalysts, no dates yet but in short to medium term all likely to happen

1. The assays from phase 2 drilling. We are expecting them to find around 100g/t of gold from phase 2 drilling. This is an absolutely phenomenal value, and would easily make them one of the largest gold discoveries in South America.
2. The actual production of mining said gold would follow the assays almost instantaneously.
3. And perhaps the best reason to invest, Gold is expected to reach all time highs in this impending crash. I've read reports that it's expected to reach anywhere from 3.5k to 10k. If they discover 100g/t of gold from phase two during the crash, it won't only go to the moon, we'll shoot past mars, saturn, pluto, and into the milky fucking way. Without the price of gold going up, I'm expecting a $1B market cap by the end of two years, but this would be fucking insane.  
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2020/06/25/gold-prices-trump-and-covid-19/#74a3a9c32df1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2020/06/25/gold-prices-trump-and-covid-19/#74a3a9c32df1)

In terms of risks

1. There's obviously the impending market crash. It'll hit, and it'll hit hard. That being said, this company has no debt, so they likely will not go under. Not to mention if they report their assays having found 100g/t of gold, then holy fuck this thing will explode and beat the market in a landslide victory. I'm usually not one to average down, but if this thing dips, i'm buying as much as I can of it.
2. Uncertainty about time frame. We believe the assays will be reported sometime next month, but it could also be later. We've emailed the company to try and get a better idea of what milestones they expect to hit and when, but we'll see.

Risk vs Reward  
While the market crash is coming, I think that these guys will come out on top relatively unscathed and possibly doing better than ever. I think it is an acceptable risk to take and a safe bet for those looking to make some steady gains right now.

In summary  
I think this is an incredibly safe investment, especially in a time where there are seemingly no safe investments. I've never been this excited for a company before, and I can say with 95% certainty that this will be green, and likely double digits before the year's close.

Feel free to do some DD on it, let me know anything I've missed. More information never hurts. Love y'all!

Yesterday the markets were quite choppy but ended the day higher. Unemployment numbers showed people are still filling for unemployment at record levels.

Virus numbers are rising and several states are slowing or reversing reopening. Hospitalization rates are rising, ICU beds are quickly filling up. These worsening numbers for 2 days in a row could lead to a Friday selloff. It's a lot of risks holding over the weekend.

**Watchlist:**

**PHCF** is a low float, resistance at $7

**IPDN** is a low float, watching for a setup above $3.50

**EKSO** is a low float, big move yesterday, on watch today

**CRDF** is a low float, support at $5

**TRIB** is a low float, resistance at $2.60

**LODE** is a lowish float, support at $1

**NLS** is a lowish float, resistance at $8.75

**KTOV** resistance at $1.30 &amp; 1.40

**OCX** has resistance at $3.50

**ALSK** has resistance at $2.78

**OCUL** has resistance at $9 &amp; 9.20

**VXRT** was the big winner yesterday, on watch today

**AFMD** has resistance at $4.60's

**AUG** has support at $1.50 and resistance at $1.70

**DVAX** watching for a setup above $8.50

**LLNW** has resistance at $7.50

I bought even more July 17th $45 strike calls on the early morning dip today, and I'm glad I did because those have already doubled in value. These kind of gains rarely happen with monthlies. My plan moving forward is to buy more calls at every dip. 

FLIR has been consistently outperforming SPY since the LAX thermal camera news came out, and there's clear evidence that upwards momentum is building. This rocket is barely off the launchpad. Today's July call volume was up 6x compared to the average and large order volume (orders of $1 million+ that are indicative of hedge fund buying) was up 8x compared to the average. This is likely why it closed at twice the percentage gain of SPY today. 

**As for thermal camera news**: [Yesterday night, the Trump administration designated Hikivision as a Chinese military backed company.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/25/trump-administration-says-huawei-hikvision-backed-by-chinese-military.html) Hikivision is the second largest thermal camera manufacturer in the world after FLIR, and this makes FLIR even more of a monopoly than ever before.

Heron Therapeutics (NASDAQ: $HRTX) is a \~$1.95B market cap biotech company waiting on an FDA decision this week for their non-opioid postoperative pain management drug HTX-011. $HRTX received Fast Track, Breakthrough, and Priority Review designations for HTX-011, underscoring the critical need for effective non-opioid painkillers in the wake of the ongoing opioid epidemic, which was fueled historically in part by post-surgery opioid prescriptions. HTX-011 is an elegant and creative solution seeking to provide a better option to patients post-surgery and minimize the need for opioids. HTX-011 is a proprietary extended release combination formulation of [bupivacaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupivacaine) and [meloxicam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloxicam)\- details about this intriguing synergistic mechanism of action are included below. Exparel, a minimally differentiated bupivacaine product approved for post-surgical analgesia (pain relief), earned &gt;$400M in sales in 2019. Therefore we believe peak sales in the $600 - 1000M range are achievable for HTX-011 based on the potential for clinical differentiation with substantial further upside feasible pending supportive real-world data.

**Key Takeaways**

* We are bullish on the anticipated FDA decision this week and expect to see HTX-011 approved (&gt;90% probability of success), with some serious upside depending on the exact labeled indication.
* Based on prior stock performance and consensus analyst price targets in the $35 - 41.50 range, we believe that an approval this week should drive $HRTX near to or above $30, at which point we would look to exit our position given concerns we have with launching a product like this in a COVID environment.

*See below for further details:*

**Regulatory Background**$HRTX initially filed their NDA for HTX-011 in late 2018, but received a [Complete Response Letter](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/heron-therapeutics-receives-complete-response-letter-htx-011) (CRL) in April 2019 due to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) concerns. $HRTX worked with their contract manufacturer and resubmitted the NDA in October 2019. $HRTX reported in February 2020 that the manufacturing site had been reinspected and the FDA inspector had recommended approval of the site, potentially finally clearing the runway to an overdue FDA decision by the June 26th, 2020 PDUFA date (a three-month delay from the original March PDUFA date). These non-clinical factors are the hardest for us to predict, but we are reassured by the successful reinspection and the fact that FDA did not note any clinical deficiencies in their application.  
**Unique Product Creatively Building on Existing Clinical Options**HTX-011 is an extended release formulation of bupivacaine and meloxicam that is applied directly into the surgical incision site without a needle.

* [Bupivacaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupivacaine) (like other -caine drugs, e.g., lidocaine) is a commonly used injectable nerve blocker to decrease the sensation of pain, while [meloxicam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloxicam) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
* Both drugs are generically available, though HTX-011 is a unique product using a [proprietary polymer](https://www.herontx.com/our-technologies) that enables extended local release, lengthening the effect time.

We think this is an exciting mechanistic approach for a number of reasons:

* Both component molecules are well-established and effective
* Inflammation creates a more acidic environment- the anti-inflammatory effects of meloxicam could mitigate this and improve bupivacaine diffusion, allowing it to exert its effect more efficiently.
* Non-needle applicator could be more convenient and user-friendly than performing multiple injections, as is required with bupivacaine.
* Local administration of meloxicam (rather than intravenous) could potentially minimize systemic effects / concerns with its use.

**Differentiated Data With Potential For ‚ÄúOpioid-sparing‚Äù Language to be Included in Label**HTX-011 demonstrated a superior reduction in pain intensity versus injected bupivacaine across two pivotal P3 trials in patients post-bunionectomy and post-herniorrhaphy procedures, respectively. This was measured by plotting patient-assessed pain intensity on a scale from 1 - 10 at various time points up to 72 hours post-surgery, and then measuring the ‚Äúarea under the curve‚Äù (AUC): a lower AUC indicates lower pain intensity over that time period.

* Beyond a statistically significant lower AUC over the entire 72 hour period, HTX-011 patients also demonstrated a meaningfully lower pain score at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours post-surgery, with the scores beyond that starting to even out.
* This suggests that over the first 48 hours at least HTX-011 measurably reduces the patient experience of pain.

We were also excited to see that HTX-011 significantly reduced the total opioid medication use over that same 72 hour window:

* For the bunionectomy trial, 28.7% of HTC-011 patients were completely opioid-free versus 11% of bupivacaine-treated patients.
* In the post-herniorrhaphy trial, 51.2% of HTX-011 patients versus 40.1% of bupivacaine-treated patients were opioid-free.
* Optimistically, we would hope that this language would make its way into the FDA-approved label, which would be a huge boost for $HRTX as they could then market the product with the claim that it can reduce the need for opioids.

We have some concerns with the dosing used in the trials, with the HTX-011 arms consistently containing a higher concentration of bupivacaine in the HTX-011 combination than the amount of bupivacaine used for the control arms, which could be part of the reason for the superior pain relief of the HTX-011. However we do not think the FDA will get too hung up on this as HTX-011 also resoundly beat the placebo arm. Nonetheless we expect hospitals and other healthcare providers to test HTX-011 in the real-world versus comparable bupivacaine doses before adopting the product widely.  
For context, Exparel, an extended release formulation of bupivacaine was approved in 2011 on the basis of trial demonstrating superior pain relief to placebo with no impact on opioid use: real-world studies have shown that Exparel is not much if at all better than generic bupivacaine, so the strong data for HTX-011 versus bupivacaine sets it up to be perceived as a differentiated clinical offering.

**Other Considerations**$HRTX also has two already approved products in Sustol and Cinvanti, both for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting ([CINV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy-induced_nausea_and_vomiting)). We did not consider these products to contribute meaningful upside as both products are facing challenging commercial environments due to genericization of key competitors. However, having these products in their portfolio means $HRTX already has a commercial infrastructure targeting hospitals, which should offer some synergies with the HTX-011 potential launch.

**Context ‚Äì** The S&amp;P 500 closed +1.1% higher today. The financial sector performed especially strong +2.7%. This gain is a rebound from yesterday‚Äôs more substantial losses. The market initially was lower due to a new daily record for CoVID-19 cases. The rebound, led by the financial sector, occurred after regulators eased restrictions on the Volcker Rule for banking institutions. Today, Texas and Florida announced a pause on their reopening plans. CDC officials mentioned that CoVID-19 cases might be up to ten times higher than what has been reported. The weekly jobless claim report decreased 60,000 to 1.480 million for the week ending June 20.

**Recap ‚Äì** The picks from yesterday did well considering the market increased by 1.1% with FSLY as the notable outlier. CNX (bearish play) 8.86 -.10 (-1.12%), FISV 97.43 +.82, (+0.85%), FSLY 81.41 +5.34, (+6.98%), AMD 51.91 -0.48 (-0.92%). FTCH, a pick from 06/08/20 had an increase of (+19.64%) ending at 17.79.

The Federal Reserve on Thursday voted to require large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases and cap dividend payments in the third quarter.

In a 4-to-1 vote, the Fed will tie the distribution of dividends to a formula based on recent income. The formula sets third-quarter dividends at a level equal to average net income over the past four quarters.Fed Gov. Lael Brainard dissented from the decision.

Heads up, investors: Wednesday‚Äôs selloff in the stock market may be  the start of something bigger, for the five key reasons I cite below. 

The good news is we‚Äôre not going to see a full retest of the  March lows or anywhere near that kind of decline, thanks to several  positive factors in the mix (also below). 

The upshot: It‚Äôll make sense to buy stocks after potential 5%-10% declines in the S&amp;P 500 [SPX, 0.95%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote),       Dow Jones Industrial Average  [DJIA, 1.02%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote)  and Nasdaq  [COMP,  0.91%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote). 

Here are some tactical suggestions.

‚Ä¢‚ÄâFocus on buying a group that I call ‚Äúpublic space‚Äù stocks.  The eight stocks I put in my public-gathering-place portfolio in my  stock newsletter, [Brush Up on Stocks](http://www.uponstocks.com/), on March 17 were up 70.7% by the close June 15, compared with 26.3% gains for the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust   [SPY, 0.95%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/SPY?mod=MW_story_quote).   As the big gainers (and the ones most vulnerable to Covid-19  resurgence fears), they will likely decline a lot, offering the best  opportunity for a rebound when Covid-19 fears recede again...

 ‚Ä¢‚ÄâBuy the most cyclical areas, which will also get hit the hardest. This means energy, industrials and basic materials.  

 ‚Ä¢‚ÄâOwn gold or gold-mining stocks. They are a hedge against potential weakness. ...

 ‚Ä¢‚ÄâDon‚Äôt get too aggressive in selling biotech stocks or the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index         [IBB, 1.09%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/IBB?mod=MW_story_quote)  or SPDR S&amp;P Biotech [XBI, 2.39%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/XBI?mod=MW_story_quote).   Biotech is less likely to sell off sharply, and it may even go up  since it‚Äôs now considered a ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù group that rises on increasing  fears about Covid-19 spread.   

The bottom line: This is not a time when you need to rush into the  markets for fear of missing out. Wait for price. Get out of trades and  positions you are not certain about. But don‚Äôt touch core long-term  positions. A disastrous long-term recession does not appear to be in the  cards. Be wary of using margin. Slowly raise some cash or keep some on  hand.

Then as market weakness develops, scale into stocks getting hit  the most, such as the public-space stocks and companies in cyclical  areas like energy, industrials and chemicals. There are plenty of things  that could crop up to create volatility and better prices, near term.  Here are five reasons why.

When time exactly do IPOs typically get put out and made available? Does the timing vary, or?  


I'm new to trading but there are some I'm interested in tomorrow. I saw the NYSE is doing this in-person but with social distancing guidelines. I know that after the bell rings IPOs aren't immediately available but then go through some procedures and price setting. So it sounds like if there are multiple IPOs, they may all be made available at different times depending on the order they're dealt with, right?

Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

It looks like gold price will TANK all the way to $800-$1200.

Why?

If you think FED will let gold price to continue to go up, you're either not thinking pr do not understand the relationship between gold and the almighty greenback.

Now that FED has been printing money like there is no tomorrow, folks and countries alike have been selling dollar and buying up gold like there is no tomorrow -- they all believe the greenback will devalue like shit.

China in particular, dumping treasuries, stocking up gold, and coming out with Crypto Yuan. Russian has been doing that for a while, and many more are doing exactly the same. The US empire will cease to exist if the trend continues becoz there is literally nothing worthy in the United states except using the reserve dollar to live off the rest of the world, tl;dr-ly speaking.

The explain why we spend $ trillion on the military, and the Deep State has established [**US Dollar SWAP lines**](https://join.katusaresearch.com/vsl-war-on-gold-oil-price/?utm_campaign=VSL-The-War-on-Gold&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Oil-Price&amp;utm_content=VSL-The-War-on-Gold-Lead-Pages&amp;utm_term=Oil-Price)**.**

This shit is designed to bankrupt countries/gold mines not in line with the empire (USA). The SWAP works like SWIFT sanction... No one nation on earth will dare to defy it, or will end up as another banana republic like Iran, North Korea, etc.

So, can country like China beats the almighty Dollar Hegemony? If not, expect gold price to spiral down from now on...

Yahoo finance has all the general info you need to assess a stock in most cases but it'll take a while to learn to navigate for everything.   


Buy stocks with earnings and increasing revenues. You can forget that occasionally but it will be a while before you can learn when.   


**If you can find a stock that goes up (during normal times) in volume more than triple on NO CURRENT NEWS-that is the best way i have found explosive stocks-It may take 2-3 weeks before they start popping. The reason this works is because it indicates the 'wise guys' know something is coming that isn't out yet. Don't use this formula for stocks that have crashed and are now bouncing up.**  
 

Read these boards and watch all the business channels as often as you can-Listen when Buffet speaks. This is to learn basic market and business  principles and not necessarily for specific stock picks   


Don't EVER buy stocks under $4.   If you have to, make sure you can handle a total loss. If you receive a phone call from a broker you don't know to buy one, don't even think about it-just hang up  


Never set a GTC order for more than a week or two at most.  You can wind up buying a stock for forty  that is 25 ten minutes later. Much less likely to happen in a week or two. If you have a GTC  order, you must read the after market news so that you can cancel your order if something weird is going on.  


With short term trading, only trade stocks with good fundamentals that you wont mind owning if things don't go your way.  


Remember  ""No one ever went broke taking a profit"" and You'll never buy at the absolute lows or sell at the highs  

  
Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,

As new cases of the coronavirus and hospitalization rates increase across the country states are finally starting to pump the breaks on reopening.

NY, NJ, &amp; CT have mandated a 14-day quarantine for people traveling from the hard-hit areas. NC has mandated masks be worn in public.

Markets took a dive yesterday after spending 2 weeks moving sideways. The greatest bull rally in history appears to be over as bears have retaken control of the market.

I'm keeping an eye on lower floats. Markets could open with buying.

**Watchlist:**

**PHCF** is a low float, flying in after-hours/pre-market trading. On watch

**ATOS** is a low float, watching for a setup above $4.27

**CRDF** is a low float, resistance at $4.30

**NH** is a low float, resistance at $5

**DLNG** is a low float, resistance at $4

**FPRX** is a lowish float, watching for support at $7

**VXRT** watching for a setup above $4

**WKHS** was the big winner yesterday, on watch today

**KDMN** has resistance at $5.50

**CERS** has resistance at $6.85

**PLUG** has resistance at $7.80",,,,,,,,,,,,

See original post here: [FLIR: The only COVID-19 play that hasn't been played out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/heln3e/flir_dd_the_only_covid19_play_that_hasnt_been/)


I bought more calls. 

At market open, FLIR skyrocketed and was actually up 2% at one point before selling off in the mass market crash the rest of the day. Very unfortunate that the momentum was killed, or I think it would have had a massive spike otherwise. It went vertical in the morning, literally like a meme stock. Unfortunate that the momentum was killed by broader market condition, but I'm still holding because the core ideas of my post are still valid. Resistance is still intact, and FLIR outperformed the market significantly throughout the day. Calls are actually up 40% today even in this mass market selloff. That means more people are willing to take a risk on it than SPY. 

I took this as an opportunity to add to my call position. I bought some higher strike July 45cs in addition to my 40c. Options are a teeny bit more expensive than yesterday, but that happens when market makers start to see potential in a stock. The same thing happened to Tesla, MRNA, and INO before they skyrocketed. Frankly, I think this might be the next big trend because there's no other solution to COVID in America anymore. We can't have another shutdown, and the people refuse to wear masks. Just to even make people feel safe, every business is going to want a thermal camera to show that they're ""Safe"". 

There was some great discussion in the previous thread. I suggest you read it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its been reported online today that the shareholders of the SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) ACTT have approved their merger with Whole Earth Brands.

I'm here to clarify something: ACTT is a growth stock! Why? Two words: Irwin Simon

The Executive Chairman of ACTT (soon to be Whole Earth) is Irwin Simon. Simon took his startup Hain Celestial (HAIN) public in 1992 at a [$2 million dollar valuation](https://freemanmag.tulane.edu/2020/02/28/irwin-simons-second-act/). He aggressively grew the company by both expanding operations but more importantly identifying strategic M&amp;A opportunities. Hain completed more than 50 acquisitions under Simon‚Äôs guidance in the natural and organic industry during Simon‚Äôs tenure at Hain. Brands developed and acquired by Hain include Celestial seasonings tea, Garden of Eatin, Terra chips, Almond Dream, Soy Dream, Rice Dream (milk-replacements) and the Greek Gods yogurt.

By the time Simon left Hain in 2018 Hain had a valuation north of $3.5 billion. For those of you scoring at home ‚Äì that is a return of equity of 1750x or 175,000%; Amazon (AMZN) and Beyond Meat (BYND)-like growth.

ACTT has already made it clear that they have the same game plan for Whole Earth brands. Not only will the stock become popular when it shows earnings quarter after quarter, but more importantly they will be consummating strategic acquisitions 2 or 3 times a year to accelerate the growth of the Company. **The biggest mistake you can make is viewing ACTT through the lenses of its historical performance under its old management. It‚Äôs a whole new ballgame once Simon gets his hands on the Company.** **Simon is a proven disruptor and value creator. At Hain, he disrupted the food industry by bringing to market organic and healthy alternatives that had not been previously available to the masses.**

So ACTT is being sold on the cheap (see below) and the new chief has a plan and will juice up the Company real-quick.

For those familiar with cannabis companies, Simon was brought in as the savior to Aphria in January 2019, after they had major issues and were at risk of a hostile takeover. Simon has since cleared house and re-established the Company on stable growth trajectory, COVID non-withstanding.

**Background Info:**

The shareholders of the Special Acquisition Company ACTT have approved a merger with Whole Earth Brands. Whole Earth Brands will start out with the business units of the Merisant and Mafco. Merisant is the leading brand in the sugar replacement with labels such as Equal, Pure Via, Whole Earth and Canderel. Mafco is a 100-year-old trusted supplier of flavors and ingredients including the Magnasweet and Mafco brands and licorice-based extracts and derivatives. These plant-based products are clean and natural and support keto and other-non sugar diets.

Mafco supplies well-known brands such as Haribo, Hershey Chocolate, Mondelez International and Firmenich (world‚Äôs largest privately-owned flavor company). Whole Earth has a global footprint as they service over 100 countries and have manufacturing facilities throughout the world.

Whole Earth products are distributed in clubs and stores such as BJ‚Äôs, Costco, Walmart, Target, Kroger, Safeway, Albertsons, Publix, CVS, Walgreens, Panera Bread and Starbucks.

**Growth Strategy**

Whole Earth has the potential to grow from 2019 actual net sales of $272M to over $1 Billion. This will be accomplished by (1) product innovation and product extensions (2) North American distribution growth (3) continued penetration into developing economies as well as further entrance into new geographies (4) tuck-in acquisitions of complementary targets. These acquisitions will further trigger additional geographic expansion and new M&amp;A opportunities in vertical businesses.

**Financials and Valuation**

2020 Estimated Financials

For 2020, Whole Earth estimates it will net sales of $270-290M and pro-forma adjusted EBITDA of $63-67M. EBITDA is driven by sales margins of \~23-25%.

The Enterprise Value (i.e. basis for purchase price) is $439M which is 6.75x of 2020 estimated PF Adjusted EBITDA of $65M and 7.6x of 2020 Free Cash Flows of $57.5M. This almost a 50% discount to comparable companies. Utz, an older and less growth-oriented company is being merged into a SPAC (CCH) as well and its price is about 3x as more expensive. It is being sold at an enterprise value of 17x of EBITDA and 20x of FCF. (See pg. 46 investor deck).

**Position to Take**

Both the commons and the warrants are cheap and have the potential for rapid growth. Now that the merger has been approved the risk of the warrants going bad has been taken off the table, and the upside with warrants is greater. For example, if the stock goes to $30 and you purchased one warrant for $2, your total cost would be $13.50 ($2 for the warrant and $11.50 to exercise the warrant) and then once you receive your stock you would sell it for $30. Your profit is $16.50 of profit on a $2 investment (the $11.50 is not part of the investment as you got back your money on the same day- buying and selling the warrant). In the end you had a $2 investment, with $16.50 in profit, or an 825% return on investment. Warrants don‚Äôt expire for five years so you have time to let the stock fly.

Symbols: **ACTT, ACTTW**

**Note:** I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. Don‚Äôt trust anything I say about stonks. Not the owner of DDTG Global.

**Also note:** There was a proposal voted on 6/24 for Whole Earth to redeem some warrants as they want less of them hanging over their head. I don‚Äôt have the details but remember that if there are less warrants, the remaining ones become more valuable. I haven‚Äôt seen any press releases confirming the results of the voting on 6/24. The vote of ACCT and Whole Earth shareholders to approve the merger also occurred on 6/24. People online were saying it was approved but again no press release confirming this fact has been released.

I want to share with you the app I've been working for a while. 

**TL;DR** **Go to** [**notifinio.com**](http://notifinio.com/) **and play with it(sign up is free with no commitment). There you can create an ETF investment portfolio, and the app will maintain portfolio structure accounting for market trends(Stop buying at high and selling at low).** 

About seven years ago, I got love with the stock market. I was trying different strategies on how I can earn money without 24/7 involvement. After some time, my approach emerged into ETF strategy. I realized that if you can't beat the market, then follow it. I should listen to what Warren said...

On top of that, buying ETF is not a very smart idea, as I wanted to hedge against market downturns( e.g. SPY max drawdown is about -50% since 2002). 

That's how notifinio.com appeared. Over there you can choose one of the pre-defined portfolios ([read more](https://app.notifinio.com/portfolios-explained)) or create your own. 

I know it might sound too good to be true, but that's true. Using the website, you can improve your return on the stock market while spending less time managing your investments.

Now, as I explain why I think it was a good deal at $15.81, please tell me why it‚Äôs a bad deal. 

First of all, Nordstrom won‚Äôt go bankrupt. They‚Äôve raised a ton of money before and their properties are worth quite a bit. 

Right now people are just about as far away from wanting to go to a mall as they‚Äôll probably ever be, meaning at this point any change will likely be for the better rather than worsen that situation even more. 

I spy potential especially because off-price retail like Ross Stores has rebounced some but Nordstrom which also operates an off-price business consisting of Nordstrom Rack and HauteLook hasn‚Äôt rebounced one bit; Nordstrom even has an off-price e-commerce business unlike pretty much anyone else. 

Just 14 days ago the stock was at $23.56. While it‚Äôs possible it will take years for it to get back to ~$40 as it was pre-pandemic, it‚Äôs quite likely good news will make it jump quite a bit and approach that recent $23 price. For it to go there, it will have to rally 49 %. I‚Äôll take that and cash my chips. Even if minor good news should turn out to have little effect, I‚Äôm confident news of a vaccine will make it rally past that $23 price. 

Right now, tech is booming. What happens when a vaccine drops? Will people cash their tech chips and invest in businesses that have yet to recover? Nordstrom could be one of those businesses. 

Let me know why I‚Äôm wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I hope this can help everyone here.

I am working on another spreadsheet which will calculate some of the above and also: Gain/Loss, Growth, Annual Income, Cost Basis, Market value and more, this one will also have graphs and charts.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/hbkpk9/how\_to\_invest\_during\_this\_stock\_market\_bubble/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/hbkpk9/how_to_invest_during_this_stock_market_bubble/)

In the comments I told some people that I thought short term investing would be the best for this type of market. I realized I made a mistake of assuming everyone would be willing to accept the high risk and high level of difficulty of short term trading (although I do it, since I'm willing to take the risk and challenge). So I made a little summary of the different strategies. If you are experienced in the market you can skip this post.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Day Trading** \- The most lucrative for a small account (&lt;$1mil) but with the highest fail rate (90%). Only about 8% of people who attempt day trading end up being consistently profitable, making 1% a day. **Level of difficulty:** Very difficult. A lot of studying and research is required. Fast reflexes and fast thinking is a must. Day traders can make money whichever direction the market decides to go. Day trading can be very lucrative in volatile markets like today. **Level of risk** is very high.
2. **Swing Trading** \- Swing trading can be days, months, years, or decades.  Short term swing traders are similar to day traders. They look for momentum and ride along. Longer term swing traders will do a combination of technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Good swing traders expect to make 20% a year. Many day traders eventually become swing traders. Once their portfolios grow too massive, it becomes harder and harder to jump in and out of trades instantly with the limited amount of liquidity during the day. **Level of difficulty:** Moderate. Studying and research is still required. Swing traders can also make money whichever direction the market decides to go. **Level of risk** is high.
3. **Value Investing** \- Warren Buffett would be the prime example of a value investor. Surprisingly, his strategy is pretty simple. He buys when cheap. He'll wait for the Wilshire 5000 to GDP ratio to fall below 0.8 (see chart below). He's buying when everyone else is crying. Value investors pretty much wait for market valuations to become cheap and then buy companies that they know will last forever. Currently, we are at extremely high market valuations, so Buffett's cash balance is at record levels. He is ready to jump in when opportunity rises. **Level of difficulty:** Moderate to easy. Study and research is required but can be done over a long time. The hardest part of value investing is patience. Most people don't have the patience to not invest during an elongated bull market (bubble as some economists call it). Value investors don't think in terms of how much money this company I own is worth today. They know that during bubbles (low interest periods) stock prices will go up and during recessions stock prices go down. They hold regardless. **Level of risk** is moderate [https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/)
4. **Dollar cost averaging (DCA)** \- This is for the average hard working person. Just consistently put money into your retirement account and not even look at it until it's time to retire. You consistently deposit into your account regardless of whether the market is in a bubble or a recession. The key is consistency. **Level of difficulty:** Easy. Unless you are willing to do the studying and research for the above strategies, you want to choose this strategy. **Level of risk** is low.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I got started in the market about a year ago and consider myself a long term investor, buying and holding for the long term.

I'm still fairly new and continuously learning as I go. Definitely not a day trader but I can't help but imagine that it may potentially be a good idea to try buying a large number of shares of a cheaper stock and selling out of it either same day or a few days later (if and when the price of the stock goes up).

I know there are certain drawbacks, most importantly the chance of the stock going down, as well as capital gain taxes but am I missing anything else?

For example, Aphria, as of tonight, trades at $4.48 a share. If you were to throw $1k into it you would purchase roughly 223 shares. After a couple days (provided the stock price goes up) you can sell for a profit. Even if the share price only went up $.50 its still not bad of a profit... right?

What am I overlooking here?",,,,,,,,,,,,

COVID testing stocks are through the roof. For the past month, I‚Äôve been racking my brain trying to figure out what to invest in. After the recent bull market, finding real opportunity is a crapshoot. I've been following the news hoping to find a trend, and I think I've got it: thermal camera temperature screening. This is where FLIR, the largest thermal imaging manufacturer in the world, comes in. Today, I bought $8K in calls and $100,000 in stock. This is 1/10th of my portfolio so I don't take it lightly. 

**The Chart**

Let‚Äôs start with the chart. The stock is currently at $40 support, is forming a round bottom, and looks prime for a bounce. There was some early interest when news came out that Amazon was installing thermal imaging at all their facilities and FLIR went up 15% in a single day. Since then, hype died down and day traders took profit. Because of the low liquidity in this stock, people exiting positions caused it to fall significantly. Now that interest is picking up again, the same low liquidity is going to help this skyrocket. The time to get in is now, especially with the breaking news that LAX is using FLIR for thermal imaging. I expect this to cause a spike in the stock tomorrow once this hits the news cycle. 

Below are some links that I‚Äôve complied. These are small snapshot to show that skin temperature thermal imaging will be the foundation of the reopening. If you search ‚Äúthermal imaging‚Äù on Google News, you‚Äôll see the hundreds of other organizations that have adapted this technology.

**Additional thoughts:**

FLIR has been moving incredibly fast on elevated body temp thermal imaging technology. They recently released new software for this very purpose and are well ahead of the competition and are transitioning to a SAAS model after a massive restructuring. It is transforming into a tech company, but is trading at an industrial valuation. 

**THE MASSIVE CHERRY ON TOP:** 

FLIR has a complete monopoly because it's the only thermal imaging company that has FDA approved products for monitoring skin temperature. Guess what that means?  Every single organization in the United States that is using thermal cameras for body temperature screening MUST use FLIR‚Äôs products. There is absolutely no alternative. That means that every organization listed above is using FLIR. 

https://www.flir.com/discover/public-safety/thermal-imaging-for-detecting-elevated-body-temperature/

**My personal research:** 

1. I called FLIR, pretending to be a customer. Their backlog is months, and they've never had a backlog this huge. 

2. I called over a dozen organizations that adopted thermal temperature screening to ask what vendor they're using. Out of the seven that gave me information, every single one is using FLIR. I even got through to one CFO who personally approved the thermal camera purchase for that facility. He said that only FLIR was considered because it was the only vendor that fit the requirements for human use. This is consistent with them being a monopoly as stated above.

Since then I kept believing the stock market will test the lows again, and here I am 3 months later and we are 40% up from the lows of March (had I left my portfolio untouched) - To make matters worse, I tried to recoup by trading VIX and Oil, jokes on me as I ended up losing another 10%.

Anyways, looking at the recent weeks, it's obvious that the WH and FED are not going to let the market crash again. People are now used to COVID and the world has reopened to an extent (second wave won't lead to a shut down). So,I was thinking of going back in for long term (I buy high and sell low) 

Question is, do we see a small re balancing coming up as we get to quarter end next week? so should I wait for another week? or Do you reckon, since I waited this long, I might as well wait till elections and hope there is a correction?

Then I took a step back and didn't do anything for like 16 months because I was annoyed at myself. 

Just getting back into it and threw $300 in to play around with, and turned that into $1100 overnight.  

I'm done gambling though, I want this $1100 account to bring in some passive income.  

What I've been doing is selling SPY call credit spreads.  

Typically $10 above current price and next day expiration, for example I sold 11 SPY 321/322 credit spreads expiring 6/24 for $22 against the $1100 collateral. 

That's $22 every Mon, Wed, and Fri...or $66/week, or $264/month. 

All against $1100 collateral.  And I'll be adding that $264/month to the collateral to take more and more premium every time.  It's a banging ass ROI. 


My thoughts being, am I stupid for doing this?  I mean SPY is pretty stable and I believe it's reaching the top, and won't make a $10 move over 48 hours RIGHT NOW.  

Of course if volatility increases, the market gets a bit more iffy, I'll pull my $$$ out.  Big news, earnings, whatever.  

But as of now these past 2 weeks it's worked pretty fucking well.  Am I missing something?  I mean it seems too easy almost.  


I know I know ...if SPY does make that $10 jump and I'm all in I lose it all.  But this is just my Robinhood account, for fun. Aggressive high risk high reward.  

I have a Roth IRA I just started last year and maxed it out.  

I'm 23 and okay with taking that risk because the ROI is just too good, as long as I max out my IRA for the year and save for a down payment on a house, I'm fine funding the Robinhood account an extra $50-$100/month + the gains I get from the premium.",,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The SEC believes that people whose account equity is less than $25,000 may represent less-sophisticated traders, who may be less able to handle the losses that may be associated with day trades.

Isn't that MY CHOICE to lose MY MONEY? I have no formal trading experience. I'm 41 years old and my money is very sacred to me because it keeps my family safe and happy. However the $1000 that I have saved up and put aside for trading could go to ZERO and I would still be able to pay all my bill and not need a government bailout from my losses.

Last night was one hell of a night for investors. The [US stock index futures](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing) slid by more than 400 points after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that the trade deal ‚Äòis over‚Äô on Fox News. This came after the long tension between China and the US over the handling of [coronavirus pandemic](https://stockmarket.com/investing/health-care-stocks/3-ai-healthcare-stocks-to-watch-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-06-22).¬†

Later, Navarro said that his comments were ‚Äútaken wildly out of context‚Äù. He said it has nothing to do with the phase one trade deal, which continues in place. Shortly after, Trump also said via Twitter on Monday night that ‚ÄúThe China trade deal is fully intact. Hopefully, they will continue to live up to terms of the Agreement‚Äù.¬†

## 2) Coronavirus News Feeds Continue To Be The Major Highlights

With increasing efforts to reopen the economy across all fifty states in the US. As the market appears to look more hopeful amid business activity gaining ground. Market sentiment seems to cool on news of the spike in cases in certain states. But not to the extent of what we saw in March.¬†

Despite seeing more cases, we note that the number of deaths is declining. That shows the healthcare system is beginning to deliver some positive results. The world is in a better position now if you compare it to a few months ago, with various potential therapies on trial. With social distancing and face masks now mandated in certain states, hopefully, this could slow down the transmission of viruses and eventually eliminate them.

There has been quite a bit of investor‚Äô optimism over the prospect of a global economic recovery. This has been challenged by a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in the US and China, as well as parts of Europe and the Americas.

## 3) US Stock Futures Reverse Course After Trump‚Äôs Reassurance

US equity futures reversed losses after Trump said the trade deal is still intact. Global stocks also rebounded from a sharp dip after Washington retracted Navarro‚Äôs comment. With positive sentiments across Asia and Europe, we could expect the same outcome for the US stock market today.

The friction between the US and China seems to return to the fore after the controversial national security law in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous territory. Not to mention the mistrust between both China and the US on the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. This does indicate that the market remains very sensitive to US-China tensions. Any slight negative remark could put a blow to the performance of the global equity market.

## 4) Oil Price Climbed Higher On Global Recovery Trade-Winds

With hopes of business activities resuming globally, WTI oil has rebounded to $40 per barrel whereas Brent crude is at $43.38 per barrel (at the time of writing). Some analysts have come out with bullish forecasts for the near term. But, plenty of risks remain. With infection rates not slowing down in key markets, it is reasonable to assume that we are going to deal with sluggish oil prices in a prolonged period.¬†

## 5) Gold Likely To Hover Around High Range

The return of the global recovery trade with a lower dollar did not stop the enthusiasm of gold investors yesterday. Gold climbed to an intra-day high of $1763.00, brushing slightly away from the $1765.00 multi-month resistance. The higher gold price appears to be contributed by some strong tailwinds from the US bond market.¬†

However, investors must be cautious and treat the rally of the gold price with not more than a pinch of salt. We‚Äôve seen this before, with bulls severely disappointed as gold retreated from this resistance zone. Until we have a consistent gold price above $1765.00 for an extended period, caution is warranted as a bull-trap is possible.¬†

Looking forward, the US-China story and the pandemic updates are likely to keep entertaining gold traders. Additionally, the preliminary readings of June month PMIs for the key global economies might offer additional clues.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Overnight a US official stated the trade deal with China was ""over"" and futures fell nearly 2%. The President stated that the deal was ""fully intact"" a few hours later. Futures are positive now, up nearly 1%.

The US is expected to announce new tariffs on Canadien aluminum. So we know some trade tensions still exist but not with China at the moment.

China is under pressure from the US for the handling of COVID-19. China is also involved with a military conflict at a disputed border with India.

Domestically was seeing an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. These numbers don't appear to be a major concern for the markets at this point.

I've recently been having a multitude of problems within the Active Trader (in IB) platform, all of which are incredibly annoying and have been detrimental to my ability to trade.

To start off, often times my charts will not update, as in they will not make any candles in my chart, even when I see the bid/ask changing.

Along with this, when my charts do update, it is delayed by a large amount of time, I'd say 15 seconds. For my market data subscriptions I am subscribed to ""NYSE American, BATS, ARCA, IEX, and Regional Exchanges (Network B)"" and ""OPRA (US Options Exchanges) "".

Are these problems common within Interactive Brokers? Are there any fixes to them? I'm loving the  platform itself, but am unable it due to these issues.

Thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been reading books such as Mark Minervi's book on Superperformance for trading but this is mainly based on swing trading and longer-term formations. Could this information translate into Day-trading?  Can I use indicators for Day trading on Swing trading and vice versa?

I know this is a stupid question but I feel that I am confident in trading.

Bears are growing loader as the market rises in the pre-market. The virus is continuing to spread across the country but governments appear reluctant to take any action with elections only a few months away.

Futures are up this morning, bulls are not willing to give up easily and the Fed is on their side. The market has moved sideways for the past week. I think we will see a direction picked this week.

**Watchlist:**

**OXBR** is a low float, watching for a setup above $3

**BBGI** is low float, watching for a setup above $4.15

**TLSA** is a low float, resistance at $7

**MREO** is a low float, resistance at $4

**SBBP** has support at $4.20

**CHMA** has support at $7

**OCX** has key level at $3

**MLSS** watching for a setup above $2.80

**GLG** key level at $2

**TRIL** watching for a setup above $9

**AFMD** has support at $3.75

Nikola is not expecting the production of its trucks to begin until at least late 2021. This delay would be followed by full production capability being met sometime in the second half of 2022. Currently, there are only 39 hydrogen filling stations in the U.S. (35 in California). This number is tiny in comparison to the approximately 25,000 electric charging stations in the U.S. as of March 2020. It would be a considerable feat if Nikola were able to finish developing their truck, construct a manufacturing facility, and construct the hydrogen infrastructure around the country necessary for a fleet of hydrogen vehicles to operate all in just two years.

Hydrogen vehicles are also inherently less efficient than electric vehicles. A hydrogen vehicle requires that 1) electricity be used to produce and compress hydrogen (Nikola claims all its hydrogen stations will use this method with renewable energy), and 2) that stored hydrogen be used in a hydrogen vehicle to create electricity. So basically, electricity is used to make hydrogen, and that hydrogen is then used to produce electricity again. Fully electric cars do not have to convert electricity and are therefore more efficient. Currently, converting water to hydrogen is approximately 75% efficient and requires a massive amount of electricity. Nikola claims that they will use renewable energy to produce all the hydrogen at its stations, which will undoubtedly increase costs further.

The increased costs associated with hydrogen are why both Honda and Toyota have virtually abandoned their fuel cell vehicle development. In fact, Honda's fuel cell-powered Clarity had such low sales that Honda developed it to be a fully electric vehicle that runs on batteries.

Hydrogen is not the way to a more renewable future and is almost always going to be a more expensive and less efficient option when compared to electricity. While I am not arguing that Tesla specifically will be the winner, I do think it will be an electric semi-truck from some manufacturer. Volkswagen, Mercedes, Porsche, and many other vehicle manufacturers are investing heavily in electric vehicles because they know it is the best route to take.

Hydrogen vehicles are not the future.

That‚Äôs Bryn Mawr Trust‚Äôs Jeffrey Mills, who oversees $16 billion in assets, [talking to CNBC on Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/21/market-surge-off-low-is-hitting-a-wall-bryn-mawrs-jeff-mills-warns.html)about what‚Äôs next for a stock market that is poised for declines to start the week. At last check, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**YM00,** **+0.20%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/YM00?mod=MW_story_quote) were pointing to [a triple-digit drop](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-futures-fall-as-global-coronavirus-cases-continue-to-rise-2020-06-21?mod=article_inline).

‚ÄúThe liquidity injection that the Fed is introducing to the market is actually being tapered off,‚Äù Mills went on to say. ‚ÄúStocks are discounting an environment that is not necessarily reflective of not only economic fundamentals, but earnings fundamentals.‚Äù

Mills said that using trailing price-to-earnings as a measure, valuations haven‚Äôt been this high since the tech bubble. In this climate, Mills went to underweight in stocks mid-April.

‚ÄúYou have information that‚Äôs all over the map. Sentiment data isn‚Äôt really clear. One day you get a positive virus headline. The next day you get a negative one,‚Äù Mills said, explaining that investors need not get too bearish or too bullish. ‚ÄúPositioning needs to be somewhat nuanced.‚Äù

A record $2 trillion surge in cash has hit the deposit accounts of U.S. banks since the coronavirus first struck the U.S. in January, according to FDIC data.

The wall of money flowing into banks has no precedent in history: in April alone, deposits grew by $865 billion, more than the previous record for an entire year.

Deposit gains were concentrated at the very top of the industry: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup grew much faster than smaller firms in the first quarter, according to company data.

I'm new to day-trading, there's a deluge of time-consuming information of mixed quality on YouTube. I'd like to learn most quickly.

""Warrior Trading"" by Ross Cameron is the first day-trading learning module I've encountered.

Is it a scam‚Ä¶ or is it an honest entity with good value, provided I'm willing to put in the time and effort to learn?

What about competitors? Are there any worth considering?

WT boasts 5-star verified reviews, and RC boasts verified profitability of his personal trades.

However, TradingSchools-dot-org appears to list only bad reviews about WT and every other group they list. Is there any good option? Is that site's opinion even worthwhile?

This phenomenon reminds me of ""coding bootcamps"" (Hack Reactor, App Academy, etc), which also have mixed reviews, raving love-fanatics, and raving haters.

I want to learn day-trading, and I know my time is valuable. If someone can save me time wandering the web to learn, that's a valid service.

Thank you.

&gt; But banks, which will be cautious lending money in the midst of a recession, are running out of uses for their growing mountain of cash, according to Foran.

My questions to you are, Do any of you have experience with ITPM mabye?, thoughts about taking such a seminar vs doing it all on your own(i'm just an average grade student) . or generally if you think this guy is a crook and his videos are no different then the majority where they just talk about obvious stuff(to the experienced traders ) to get views and make bank on that(to me seems like he is legit saying helpfull stuff to have in mind while trading\\learning)?.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyson received a price target of $83 per share by Bernstein on June 4th, representing a current upside potential of roughly 30%. Bernstein noted Tyson facilities are beginning to reopen with new social distancing guidelines that are designed to limit the spread of the virus within factories. On June 10th, the company received yet another Overweight rating from Credit Suisse with a $75 price target. Credit Suisse noted how declines in slaughter volume decreased dramatically in May and bottomed out in the first week of June as demand began to recover. While the risk remains that a second outbreak could cause headaches for Tyson, financial institutions are starting to see Tyson manage the coronavirus situation much better than before.

Also, on June 3rd, the meat production industry took a significant hit as the Department of Justice indicted four former Pilgrims Pride and Claxton Poultry Farms executives for fixing the prices of their meat. These two companies have been under investigation since 2012 and while Tyson has seen no such charges. On June 10th, Tyson showed its solidarity against price-fixing by announcing that it will be cooperating with the Justice Department to investigate price-fixing within the industry further. Tyson is the first meat producer to announce this cooperation and thus will avoid criminal prosecution. Tyson has been subpoenaed numerous times in the past, with nothing coming out of these investigations.

Tyson remains a substantial investment opportunity in the long-term.",,,,,,,,,,,,

**Summary**

Iovance is well-positioned as the key leader of cell therapy in the solid tumor space. The phase 2 lifleucel data in heavily pretreated melanoma and LN-145 data in heavily pretreated cervical cancer demonstrates compelling efficacy. LN-145 received fast track and breakthrough therapy designation in cervical cancer, and is also in phase 2 for HNSCC and NSCLC. Both lifleucel and LN-145 are being tested in combination with Keytruda, which may unlock substantial value in earlier lines of therapy. Iovance also has a strong foundation for scaled-up manufacturing and rapid therapy processing. Given the acquisitions of leading cell therapy companies by big pharma, we think a future buyout is likely, but may not take place until after commercialization. Regardless of acquisition status, we feel that Iovance has the requisite data and infrastructure to succeed independently. **We will be initiating a position in Iovance, targeting a 3-4% weight.**

**Key Takeaways**

* We project peak sales of \~$630 M in melanoma for lifleucel, \~$500 M for LN-145 in cervical cancer, and \~$1.8 B for LN-145 in HNSCC due to compelling efficacy in difficult to treat tumors and first-to-market status for cell therapy in solid tumors, resulting in a future valuation of \~$44.50/share, a 42% premium on current stock price.
* Lifleucel and LN-145 are widely expected to be approved in their respective indications, and this approval could come as soon as the second half of 2020.
* Substantial upside exists if these therapies demonstrate clinically meaningful efficacy in NSCLC, and if entry into earlier lines of therapy through Keytruda combination is achieved.
* How smoothly Iovance transitions to full commercialization is a key factor in realizing maximum opportunity, particularly as any acquisitions of Iovance appear more likely after product launch.

**Overview**

Iovance Biotherapeutics is a cell therapy-based company that specializes in autologous polyclonal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) production. The key value proposition that distinguishes Iovance from other T cell therapies is developing assets targeting solid tumors in late-stage clinical trials, with the high likelihood of becoming the first T cell therapy to gain approval in these tumor types. Iovance possesses two key assets in pivotal trials:

* **Lifleucel:** This TIL therapy is being trialed in heavily pretreated, PDx-resistant melanoma patients. An ORR of 36% was observed in these patients (improving on standard of care chemotherapy with an ORR of \~10%). 2/66 patients had complete response, with 23 partial responders. These rates were seen across patient segments / prior treatment history. Data was generated in 2L+ patients and includes those who progressed on a PDx therapy. Enrolled patients experienced a mean of 3.3 lines of prior therapy and high baseline tumor burden. Data released during ASCO in late May showed that median duration of response had not been met at 18.7 months, indicating durable efficacy.
* **LN-145:** This therapy is similar to Lifleucel, but is being tested in heavily pretreated cervical cancer, for which it received fast track and breakthrough therapy designation. ORR was 44%, a high benchmark considering these patients had received an average of 2.4 prior therapies. Considering Keytruda (the current standard of care for this population) gained approval in this subpopulation based on an ORR of 14%, we expect LN-145 to be approved. Beyond cervical cancer, LN-145 is already in phase 2 for HNSCC and NSCLC (both as a monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda), which could be extremely lucrative if similar results are seen in these indications. Additionally, phase 1 data in NSCLC showed 2 of 20 patients with complete response ongoing after one year, pointing to a higher probability of success in this indication.

In 2019, Iovance began building a 136 K square foot manufacturing facility in Philadelphia slated for completion in 2021, positioning the company to scale up rapidly for production of their therapies upon approval. Additionally, Iovance has a relatively rapid manufacturing process, with the ability to prepare therapies in 22 days. Overall, in a field that has seen setbacks due to scaling up, Iovance has prepared to avoid these growing pains.

**Epidemiology**

* **Melanoma:** With an overall incidence of \~100 K/year, unresectable/metastatic melanoma represents \~5% of all cases, or \~5 K/year. \~60% receive a second-line therapy, totalling \~3 K/year patients addressable by lifleucel in 2021. ***Unmet Need:*** *Limited options exist for patients that progress on a PD-1, with ORR of chemotherapy hovering around 10%.*
* **Cervical Cancer:** This tumor type has a U.S. incidence of \~13.8 K/year. Approximately \~50% of cases are caught early in progression. Of the remaining 50%, estimations for receipt of 2nd-line therapy vary, with an average of \~35% of patients receiving a 2nd line within 2 years of first-line therapy. This represents a treatable population of \~2.4 K/year in 2021. ***Unmet Need***\*\*:\*\* Chemotherapy has traditionally been the standard of care in this patient population, with ORR of \~15%. Keytruda was recently approved for this subgroup with an ORR of \~15%, indicating high remaining unmet need.
* **HNSCC:** With an overall incidence of \~45 K/year, metastatic HNSCC represents \~33% of all cases, or \~15 K/year. \~50% are expected to receive second-line therapy, totalling \~7.5 K/year patients addressable by LN-145 with an anticipated launch in 2022. ***Unmet Need:*** *Current second-line standard of care include chemotherapy, with response rates of \~10%, setting a low bar for improving on current therapies.*

**Key Inflection Points**

* Iovance is expecting final results for the pivotal trials in melanoma and cervical cancer by second half of 2020 and expects BLA submission within 2020 as well.
* Specifics on when NSCLC and HSNCC phase 2 data will be released have not been shared, and the primary completion data for these studies is set for December 2023. However, we expect additional data on the phase 1 trials to be released sometime in the coming year. If lifleucel can demonstrate an ORR of &gt;20% in NSCLC, we would expect this to be viewed as clinically meaningful and to drive higher valuation.

**Analogs**

* **Yescarta** is approved for 3L+ large B-cell lymphoma. Launched in 2017, Yescarta earned $456 M in 2019, and is priced at an annual cost of \~$375 K.
* **Kymriah**, also approved in 2017 for B-cell precursor ALL and in 2018 for large B-cell lymphoma, generated $278 M in sales in 2019. Kymriah is price at \~$375 K for large B-cell lymphoma, and \~$475 M per year for ALL.

**Key Stock Drivers**

* **Compelling Clinical Data:** Both Iovance assets have demonstrated compelling data in heavily pretreated tumor types with limited alternate options and low bars for clinical efficacy.
* **Lucrative Expansion Opportunities:** There is substantial expansion potential outside of core indications of melanoma and cervical cancer, with ongoing phase 2 trials in NSCLC and HNSCC.
* **Entering Earlier Lines of Therapy:** Combination trials with Keytruda in melanoma, HNSCC, and NSCLC may allow lifleucel and LN-145 to enter earlier lines of therapy, unlocking additional value.
* **Strong Manufacturing Capacity:** Investment in large-scale manufacturing facilities and rapid therapy processing position Iovance to commercialize their therapies upon approval and quickly scale up to meet demand.
* **Likely Future Target of Acquisition:** Given what we have seen with large pharma seeking to enter the cell therapy space through acquisition (e.g., Gilead and Kite Pharma), there is a significant likelihood that Iovance gets bought by a major player. However, given the recent stock offering, this may not come until after commercialization.
* **Recent Stock Offerings Pricing Iovance at a 30% Discount:** Despite releasing positive data in melanoma during ASCO in late May, Iovance‚Äôs stock offerings raising \~$600 M have brought the price down from a \~$41 high to \~$31, providing opportunity to acquire shares at what is likely a discounted price.

**Potential Risks**

* **Cash Burn Rate:** Iovance is burning through cash at an accelerated rate, with cash burn increasing by \~62% in 2019. In 2019, Iovance spent \~$166 M and in 2020Q1 spent \~$60 M (2-fold that of 2019Q1), leaving \~$250 M on hand. This prompted a new stock offering in which Iovance closed on \~$600 M in cash to fuel the commercialization process. This should provide the cash necessary to achieve commercialization, but we will be keeping a close watch on rate of cash burn and how it coincides with advancement of commercialization efforts.
* **Operationalizing Commercialization Efforts:** Given that it looks like Iovance will commercialize on its own, building the sales force and other infrastructure necessary to meet sales goals may be challenging for a company with no prior experience. Not much information has been released around salesforce, so we will be watching for any updates here.
* **Incomplete NSCLC Data:** The phase 1 data for LN-145 in NSCLC looks promising, but comes with confounding factors, as select patients were given subsequent treatments combining two chemotherapies with IL-1. Additionally, ORR data was not released. The data coming out of larger trials in NSCLC will likely play a key role in Iovance valuation.
* **Future Competition from Major Players in Cell Therapy Space:** While Iovance has a head start on tackling solid tumors, CAR-T companies are looking toward this market with increasing vigor. If they can solve for the key challenge of inducing CAR-T to infiltrate the solid tumor (e.g., through engineering of immunosuppressive factors), these therapies could pose a threat to Iovance's market share in the future, though this is not likely to occur short-term.

And I've also read that if there are excess losses, they can reduce self-employment income or divided income up to $3,000 per year.

Does anyone know if a capital loss first reduces self-employment income, divided income, or either.  For low-income filers (roughly below $80k), there is about a 12% difference in these two options.

Please correct me where I'm wrong (I'm new to stocks).  Assume I bought a $100 stock and held it at least 61 days before the dividend (assume $10 dividend).  Also assume my total income is less than $80k and I have self-employment income.

On the ex-dividend date, I take the $10 dividend and sell my stock for $90.  I now have a $10 dividend that is taxed at 0% and a $10 loss.  If I can use that loss to reduce my self-employment income, it will net me another $1.20 in saved taxes.  If I have to use that loss to reduce my dividend income, it's a wash.

I can't seem to find the answer online (probably because there isn't a lot of money to be made here).  I'm more curious than anything.  Do any of you know?",,,,,,,,,,,,

I can't post pictures in this subreddit unfortunately however, the previous 9 years high for the DIX was 52.3%. Before the 200pt runup on the S&amp;P500 in may. Now, it's 52.5%. Now idea how this will play out but have fun looking at the documentation since I can't link pictures to it lol.

I like some of the ideas from this article but wonder if it is smarter to simply be short ETFs instead?  A cleaner way to introduce pure portfolio hedges.  At times, not sure I can stomach the stock-specific risk that comes from shorting.

This is one of the most popular ways to value a company and determine what it's actually worth, by projecting its future cashflows and discounting them back to present value. During the stream we'll do this step by step with a real company using their real financial statements so you can see how it's done and ask questions. 

As always I'll share my screen, stream it live on Twitch in the [#twitch_stream](https://discord.com/channels/516531977080406026/625750328108908564) channel and record it and upload it to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/lazyfa/) afterwards as well as share it in the [#archived_streams](https://discord.com/channels/516531977080406026/645651453788160040) channel in case you can't make it.

# **The stock market is running out of steam with reopening trades fading and economic data ‚Äòuneven‚Äô  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/the-stock-market-is-running-out-of-steam-with-reopening-trades-fading-and-economic-data-uneven.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.
*****
&gt; The stock market, so eager to put the entire blow from the pandemic behind it, is now coming to terms that a ‚ÄúV-shaped‚Äù recovery might be too rosy a scenario. 
*****
&gt; With recent spikes in coronavirus cases and fluctuations in the economic data, the market seems to be stuck in a range amid elevated volatility. Market analysts said investors should expect more turbulence ahead because the economic recovery is most likely to be bumpy.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market was priced for a continuation of improvement and I think that‚Äôs overstating what‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù said Brian Levitt, Invesco‚Äôs global market strategist. ‚ÄúWe are going to have episodes of cases rising. We are going to have a very slow and uneven improvement in the jobs market.‚Äù
*****
&gt; After soaring more than 40% from the March lows, the S&amp;P 500 turned sideways in the past two weeks, trading at similar levels to early June. The market, which used to turn a blind eye to disastrous news on the thinking that the economy had already bottomed, has become more vulnerable to negative economic headlines as the data begins to give a read on the shape of the recovery.
*****
&gt; Stocks came under pressure earlier this week after data showed weekly jobless claims rose more than expected last week, and the number stayed above 1 million for the 13th consecutive week. 
*****
&gt; And on the virus front, California, Texas, Florida and Arizona have reported an uptick in new infections and hospitalizations amid the reopening. Apple said Friday that it‚Äôs again closing some stores in Florida, North Carolina and Arizona due to the spikes in coronavirus cases, which sparked a sell-off in the market, especially among retail stocks.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe economy is going to need more help to bounce back in months to come,‚Äù said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. ‚ÄúFor now, volatility and choppy markets remain our base case as an uneven economic recovery likely unfolds.‚Äù
*****
&gt; # ‚ÄòRolling Ws‚Äô
&gt; The rally in those popular reopening trades ‚Äî airlines, cruise lines and hotels ‚Äî is seemingly losing steam. Shares of American Airlines and Delta posted their second straight weekly losses. So did Carnival, Norwegian Cruise and MGM Resorts. Those stocks were once the high-beta leaders of the market comeback as investors bet that a successful reopening would take hold. 
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAlthough the stock market was suggesting a V-shaped recovery, the more likely scenario is rolling Ws,‚Äù Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in a note.
*****
&gt; A similar market pattern happened during the financial crisis, pointed out by Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. After stocks rallied nearly 40% from the 2009 bottom, the market was range-bound for about seven weeks so the fundamentals could catch up, Colas noted.
*****
&gt; From a technical perspective, Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, is watching if the S&amp;P 500 can break above its recent high of 3,232 or drop below the 3,000 threshold or its 200-day moving average of 3,018 as of Friday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhichever way it breaks...should be an very important development in trying to determine how this critical juncture in the stock market will be resolved,‚Äù Maley said in a note.
*****
&gt; # Fed can‚Äôt prevent volatility
&gt; While the flattening virus curve played a big role in the market rebound, it‚Äôs no denying that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs unprecedented stimulus has been a key driver in lifting stocks from the coronavirus slump. The central bank unleashed another weapon in its arsenal this week, saying it will start buying individual corporate bonds.
*****
&gt; As comforting as it is to have the Fed‚Äôs support, the central bank can only do so much to ease investor fears.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe Fed can‚Äôt prevent the volatility we‚Äôre seeing in stocks,‚Äù Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, said in a note. ‚ÄúIt will likely take years for the economy to fully recover and there remain other uncertainties on the path ahead. As such, investors may continue to struggle with this mismatch between markets and the economy before seeing the case for new highs.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reminded investors again this week in his semiannual testimony before Congress that ‚Äúsignificant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Many on Wall Street have also warned that extended policy measures including injection of trillions of cheap money would lead to problems down the road such as hyperinflation.

# 100 Days

&gt; 100 days ago today on March 11th, the WHO made it official and declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Markets were already under a lot of pressure before the WHO declared the pandemic, but the 100 days since will probably go down as some of the craziest 100 days we'll ever experience, not only in the market but in general society as well. More than enough ink and pixels have been spent discussing the societal impact at large, so we'll spare you and just focus on the markets.

&gt; While much of the declines were already in the rearview mirror by the time the WHO made its announcement, equities still had a steep decline in the immediate aftermath. The large-cap Russell 1000, for example, fell another 19% to its March 23rd closing low, but after the rebound, the net change since the pandemic was officially declared &gt; has been a gain of 14.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Russell-1000.png))**

&gt; As impressive as the Russell 1000's gain has been in the face of the global pandemic, many stocks have done a lot better than that. The table below lists the 25 stocks in the index that have seen the biggest gains so far during this pandemic. Topping the list is Wayfair (W) which has rallied more than 350%. If there is one thing Americans must have realized while they were stuck at home under lockdown it was that they needed some new furniture! Behind Wayfair, two other stocks have more than tripled and both were beaten down stocks from the Energy sector that were trading at less than $2 per share on March 11th. A number of familiar names standout including Moderna (MRNA), Twilio (TWLO), DocuSign (DOCU), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Etsy (ETSY), but looking through the list, there's really a diverse group of names ranging from bombed-out stocks from the Energy sector (8 stocks), Consumer names (7 stocks), and the ever-popular software stocks from the Technology sector (6 stocks). It's definitely been a rocky road for the markets over the last 100 days, but for anyone who had these names in their portfolio, they aren't complaining.

# S&amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Remains Positive

&gt; Equity markets have become a bit wobbly in the last week or so, but breadth, in terms of large-cap industry groups, still remains pretty robust. Relative to their 50-DMAs, all 24 S&amp;P 500 industry groups still have rising 50-DMAs. When you consider the fact that the 50-day window spans the period going back to early April, a period encompassing most of what was one of the strongest 50-day rallies on record, the fact that every industry group has a rising 50-DMA isn't all that surprising.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Rising-50DMA.png))**

&gt; Even though all their 50-DMAs are rising, not every industry group is currently trading above its 50-DMA. While the reading briefly reached 100% in late May and early June, two industry groups have since pulled back below their 50-DMAs, putting the percentage at a still impressive 91.7%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Above-50-DMA.png))**

&gt; The table below summarizes industry group performance showing YTD performance, where each one is trading relative to its 50-DMA, as well as where the group is trading relative to its 52-week high.

&gt; As mentioned above, all but two groups (Drugs &amp; Biotech and Food &amp; Staples Retail) remain above their 50-DMAs, and another four are less than 2% above their 50-DMA. If Friday's sell-off deepens into next week, the percentage of industry groups above their 50-DMAs has the potential to quickly sink as low as 75%. Of the 22 industry groups that are above their 50-DMAs, Autos and Tech Hardware are the only two greater than 10% above.

&gt; On a YTD basis, the S&amp;P 500 is down less than 4%, but for the vast majority of industry groups, performance has been worse than that. Of the 24 groups shown, 16 are down more than 4% YTD, including eleven that are down over 10%. The worst performers of these losers include Energy, Banks, and Autos. While Energy gets most of the attention for being so weak, Banks are essentially down just as much! On the upside, just two industry groups are up over 10% (Retailers, which is basically Amazon, and Software &amp; Services). Retailing is also the one industry group that is within 1% of a 52-week high and one of seven that is within 4% of a 52-week high.

# Credit Market Reversals

&gt; We've noted in detail the massive reversals seen in global equities over the last three months, but outside of equities, we've also seen some other massive moves. One example is credit spreads between the yields of corporate and high yield bonds relative to Treasuries.

&gt; The top chart below shows the spread in yields between the B of A Corporate Index relative to Treasuries going back to 1997, and below that, we show the 50-day rate of change in the spread. Heading into the COVID-crash, spreads on corporate bonds were less than 100 basis points (bps), meaning the corporate bond index was yielding only 1 percentage point more than comparable Treasury yields. In the span of less than two months, though, spreads surged by more than 300 bps to over 400 bps. Not since the depths of the credit crisis in 2009 had we seen spreads widen out more than they did in March. Just as notable as the level is the fact that the speed with which spreads widened during the COVID-crash was similar to the pace during the credit crisis.

&gt; While spreads were quick to spike during both crises, they narrowed nearly as fast both times. Going back to 1997, the most corporate spreads have ever narrowed over a 50-day period was in June 2009. Coming in at a close second place, though, the 50-day period ending in early June was nearly as extreme.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-Corporates.png))**

&gt; Similar to spreads on corporate bonds, the movement in spreads on high yield (junk) credit has been nearly as extreme. While spreads on the B of A High Yield Master Index widened out by only half as much during the COVID-crash as they did during the Financial Crisis, the 50-day move ending in late March was easily more extreme than any other period outside of the credit crisis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-High-Yield.png))**

&gt; A shown in both charts above, the only time both corporate and high yield spreads narrowed by an amount anywhere close to the amount they narrowed from late March through early June was back in early June of 2009. The chart below of the S&amp;P 500 shows that point from the perspective of the S&amp;P 500. That period in June 2009 was right in the early stages of what turned out to be a multi-year bull market. Given the similar tightening in the credit market now versus back then, should we assume a similar move for equities going forward?

&gt; After the last five months, we'll be the first to say that anything is possible. However, while there are plenty of similarities between the moves in credit markets over the last three months versus the first half of 2009, there are also important distinctions. The most important of these has to do with where the S&amp;P 500 is trading right now. The second chart below shows the historical levels the S&amp;P 500 has traded at relative to its all-time high. Even after the initial narrowing of credit spreads from March through early June 2009, the S&amp;P 500 was still more than 40% off its all-time highs, and therefore still had a lot of climbing to do to get out of the hole. Back in June 2009, to get back to its all-time high from October 2007, the S&amp;P 500 still had to rally another 75%. Today, it's a much different picture as the S&amp;P 500 is already within 10% of its February 2020 all-time high. Could we be in the earlier stages of what turns out to be another long-term bull market? Sure. Will the magnitude of the gains be anything like the gains early on in the bull market that began in 2009? It's unlikely.

# The Very Slow Recovery In Economic Activity Is Continuing

&gt; As economies around the country slowly recover from COVID-19 and reopenings proceed, economic activity is slowly recovering. For the hardest-hit sectors, though, the recovery is only inching forward. Security checkpoint volumes at US airports are still down 80% YoY, and the trend of improvement is only set to return travel activity to 50% of 2019 levels in September.

&gt; For restaurants, OpenTable data shows covers down by two-thirds from last year, though some of that is because many restaurants remain closed. Among reopened establishments, the number of seated customers are still down almost 40% YoY. About half of restaurants remain closed per the OpenTable data. We discussed this chart and other retail enthusiasm indicators in last night's Closer report, which is available to Bespoke Institutional members.

# Leading Indicators Turn Positive

&gt; Yesterday, The Conference Board released last month‚Äôs reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, which showed a month-over-month increase of 2.8%. As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the return to positive territory follows three straight months of negative monthly growth.

&gt; ‚ÄùWe noted that the pace of the LEI‚Äôs deterioration slowed in the April report, potentially suggesting a bottom forming in the US economy,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs print was one of several positive economic data surprises we‚Äôve observed recently, bolstering our optimistic view for economic growth in the second half of the year.‚Äù

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.19.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While the economy still has a ways to go in order to recover from the damage of the prior three months, the composition of May‚Äôs LEI advance encourages us. We noted a disconnect in April‚Äôs readout in which the financial market indicators tended to be net positive contributors while the ‚Äúreal economy‚Äù indicators detracted. May‚Äôs release saw a reversal of that trend whereby the economic subindexes played catch-up. Seven of the 10 components were positive contributors led by an improvement in average weekly initial unemployment claims, average weekly manufacturing hours, and building permits. The three negative contributors were the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) New Orders Index, average consumer expectations for business conditions, and the Leading Credit Index.

&gt; The most recent LEI release reinforces our view that an economic bottom is likely behind us. Workers starting to return to jobs that they were unable to do remotely had material effects on May‚Äôs readout, and if that trend continues, a stock market trading at stretched valuations would have a stronger foundation under it.

# 3 Charts That Have Our Attention

&gt; Stocks have shaken off the 5.9% S&amp;P 500 Index drop last Thursday by gaining three days in a row before yesterday‚Äôs modest weakness. While researching and reading this week, three charts stood out that tell us quite a good deal about how investors have reacted during this volatile market and what could be next.

&gt; ‚ÄúIncredibly, we saw nearly a third of all investors over 65 years old sell their full equity holdings,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWith stocks now back near highs, this is yet another reason to have a plan in place before trouble comes, as making decisions when under duress can lead to the exact wrong decision.‚Äù

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, according to data from Fidelity Investments, nearly 18% of all investors sold their full equity holdings between February and May, while a much higher percentage that were closer to retirement (or in retirement) sold. Some might have bought back in, but odds are that many are feeling quite upset with the record bounce back in stocks here.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.18.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Along these same lines, investors have recently moved to cash at a record pace. In fact, there is now nearly $5 trillion in money market funds, almost twice the levels we saw this time only five years ago. Also, the past three months saw the largest three-month change ever, as investors ran to the safety of cash. If you were looking for a reason stocks could continue to go higher over the longer term, there really is a lot of cash on the sidelines right now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.18.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we noted last week that the extreme overbought nature of stocks here is actually consistent with the start of a new bull run, not a bear market bounce, or the end of a bull market. Adding to this, the spread between the number of stocks above their 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average was near the highest level ever. Think about it; with the 45% bounce in the S&amp;P 500, many stocks were above their 50-day moving average, but not nearly as many were above their 200-day moving average. So from a longer-term perspective, there could still be gains to be had.

&gt; Sure enough, looking at other times that had wide spreads, they took place near the start of major bull markets. Near-term the potential is there for a well-deserved pullback, but going out 6 to 12 months, stocks have consistently outperformed.

# Election Year July Performance Tepid

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. Two ‚Äúhot‚Äù Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 and 2018 have boosted July‚Äôs average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a ‚Äúsummer rally‚Äù, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2020).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ‚Äôs worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and some strength towards the end.

Similar to Virgin Galactic existing as the only public space tourism company, Beyond Meat is the only public company solely producing plant-based meat alternatives. This has multiple major implications. Since going public, Beyond Meat has seen considerable price appreciation simply because other meatless competitors, like Kellogg, Kraft Heinz, and Tyson aren't solely devoted to producing plant-based meat alternatives, thus BYND is seen as a pure play in the sustainable food space. Because of this favorable positioning, BYND benefits from multiple types of catalysts that inflate their stock price.

1. Because of the limited environment for investing in plant-based meat producers (i.e. the only public one), Beyond Meat is inherently the go-to purchase for investors, which artificially drives up stock price. As competitors like Impossible Burger going public, and public competitors like Tyson, Kellogg, and Kraft Heinz grow their R&amp;D and production of plant-based products, BYND loses this unique investment advantage and will see less price appreciation as a result.
2. Because of the limited environment for investing in plant-based meat alternatives (and point #1), Beyond Meat's share price irrationally appreciates when the general industry receives favorable news. Similar to point #1, as the number of investment vehicles for this industry grow in number, the upside of favorable industry developments weakens.

Considering #1 and #2, even if Beyond is able to gain [mainstream adoption](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/beyond-meats-stock-is-wildly-overpriced-even-if-business-expands-perfectly-2020-05-08) as a permanent alternative to meat over the next few years, increasing players in the space will average out the ""hype"" that has driven this inflated stock price. With an average P/E ratio of 25 among Consumer Defensive companies, Beyond's $10 billion dollar valuation and F/PE of 267 only has room to decrease, as juggernaut competitors have greater cash flow to fund development and expansion of meat alternatives.

I would monitor the sector for catalysts (to the downside) in events like IPOs, significant developments in the sales/profitability of publicly traded competitors' plant-based meat sales, and new competitors altogether.",self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'HUq1HVFqgrH5TnfrFT7YTGcw_WnJY0v5CJwIMMJJD4Q', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2gBz_BQb-zX2abS71CBvzd0MTCXEH00dTGzZ0bQ7DBA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8d9d5bab8025c1e4cfdb0a3d0d030bde82d471c', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2gBz_BQb-zX2abS71CBvzd0MTCXEH00dTGzZ0bQ7DBA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=492bca608785bcb54bee325cf0b9aa97f2bb1011', 'width': 216}, {'height': 179, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2gBz_BQb-zX2abS71CBvzd0MTCXEH00dTGzZ0bQ7DBA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e33f1eb8bc61e21cca080e7ff5b714a2d4f152c', 'width': 320}, {'height': 359, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2gBz_BQb-zX2abS71CBvzd0MTCXEH00dTGzZ0bQ7DBA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91e807ef0a49ec83211f3c72df8aa4c1b94538ea', 'width': 640}, {'height': 539, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2gBz_BQb-zX2abS71CBvzd0MTCXEH00dTGzZ0bQ7DBA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2528affd92b2ab46bed917ea6b47cbe39f86d0b4', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2gBz_BQb-zX2abS71CBvzd0MTCXEH00dTGzZ0bQ7DBA.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e07318d0efece7ba918d75e539111821a71e7a09', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 742, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2gBz_BQb-zX2abS71CBvzd0MTCXEH00dTGzZ0bQ7DBA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=616f2f3a905ea43e0d3efd5fc65435c686f3d320', 'width': 1320}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

So the futures acts as a precursor for price action but the underlying S&amp;P 500 isn't abstract,  it's a basket of 500 tangible stocks.   So given that the S&amp;P tracks 500 stocks,  how does the futures market change the value of the index?

It's common to read ""S&amp;P futures were up 150 points overnight which is expected to cause a 80 point jump at open"" (sample numbers). It's also rarely a 1:1 correlation.    Also I'm unsure if it's limited to having an overnight/opening impact as the eMini for example trades at the same time the NYSE/Nasdaq underlying shares are also trading.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Me and my two brothers  (18-20yrs, UK) have recently got into investing in the past few months...

We have inherited about ¬£30,000 each which we plan to cost-average into a long-term dividend growth portfolio, starting off mainly with ETFs/bonds. 

We‚Äôve noticed that there seem to be more promising American companies in terms of dividends, however we‚Äôre wondering whether or not it would be a good idea to invest in American companies with the current rate of exchange between the $ and ¬£ which could mean we lose a bit of money over the long term. 

The platform we‚Äôre using is Trading212

But then there's the thing with surplus. If a company retained this money and instead of paying it out to shareholders, stacked it up somewhere, the stock price wouldn't decrease.
Also reinvesting doesn't always make sense  when the company is already established.

* Earnings are forecast to grow 66.15% per year

* Revenue is forecast to grow 29% per year

* Tencent Holdings Limited holds 24% of the company. Insiders hold 17% while Institutional investors hold 50%

* Expected to be profitable in 2022

* Short term assets of 4 billion and short term liabilities of 2.4 billion. Long term assets of 1.18 billion and long term liabilities of 1.8 billion

* Has enough cash to be sustainable for 3 years

&gt;Sea can be seen as a gateway to the Southeast Asian consumer, a fast-growing population with rising incomes that could drive enormous value creation in the coming years. On a sum-of-parts basis, I believe the current valuation can be justified by the more established but still fast-growing e-commerce and gaming businesses, while optionality around digital banking, streaming, and payments could drive additional upside.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I held through and just two weeks ago, airlines all of sudden skyrocketed. In two days i more than doubled my portfolio.

I didn't take profit. In retroaspect it's kinda dumb because i pretty much lost almost all the easy profits. It was kinda life changing money and Im pretty much to pre-skyrocket level this week. 

But airlines will pump again, soon. TSA level is already 21%. People are already tired of the covid19 bullshit. Ignore the reddit soyboys. They dont represent the majority. July is coming in and airlines such as AAL predict domestic will be back at 50%. 

Once it comes true and it will, airlines will skyrocket again. Today is likely the last day of airlines still being at depressed level. Next week it gonna take off. 

Once my portfolio value goes back to the crazy level i had 2 weeks ago i'm not even gonna take profit. Because last time the decline happened because airlines rose too fast, and the fact the media started to hype up muuuuhhhh second wave and many retail idiots got scared. While this time, the rally will be SUSTAINED, because it will be based on actual, real data and no more weak hands any more since they all got flushed out after the first pump. The only way to go from this point is up. I predict 100% increase in major legacy airlines such as AAL UAL and DAL before year end, and very likely 30% next week across the sector, so don't miss out. 

Hold strong. 30% next week, 50% end of July, 100% end of year. If you're scared, invest in JETS to get exposure while reducing risk. And also invest in Brazilian airlines such as AZUL and GOL since brazil is very reliant on air travel and these stocks gonna come back.",,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;III.C. The Warehouse-Lending Process shows the two stages of the warehouse-lending process. In the initial stage, shown on the left side, the mortgage borrower is approved for a mortgage from the nonbank originator, who funds the mortgage using a draw from a line of credit provided by a warehouse lender. Typically, the warehouse lender will only fund about 95 percent of the mortgage balance, so that the nonbank originator has some skin in the game for each loan. The collateral on the loan is the mortgage, and the nonbank in turn transfers the mortgage to the warehouse lender to collateralize the draw on its line of credit. **Since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, mortgage-collateralized warehouse lending has been eligible for accounting and legal treatment as repurchase agreements (repos).**

&amp;#x200B;

Next, turn to page 16: **III.D. Vulnerabilities of Warehouse Funding,** to keep it simple its the equavlant to adding stop loss to every warehouse line of credit (which are used to fund mortgages). Since the margin call is on the loan for the mortgage instead of the mortgage itself, we don't see forclosures yet, but instead the margin call money is funded by the repo. Shawdow banks take the margin call. They pay the call via repo loan and pay that back via bonds, hence why the fed is buying those, junk bonds to be specific

&gt;Ginnie Mae servicers can only obtain unsecured financing, such as **unsecured corporate bonds**, to cover their advances. The rates on this financing are high, especially because many nonbanks have highyield credit ratings.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** most high risk mortgages(over 50% of total mortgages) that a bank wouldn't lend, was lent by shadow banks via a link of credit from the banks. Banks have tight stop losses set on these and have been issuing margin calls on tons of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Then it gets me thinking that veteran traders and market makers are probably sending prices up when Robinhood traders cannot make trades. 

It seems to be very unfortunate that RH opens at 9 and closes at 6 and much of the recent volatility and gapping up or down has been outside of these hours

I have 20 sometbing accounts in every broker out there and my RH account (guess what!!!!) has been the least profitable for the year

My Merrill, E*TRADE and thinkorswim have been rich in returns because of extended trading opportunities

It's Friday and futures are higher ahead of the opening. Friday's have a tendency to see gains as people are typically more optimistic going into the weekend.

However, with cases of the coronavirus on the rise across the country, many people may be hesitant to hold a position over the week.

With markets at a key point of resistance, I think we will see some selling to start. It could get choppy after that.

**WATCHLIST:**

**NVFY** is a low float, resistance at $2.70

**NEON** is a low float, watching for a continuation from yesterday

**BYFC** is a low float, support at $3, resistance at $5

**WRTC** is a low float, resistance at $10

**OTLK** is a lowish float, resistance at $1.40

**GRWG** is a lowish float, resistance at $7.82

**NLS** is a lowish float, support at $7.80

**UBX** is on watch for a setup above $9.50. Possible short squeeze being orchestrated by pumpers.

I have been day trading for quite sometime now, and when I first begun I had the hardest time setting up screeners/scanners. I tried using a few free products out there but nothing really caught my attention, also they had a steep learning curve. I also did not want to pay $100's of dollars for Trade-Ideas and similar ""high quality"" platforms.

Over the past few months I have been working on a desktop app that has pre-made screeners/scanners that are meant for the newbies, I have tested the application with both new traders and seasoned traders, and the feedback has been great!

I would like to invite you to sign up and try it out once it releases. It will be 100% Free and available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

After reading more about other countries having sovereign wealth funds(its mainly investments in companies of other countries). I dont think its a bad idea anymore. For example Saudi Arabia has one of the largest investment funds in the world at 400 billion $. They are buying huge % of various companies in all sorts of industries in dozens of different countries. What else are the Saudi‚Äôs gonna invest their dwindling oil revenues in? More supertall skyscrapers at sea level that will be under water in 30 years? 

India recently stopped Chinese companies from buying distressed Indian tech companies. That is the right move to protect the country from being bought up by China. Literally the future of India owned by China. Same is happening here with the govt supporting the market. Should the US govt allow the SP500 to crash even lower so the Saudis and others can scoop up everything at a discount?

But since were printing trillions in new dollars to help the rich why not help all of us this time. I propose all student loan debt be forgiven. Also SPY shares should be given to citizens at birth to be held in accounts so dividends are paid out to you over your lifetime and youre not allowed to just sell it all whenever you want. You‚Äôd be allowed to sell only a bit of it every 10 years but it has to last to your retirement. Its purpose is were all invested in the future of our country. And its time for at least $2000 monthly universal basic income and universal healthcare like every other fucking developed country has.
As weve seen money and wealth is an illusion and can be magically printed when the rich need help. Its time to spread the illusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bancorp ($CARV) soared to as high as $21 (+775%) in the morning and closed +248%, one must ask why the similar, Broadway Financial Corp ($BFYC) in LA, which also serves the African-American community hadn\'t likewise seen such gains (yet).\n\nOn Tuesday, BYFC was as low as $1.23-- yesterday it was as high as $2.32, before settling at $1.69 (+18%) at close. At the end of AH trading, it suddenly shot up to $3 -- yet in pre-market trading, it was pushed back down to $2, before retail traders would even have the ability to get into it. \n\nWhy is it being kept down? Let\'s follow the breadcrumbs back to one person, with a financial interest in keeping BYFC depressed. \n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nBroadway Federal Bank was founded in 1946 by early black civil-rights leaders, including businessman and dentist [H. Claude Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Claude_Hudson) and famed architect [Paul R. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Williams), specifically to offer banking services to the underserved minorities in LA. \n\nIt\'s a federally chartered S&amp;L bank, but shockingly, the last traditionally African-American community bank headquartered on the West coast.\n\nSince going public in 1995, of course, it is no longer considered ""black-owned"" since anyone can buy shares -- but its [explicit mission](https://www.broadwayfederalbank.com/history) is ""to serve the real estate, financial and business needs of customers in underserved urban communities.""\n\nThe current CEO is [Wayne-Kent Bradshaw](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-himi-bradshaw-20180727-story.html), who took over in 2009. Since then, he has steadily grown the balance sheet.\n\nFinancials:\n* 3Q 2019, the assets were $414.6M;\n* by 4Q 2019 they were $442M; \n* and by 1Q20 hit $506M. \n\nAt the same time, deposits have increased: from $286M last year to $333M last quarter.\n\nBradshaw has done this by [refocusing attention on expanding the portfolio of loans](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/how-the-wests-only-black-bank-has-evolved/the-evolution-of-the-wests-only-black-bank) for ""Class C"" multifamily units -- lower-cost housing in the range of $500M to $2.5M, which tends to be below what bigger banks will touch. According to Bradshaw, however, ‚ÄúOur average borrower probably has a net worth of $7 million.‚Äù\n\n**Barbarians at the Gates**\n\nAll this unfortunately hasn\'t been reflected in the value of the stock price-- which has under 20M shares outstanding. So at its low point of the year, $1.04, it had a market cap of barely $20M. That would be a cheap price to pay for a company that holds half a billion dollars in assets and over $300M in deposits.\n\nThis hasn\'t escaped the notice of outside parties, those who would try to buy out the bank entirely, taking it private, to get a taste of those sweet, sweet assets.\n\nIn answer to that threat, in September 2019, the Board of Directors enacted a ""[Shareholder\'s Rights Plan](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190911005251/en/Broadway-Financial-Corporation-Announces-Adoption-Stockholder-Rights)"" (AKA ""poison pill"") which would give additional voting rights to existing shareholders if anyone attempted to acquire over 10% of the company -- as a way to prevent such a takeover.\n\nBut one such person is trying: Steven Sugarman, former CEO of Banc Of California-- who [resigned in 2017 under dubious circumstances](https://www.ocregister.com/2017/01/24/banc-of-california-ceo-resigns-following-sec-probe/), which included a criminal investigation. \n\nJust after losing his CEO gig, Sugarman founded ""The Capital Corps"" as his own personal financial fiefdom, and then acquired lender Commerce Home Mortgage as a subsidiary.\n\n(It might also be worth mentioning that Sugarman is-- shall we say-- *not* black, and has no personal interest or connection to the African-American community.)\n\nIn February, through his companies, [Sugarman acquired a ton of BYFC](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-030009/) -- 9.66% or 1.8M shares -- just under the poison pill threshold. **This made him the largest single shareholder in the company.**\n\nHe did so through Commerce Home Mortgage, and immediately sent a letter to the Board of Broadway Federal, saying that they wanted to buy the company, demanding a meeting and to drop the whole poison pill thing.\n\nCEO Bradshaw wrote back a [neutrally worded letter](https://www.broadwayfederalbank.com/Media/BroadwayFed/pdf/Financial%20Highlights/Broadway%20Financial%20Corporation_8-K%20Feb.%2012,%202020%20[As-filed].pdf) to the effect of ""we\'ll get back to you on that.""\n\n**OH NO YOU DIDN\'T**\n\nSugarman didn\'t like the sound of that -- and had his underlings [draft a stern reply with threats of litigation](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001171/000119312520041863/d574750dex991.htm) which further went into how much Broadway sucks, and how Broadway\'s board should listen to them and do everything they said... or else.\n\nOn April 13, the Capital Corps tried to [float an unsolicited offer to buy out the bank](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001171/000119312520106014/d882933dex991.htm)... for $1.75 or $48M, which they called a ""premium of approximately 33% to the 30-Day average closing price of the Company‚Äôs common stock.""\n\nNaturally, the [Board rejected this tender](https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-capital-corps-llc-says-on-may-8-de/brief-capital-corps-llc-says-on-may-8-delivered-letter-to-broadway-financials-board-idUSFWN2CQ19E), which represented less than a tenth of the assets held by the bank. \n\nBut Sugarman wasn\'t done. He decided he was going to run his own candidates for the board, and have a proxy fight, thus try to take over the company from within.\n\nOnly *OPPS!* apparently [Commerce Home Mortgage wasn\'t a shareholder on record as of May 1](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200615005803/en/Broadway-Financial-Corporation-Files-Supplement-Proxy-Statement), and thus, Commerce ""is not eligible under Broadway‚Äôs bylaws to nominate a candidate for election to Broadway‚Äôs board of directors.""\n\nSo that\'s where things stand right now -- and the annual shareholders\' meeting is just one week away.\n\n**Manipulation**\n\nRemember that Sugarman had control of over 1.8M shares. It would be in his company\'s interest to continue to depress BYFC\'s stock price to at or below its tendered amount -- otherwise, they may not be able to buy it outright.\n\nCertainly, they could no longer claim to be giving it a ""fair valuation"" if the stock was now twice or more what it had been when they floated their offer just a few months ago.\n\nThus, it would be trivial for them to sell small amounts into the market, keeping the price artificially low.\n\nHowever, this may not last much longer: if the price keeps going up (through pumping or retail interest), Sugarman will have no recourse but to give up his takeover attempts, and sell his holdings (and take the profits!)\n\n**tl;dr: Stock price of $BYFC being pushed down as part of a hostile takeover, although may be fought off by buyers**', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a day when NY&amp;#39;s historically black-centric Carver Bancorp ($CARV) soared to as high as $21 (+775%) in the morning and closed +248%, one must ask why the similar, Broadway Financial Corp ($BFYC) in LA, which also serves the African-American community hadn&amp;#39;t likewise seen such gains (yet).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, BYFC was as low as $1.23-- yesterday it was as high as $2.32, before settling at $1.69 (+18%) at close. At the end of AH trading, it suddenly shot up to $3 -- yet in pre-market trading, it was pushed back down to $2, before retail traders would even have the ability to get into it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is it being kept down? Let&amp;#39;s follow the breadcrumbs back to one person, with a financial interest in keeping BYFC depressed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Broadway Federal Bank was founded in 1946 by early black civil-rights leaders, including businessman and dentist &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Claude_Hudson""&gt;H. Claude Hudson&lt;/a&gt; and famed architect &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Williams""&gt;Paul R. Williams&lt;/a&gt;, specifically to offer banking services to the underserved minorities in LA. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a federally chartered S&amp;amp;L bank, but shockingly, the last traditionally African-American community bank headquartered on the West coast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since going public in 1995, of course, it is no longer considered &amp;quot;black-owned&amp;quot; since anyone can buy shares -- but its &lt;a href=""https://www.broadwayfederalbank.com/history""&gt;explicit mission&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;quot;to serve the real estate, financial and business needs of customers in underserved urban communities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The current CEO is &lt;a href=""https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-himi-bradshaw-20180727-story.html""&gt;Wayne-Kent Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;, who took over in 2009. Since then, he has steadily grown the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Financials:\n* 3Q 2019, the assets were $414.6M;\n* by 4Q 2019 they were $442M; \n* and by 1Q20 hit $506M. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, deposits have increased: from $286M last year to $333M last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bradshaw has done this by &lt;a href=""https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/how-the-wests-only-black-bank-has-evolved/the-evolution-of-the-wests-only-black-bank""&gt;refocusing attention on expanding the portfolio of loans&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;quot;Class C&amp;quot; multifamily units -- lower-cost housing in the range of $500M to $2.5M, which tends to be below what bigger banks will touch. According to Bradshaw, however, ‚ÄúOur average borrower probably has a net worth of $7 million.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbarians at the Gates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this unfortunately hasn&amp;#39;t been reflected in the value of the stock price-- which has under 20M shares outstanding. So at its low point of the year, $1.04, it had a market cap of barely $20M. That would be a cheap price to pay for a company that holds half a billion dollars in assets and over $300M in deposits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This hasn&amp;#39;t escaped the notice of outside parties, those who would try to buy out the bank entirely, taking it private, to get a taste of those sweet, sweet assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In answer to that threat, in September 2019, the Board of Directors enacted a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190911005251/en/Broadway-Financial-Corporation-Announces-Adoption-Stockholder-Rights""&gt;Shareholder&amp;#39;s Rights Plan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; (AKA &amp;quot;poison pill&amp;quot;) which would give additional voting rights to existing shareholders if anyone attempted to acquire over 10% of the company -- as a way to prevent such a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one such person is trying: Steven Sugarman, former CEO of Banc Of California-- who &lt;a href=""https://www.ocregister.com/2017/01/24/banc-of-california-ceo-resigns-following-sec-probe/""&gt;resigned in 2017 under dubious circumstances&lt;/a&gt;, which included a criminal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just after losing his CEO gig, Sugarman founded &amp;quot;The Capital Corps&amp;quot; as his own personal financial fiefdom, and then acquired lender Commerce Home Mortgage as a subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(It might also be worth mentioning that Sugarman is-- shall we say-- &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; black, and has no personal interest or connection to the African-American community.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In February, through his companies, &lt;a href=""https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-030009/""&gt;Sugarman acquired a ton of BYFC&lt;/a&gt; -- 9.66% or 1.8M shares -- just under the poison pill threshold. &lt;strong&gt;This made him the largest single shareholder in the company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did so through Commerce Home Mortgage, and immediately sent a letter to the Board of Broadway Federal, saying that they wanted to buy the company, demanding a meeting and to drop the whole poison pill thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CEO Bradshaw wrote back a &lt;a href=""https://www.broadwayfederalbank.com/Media/BroadwayFed/pdf/Financial%20Highlights/Broadway%20Financial%20Corporation_8-K%20Feb.%2012,%202020%20%5BAs-filed%5D.pdf""&gt;neutrally worded letter&lt;/a&gt; to the effect of &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ll get back to you on that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OH NO YOU DIDN&amp;#39;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sugarman didn&amp;#39;t like the sound of that -- and had his underlings &lt;a href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001171/000119312520041863/d574750dex991.htm""&gt;draft a stern reply with threats of litigation&lt;/a&gt; which further went into how much Broadway sucks, and how Broadway&amp;#39;s board should listen to them and do everything they said... or else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On April 13, the Capital Corps tried to &lt;a href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001171/000119312520106014/d882933dex991.htm""&gt;float an unsolicited offer to buy out the bank&lt;/a&gt;... for $1.75 or $48M, which they called a &amp;quot;premium of approximately 33% to the 30-Day average closing price of the Company‚Äôs common stock.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the &lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-capital-corps-llc-says-on-may-8-de/brief-capital-corps-llc-says-on-may-8-delivered-letter-to-broadway-financials-board-idUSFWN2CQ19E""&gt;Board rejected this tender&lt;/a&gt;, which represented less than a tenth of the assets held by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Sugarman wasn&amp;#39;t done.

I think RL is pretty cheap right now ($74) assuming it will bounce back to 100+ within possibly the end of this year. Before the recent crash, it spiked at $90 so I don‚Äôt see how it won‚Äôt get back to somewhere near that level again once the next big couple of green days come or at least later on when things normalize. I also imagine stocks that have bounced back already will be affected less by news of a vaccine than stocks that haven‚Äôt recovered yet meaning vaccine news should make RL surge more than for instance APPL. RL has been up and down a lot over the past five years or so and my plan is to sell once it makes it back up above that $100 price point again. RL is going more digital and is expanding in Asia and in Europe. 

HM is not quite as cheap but I think it may come out stronger after the pandemic than before. HM knows how to make a profit off of discounted items and everything in the clothing industry is going to be discounted for quite some time because products have piled up due to shutdowns and they need to make room for next season. It‚Äôs possible people will want to save a little money more than usually and shop at stores like HM and Primark more so than premium clothes like for instance Ralph Lauren. HM is also working intensely on going more digital and I see future growth there. 

One final important point is I find it very unlikely either of these will go bankrupt. 

What are your thoughts on these stocks? 

I‚Äôve also considered Guess (GES) and Nordstrom (JWN). I think they offer bigger potential gains than HM and RL but they are also riskier and would be affected more by a second wave of Covid 19.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I tried posting this on the Robinhood sub but someone else already posted it and was removed by the sub's mods. I wonder why. 

I've also experienced quite a handful of bugs using Robinhood, or at least when I still used the app. Just off the top of my head I can remember a countless amount of UI bugs that prevented me from selling or buying a stock during early market hours. 

There were also bugs that delayed real prices of a stock by several minutes, sometimes up to half an hour forcing me to use other sources with more accurate price information like Google Finance or TD to submit properly priced orders. 

Another frustrating bug I remember is the instant deposit almost never working in a timely fashion. It was always late by several days. 

The final straw when I outright transferred all my money and deleted the app was about 3 years ago when Robinhood's services were down for an ENTIRE HOUR while I was daytrading $BABA a couple days after an earnings beat. I lost about $600 in that hour, but it could have been much, much worse. 

The bug this young investor experienced is not something rare or uncommon with Robinhood. More people need to understand this company has a long history of corrupt support, terrible servers and networks, and countless UI bugs. Given this tragic news, don't make the same mistake.

# Are we in a stock market bubble?

The best indicator of whether or not the stock market is in a bubble can be seen in this chart. **Charts don't lie.**

[https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/)

This chart shows you the **market cap to gdp ratio**.  It's basically a chart that shows how overpriced stocks are compared to  the actual economy. When stocks reach above 1 then it's in bubble  territory. US stocks are currently at **1.478**. At the peak of the dotcom bubble that number reached **1.4**. At the peak of the housing market bubble it peaked at **1.061**.

# Market sentiment during peak of bubble

At  the peak of a bubble you start noticing a lot of people that have  gotten rich from the stock market. People are buying stocks on margin  thinking that the Fed will always save the day. It is very easy to just  buy and walk away and you see your portfolio double and triple. You see a  lot of hysteria in the market as you see now. This happened during the  peak of the dotcom bubble and the housing bubble. People were buying  tech stocks with $0 in revenue thinking they would be the next Google.  They didn't care the company wasn't making any money and thought the  stocks would just keep going up. FOMO (fear of missing out) is common  during these times. A lot of new traders hop in when they see all their  friends getting rich. During the housing crisis people with low income  jobs could easily get three mortgages to buy big houses thinking they  would go up forever. As we all know now, they don't go up forever.  Today, we see companies like Nikola with $0 in revenue skyrocket because  a lot of speculators are jumping in. But who knows, maybe they will  become the next Tesla. I personally would avoid it. This article  explains market sentiment during a bubble well. I think we are in the  ""return to normal"" stage where a lot of people were buying the dip.

# How to invest during a bubble

Bargains  are not easy to find during a bubble but if you do enough research you  can find them. Even during the past recessions, if you were able to find  companies that were a bargain, you still would've made money. I thought  airlines were a bargain when they hit rock bottom but apparently  Buffett had second thoughts. **Buffett never sells his stocks**.  When you see him selling stocks in a company, that means there are  serious problems with the company. He knows a lot more about companies  than most of us do. The table below is from Bridgewater Associates. They  did a study on a macroeconomic level on the impact of COVID-19 on the  economy.

[https://imgur.com/xkDBwVC](https://imgur.com/xkDBwVC)

According  to this table if the unemployment rate is at 10% you can expect an 85%  drop in earnings for the airline industry. Currently the unemployment  rate is 13.3%. Currently AAL stock is at $16. If you do the math and  calculate the potential earnings drop, the price of AAL isn't considered  a bargain unless it is less than $5. Buffett sold AAL at $11 and he is  right.

One industry that took a  huge hit but Buffett still held onto were oil stocks. Oil stocks hit  rock bottom during the recent crash due to oil prices dropping. I think  oil companies could potentially be a bargain right now.

Also, with all the money printing being done by the fed, gold is looking more and more attractive.

# How to invest like Warren Buffett

Buffett's strategy is actually very simple. **Buy when cheap**.  Even if you have to wait 20 years for it to become cheap. You need the  patience like him in order to become a legendary investor. He follows  the market cap to gdp chart closely. When the market goes through a  recession and the number drops down to below 0.8, watch him go on a  buying spree while everyone else is crying. He does this during every  recession. He rarely buys when valuations are high like now.

# Are recessions bad?

Recessions  tend to happen every 10-20 years in a healthy economy. Most people  think recessions are bad but actually they are healthy for an economy.  Economies like the US go through debt cycles. Debt goes down during  these recessions and the economy emerges more efficient and it is better  for the consumer since prices drop. We are currently at the very end of  this current debt cycle and you are noticing the signs of it. Wealth  gap increases and social unrest increases. Interest rates are at 0%. A  new power (China) emerges and contests the current power (USA). Fed is  constantly printing money to keep the stock market from falling. Rich  get richer and poor get poorer. A deleveraging process (recession or  depression) usually fixes a lot of this. (source: Big Debt Crisis by Ray  Dalio)

# Where is the stock market going in the short term?

Nobody  knows the answer to this. I see a small upside potential but a large  downside potential. Which direction it will go in the short term is  anybody's guess. One thing I've noticed is Trump is trying very very  hard to inflate the stock market bubble. He knows he is not getting  re-elected if the stock market crashes now. He is pressuring the Fed to  constantly print money and he's spending helicopter money like a madman  trying to prop up the stock market. This may be good for stocks in the  short term but has serious consequences for the long term, since the  already huge bubble becomes even bigger. Also, during a deleveraging  process a lot of high debt companies declare bankruptcy. This is when  the Fed needs to step in and save the essential businesses. You can't  let large essential companies fail, since that might take down the  entire US economy. When the auto industry failed in 2008, it took down  entire cities along with them. All this spending that the Fed is doing  now worries me. They might run out of ammunition when they really need  it. This next recession might be very very bad.",self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'GP3P025RUXaNQtDSRQNYhxuRIOkbmZHP0PG4MV8JkWw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 112, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FY6knmnN5mgRQTtAHiempkY84uzUVxibESf_P_jxXZ0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=809708a58f4f47ab11ff2637fc1ef4521f013c0a', 'width': 108}, {'height': 224, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FY6knmnN5mgRQTtAHiempkY84uzUVxibESf_P_jxXZ0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4a49d3ad2392368b5d0b6c0b1fb5adbc6e9f51c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 332, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FY6knmnN5mgRQTtAHiempkY84uzUVxibESf_P_jxXZ0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd43750dbbba5b531d400ba924e9b4370272c0c', 'width': 320}, {'height': 664, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FY6knmnN5mgRQTtAHiempkY84uzUVxibESf_P_jxXZ0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa4600d85dbfe096326db2d1f558fb7018174d42', 'width': 640}, {'height': 997, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FY6knmnN5mgRQTtAHiempkY84uzUVxibESf_P_jxXZ0.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f57b8a0caf5c37a6510f2c99f0f859c9fcf0f85e', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 1038, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FY6knmnN5mgRQTtAHiempkY84uzUVxibESf_P_jxXZ0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=aa976aa65cd2be163d6bc58a0fb74e52c5726927', 'width': 999}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,1592507760.0,,,,,,

Hey, I've got a couple of questions about charting within IB.

\-Is there any way to use more of the TA annotations other than the 6 or so other shown in the ""edit"" tab?

\-I've been having a problem over the last week while charting, for some reason in multiple tickers there is a gap within the chart spanning hundreds of candles. The candles are non-existant, is this a common bug? Are there any fixes to it?

\-Within the chart, whenever I scroll up or down the candles seem to enlarger, and decrease in size. What is the reason for this, and is there any reason to turn it off?

\-Is there any way to zoom out on the X axis?

\-Along with this, I'm having a hard time trying to unhide my toolbar on my charts, any solutions?

Thank you, I appreciate any insight",,,,,,,,,,,,

investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Demetri Kofinas speaks with Tony Greer, editor of the Morning Navigator and founder of TG Macro.  This episode begins with a clip from David Portnoy (a.k.a Barstool Dave or Davey Daytrader), in what is probably the most epic hype video ever created for stock trading.   

Portnoy has come to personify not only the recent rip-roaring retracement in equities, but also, the philosophy that the stock market no longer bears any relationship to the real economy. ‚ÄúIt took me a while to figure out that the stock market isn‚Äôt connected to the economy,‚Äù according to David Portnoy. ‚ÄúI tell people there are two rules to investing: Stocks only go up, and if you have any problems, see rule No. 1.‚Äù  

Extraordinary monetary interventions remain the single most important causal factor for explaining this phenomenon (what we have referred to on this show as ‚Äúmarket nihilism‚Äù). Whether investment flows are coming from passive funds or ‚Äúpassive people,‚Äù what‚Äôs important is that the allocators invest indiscriminately. As the popular fraise goes: ‚ÄúAlways buy the fucking dip‚Äù ([\#ABTFD](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ABTFD))  

In our past episodes with Mike Green, we have explored the role of systematic passive investment vehicles in driving markets higher. With the recent return of the retail investor an additional layer of passivity has been added. Not only are these investors seemingly ‚Äúprice inelastic,‚Äù but they also exhibit a disturbing level of indifference to fundamentals that is qualitatively different from anything seen in past generations. Unlike the Gen-X and Boomer cohorts of 1999 who felt that they could see a future that others could not yet perceive, this generation of zoomers and millennials seems to feel that they have figured out something far more fundamental about how things work today. In their view, the notion that the stock market has any relationship to economic reality is laughable. Fundamentals can‚Äôt hold a candle to Jay Powell and his money printer. Along with this realization comes a mocking, self-deprecatory celebration of aberrance. Indeed, going through r/WallStreetBets or wojack images on crypto subreddits exposes you to imagery that is reminiscent of a scene from the Island of Dr. Moreau.  

In their 90-minute conversation, Tony and Demetri explore all of these themes. They discuss the recent rip-roaring retracement in equities and how the Federal Reserve, with its relentless money-printing has broken the economy, turned the stock market into a casino, and sown the seeds for a political crisis unlike any we have seen in more than a generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Last Thursday market had a big gap down and sell-off. Japanese candlestick charting refers to these gaps as a window. Once you open a window it can be very hard to close it. Yesterday despite bullish efforts that window remained open.

New unemployment numbers are due out this morning. This number could be a catalyst for the overall markets. I'll be watching it this week.

Bears are making an effort to retake control this morning. Futures are lower as I write this but choppy.

I'm still staying cautious. But willing to take perfect setups. There's still plenty of money to be made out there.

**Watchlist:**

**CLWT** is a low float, resistance at $4

**ARTW** is a low float, watching for a setup above $4

**AMS** is a low float, support likely at $3.50

**LYL** is a low float, watching for a setup above $2.20

**AFH** is a low float, on watch

**MLND** is a low float, resistance at $3.40

**KIRK** is a low float, support at $2

**NLS** is a lowish float, I'll only buy above $8

**WTER** has resistance at $1.80

**AFMD** watching for a setup above $3.75

**IDEX** has resistance at $2.40

**MNKD** has resistance at $2",,,,,,,,,,,,

In conclusion, I think that Avast is a good company operating in a growing industry with a lot of competition. The company has a lot of debt, but the amount of debt has gone down in the last couple of years. When calculating the intrinsic value we found out that the company is currently overpriced. I would be willing to buy Avast if the price would be around $450 (365 GBP)

**Summary:** Denali Therapeutics (NASDAQ: DNLI) and Alector (NASDAQ: ALEC) are two high-profile companies taking a new angle on neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (PD &amp; AD), notoriously tough nuts to crack. We are cautiously excited about a handful of innovative companies including the two highlighted here (we also previously wrote about Passage Bio (NASDAQ: PASG), a gene therapy CNS player we took a position in).

ALEC leverages association studies to identify genetic targets and biomarkers for immuno-neurology therapies. DNLI also takes a genetically-driven approach to target selection, and possesses a proprietary blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport platform. A look at their pipelines reveals some overlapping targets (progranulin in FTD, TREM2 in AD), reflecting the similar philosophical starting point for these companies. This article will focus on the case for and against ALEC.

**Alector |** **Key Takeaways**

* **ALEC does not provide sufficient value at $32.70 with a market cap of \~$2.6B given a 12 month target price of $25 - 30.**
* **While ALEC has strong peak sales potential, probability of technical and regulatory success is low.** While we model \~$1.2B in peak sales potential for AL001 (\~$550M in FTD-GRN and \~$700M in FTD-C9orf72), we assign the FTD-GRN and FTD-C9orf72 indications a probability of approval of \~15% and \~10% respectively. We assess a probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS) of \~10% for their AbbVie-partnered AD portfolio (peak sales of \~$10B, 50% of which goes to ALEC). After accounting for the 50:50 AbbVie profit split, the PTRS-adjusted peak sales for ALEC across their lead programs (i.e., programs with or expecting first clinical data this year) is \~$735M. Additional upside may be driven by AL101 and other earlier-stage programs. We believe this is a generous assessment of their pipeline PTRS and does not fully capture execution risk, competitive dynamics, and underlying clinical uncertainties.
* **In our assessment, we believe that ALEC should be priced between $25 - 30 per share.** Applying a peak sales multiple of 3.5 - 4x, we forecast a risk-adjusted valuation of $2.8B in 2024 midyear when AL001 is expected to be under regulatory evaluation / near-launch and the AD assets in pivotal trials, against the current market cap of $2.6B. Using a discount rate of 11 - 13%, this translates to a 12-month price target of $25 - 30, representing \~25% downside over the current price of $32.70. However, given the number of potential inflection points (and fairly low bar for success given the use of biomarker endpoints in early stage trials and need for therapies) we would not be surprised if the market continues to reward ALEC despite the underlying concerns we have.
* **While we do expect ALEC price movement driven by pipeline advancement in 2020, on a risk-adjusted basis we would not expect ALEC to hold onto these gains in the long run.** We would caution from indexing too heavily on P1/2 biomarker data as a derisking signal for pivotal development: it remains unclear the extent to which efficacy along these biomarkers will correlate with clinically meaningful impacts given the sheer complexity of neurodegeneration and cognitive function/decline.

**The Case for ALEC:**

* ***Multiple near-term inflection points in 2020:*** ALEC is expected to report data in the coming weeks from their P2 trial for lead asset AL001 in FTD patients with GRN and C9orf72 mutations. Key data to look out for (beyond the usual safety and PK) are impact on neurofilament light (NfL), a biomarker for neurodegeneration, and volumetric MRI (vMRI), a biomarker for brain atrophy. In P1 trials, AL001 restored plasma and CSF PGRN levels back to the normal range, a positive signal of drug activity, and reduced plasma NfL by an average of 14%. Additionally, P1b data in mild-moderate AD patients is expected for AL002 and AL003 this year, with AL002 expected to move to P2 by EOY (programs partnered with AbbVie).
* ***Extremely strong leadership team and scientific advisory board, large industry partnership, and strong cash position***\*\*:\*\* ALEC boasts an experienced leadership team and prestigious scientific advisory board. While this is no guarantee for success, a company‚Äôs ability to get thought leaders to sign on does provide some signal to potential investors that there is scientific and clinical promise. Along the same lines, we consider ALEC‚Äôs large collaboration with AbbVie on their AD programs ($205M upfront for ALEC) a similar positive signal. Moreover, ALEC remains well-funded with \~$550M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.
* ***ALEC is the development leader in FTD-GRN:*** ALEC is in the pole position in FTD-GRN, though a number of competitors are poised to enter the clinic including DNLI and multiple gene therapy players (PASG, PRVL). FTD-GRN constitutes 5 - 10% of the 50 - 60 K FTD cases in the U.S., or about 3 - 6 K patients. C9orf72 variants are estimated to occur in 7 - 12% of FTD cases (4 - 7 K patients). ALEC will get to take the first shot at helping this high need population. We model approximately \~$1.2B in peak sales potential for AL001 (\~$550M in FTD-GRN and \~$700M in FTD-C9orf72). However, we also note that the scientific rationale for AL001, which promotes circulating levels of PGRN by downregulation of the SORT1 degradation pathway, is less clear in the larger FTD-C9orf72 patient population.
* ***Multiple shots on goal in AD in early-stage clinical trials with first clinical data expected this year:*** Both AL002 and AL003 target pathways implicated in AD and are in early stages of clinical development, providing ALEC two bites at the apple with P1 proof-of-mechanism data expected in 2020. Our back-of-the-envelope directional peak sales estimate for ALEC‚Äôs Alzheimer‚Äôs franchise is \~$10B (non-risk adjusted). ALEC is entitled to 50% of global profits. If Biogen‚Äôs aducanumab is rejected, this number could conceivably climb even higher.

**The Case Against ALEC:**

* ***Clinical relevance of AL001‚Äôs demonstrated impact on biomarkers is unclear:*** The P1 data for AL001 showed a 14% decrease from baseline in NfL plasma levels in the 5 patients available for assessment at 3 months: it is unclear if this is will prove to be clinically meaningful in FTD (for some context, disease-modifying MS therapies appear to reduce NfL by 20 - 40% after several months to years on therapy). FTD patients tend to have on average upwards of 5-7x NfL levels compared to healthy controls, so the extent to which a 14% reduction will be correlated with a clinically meaningful slowing of the neurodegenerative process is far from certain.
* ***The strength of the scientific rationale for their lead programs is variable:*** AL001 increases PGRN by downregulating SORT1, a degradation pathway for PGRN. Early data suggests AL001 efficiently increases PGRN to normal levels, a positive indication of drug activity. However, systemic upregulation of PGRN via suppression of SORT1 may present oncogenic risks. Progranulin and its bioactive fragments are noted to be overexpressed in many cancer types. Castration-resistant prostate cancer is associated with sortilin loss and overexpressed progranulin: this is the exact pathway that AL001 modulates. Furthermore, we are also generally hesitant about AL002, which targets TREM2 in AD. TREM2‚Äôs role in neurodegeneration is complex, with differing signals suggesting it may be up- or down-regulated at different points in the disease course, which leads us to take a pessimistic view regarding its potential as a drug target in AD. AL003 inhibits SIGLEC3, a unique mechanistic approach in AD.
* ***Repeated systemic administration of biologics may present implementation barriers in the real-world for patients with neurodegeneration:*** ALEC‚Äôs portfolio consists of antibodies, which may require that patients come to clinics to receive infusions. Considering the specific makeup of their target population (i.e., patients with declining cognitive function and corresponding behavioral issues and confusion), we could foresee maintaining patient compliance being challenging. We thus would predict clinical preference for a single-administration therapy (a gene therapy) or orally-delivered small molecule if possible. We would expect disproportionate Medicare representation for neurodegeneration (though not so much for FTD-GRN, an earlier-onset disease)- the introduction of step edits on Medicare Part B could feasibly even allow for a step edit through oral agents given the potential cost savings (assuming an oral is lower cost, particularly from a total cost of care perspective).

I started to just take a peek at luxury car brands and auto groups as well as their stock prices.. nothing looked all too appealing except AUDI. The reason i say audi is they own a group of subsidiaries which most know of, Ducati, Lamborghini, Volkswagen to name a few... and long story short i find that as of monday it was sitting at 1000 euros which id have scooped up, but it gained 50% to 1500 euros.

Not here to cry over spilt milk, but the stock charts look different than anything ive seen or understand as im still fairly new. I am mainly wondering what would cause such a drastic increase of almost 600$usd over night for a company in a hurting sector.. Even before corona people were slowing down on purchase of luxury cars as of October 2019. There was no big news that i seen that would cause this either. 

The reason i look to understand this is so in the future i can jump in, i was barely a day late this time, and this wouldve been a killer investment for someone as new as myself.

I'd love to invest more except 1) all prices are pretty much back to where they were pre-crash, is there any more headroom? Are we really just going to keep climbing and climbing and climbing? 2) it isn't actually 'real' value it seems in terms of economics. It looks more-so like a social and political valuation than anything fundamental.

Thus, i am hesitant to continue my investment savings if this possibly false intervention is just going to crash stocks again and then the actual recovery ensues. Which would perhaps be a slow trickle of growth over years like after the 2007/08 crisis. I don't believe economies or markets just bounce back after a few weeks then continue as usual. The growth in markets now days is just ridiculous. It looks exponential compared to the decades of the 1900s. Financialization does that i suppose.

Markets are set to open higher, if we have another day of gains last week's big selloff could be completely erased.

It goes to show the power of the Fed and what the money printer is capable of. It seems every time the market dips the Fed intervenes. The long term consequences are yet to be seen.

I'm going to enjoy this bull run as long as it lasts. It's not sustainable but could last for years.

What are the best videos or articles you've seen that helps explain it in an easy to understand way?

Example video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIqgCyEWtsw) with the Sacramento Kings owner addressing the state of the economy starting at 3 minutes. He talks about the next 10 years seeing more wealth creation than ever before and adding that we've leaped years ahead as far as digital transformation of certain markets (thinking of companies like Zoom, PayPal, Shopify, ServiceNow, DocuSign).

BioSolar, Inc is an OTC traded sub-penny stock traded under the symbol BRSC. (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BSRC:US) 

About 5 weeks ago, few early callers had been buzzing about BSRC.

I couldn't sleep, so I got onto r/pennystocks to watch Salm get crucified, and I saw someone mention it again. So I decided to look into it back in early April to see if there was anything to this random ticker. 

BioSolar is a Renewable Energy Equipment technology company, trading as part of the Renewable Energy industry and Energy sector. 

The company board is comprised of Dr. Donghie ""David"" Lee and partner Dennis Lepon. BSRC officially only employs, and is run by Dr. Donghie (David) Lee (professional profile: https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/person/15905709).

Dr. Lee is the CEO, and acting CFO of this company. He's a brilliant mind in his field (http://keenforgreen.com/b/interview-dr-david-lee-ceo-biosolar-renewable-plastics-solar). 
- PhD at Purdue in Electrical Engineering.
- Master of Science at University of Michigan in Electrical Engineering.
- Bachelor of Science at University of Texas in (you guessed it by now) Electrical Engineering. The man knows his chops in electrical engineering and is highly respected in his field. 
He is partnered with Dr. Stanley B Levy as a chief technology officer, and Tom Becker runs investor relations. 

While initially the low employees and small figures seem too small to be significant, or almost as if this is just another pump and dump, this is actually a wise move on BSRC's part: 
- The research staff are 1099 contractors [low/no overhead].
- BSRC doesn't consistently need sprawling expensive labratories for proof of concepts [low/no overhead].
- The focus of this business is not large scale production or continuous product launches. 
What BioSolar deals in are intellectual properties of Dr. Lee. The patents (see below) are what make this company valuable. 

BSRC recently (and quietly) filed a patent early in the morning on June 2, when all US exchanges were asleep, and most sites and bulletins overlooked it. (https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-06-02/biosolar-files-patent-for-silicon-alloy-anode-for-high-power-batteries) (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/02/2041942/0/en/BioSolar-Files-Patent-for-Silicon-Alloy-Anode-for-High-Power-Batteries.html) 

This patent is a fundamental and crucial shift in the design and durability of lithium rechargable batteries. This technology allows a fragile and expensive component in a battery (see the patent for details of the anode changes). The patent that BSRC holds swaps an extremely inexpensive silica replacement which eliminates the need for a heat expulsion in high discharge batteries. Presently, they have prototypes that are cheaper and many magnitudes more durable than present options on the market. 

TL;DR - The company owns the tech to make expensive short-lived batteries (like in Teslas, Volts, power tools, phones) cheap and much more durable. They are making a necessary process much cheaper and easier on producers - Suppliers and producers always bid on either the cheapest or most durable option. This is both. 

It is almost certain that the producers of the batteries we are becoming more and more reliant on will migrate to this technology. It makes production cheaper, rely less on silver (expensive and fragile), uses readily available silica compounds (cheap and durable), and eliminates heat in high energy expenditure. This is immensely useful in power tools and electric cars and vehicles, as well as in cell phones, laptops, and tablets. The applications are virtually universal to any battery-reliant device. 

The patent these guys own will be licensed and the company value will soar when this happens. 

Today alone, the stock is up 22% EOD. 

All of this is in addition to BSRC already owning Dr. Lee's research on a more efficient biodigradable backing and packaging for solar panel cells. 

Looking at BSRC as a stock, and not just the tech they hold: 

BSRC is a 221.64M outstanding share company, that moves on a 30 day volume around 5.6M shares. Don't be fooled - those shares are at or under .01$. Bonus! They have earnings announcement on 08/07/2020. With this new patent to market, these are likely to be positive results, and today's climb of over 20% shows interest is growing. For dumbed-down math sakes; at only $0.01 (actual price is .006), they are still only at 25% of their 52 week high of $0.04. That is only a small percentage of their 5y high of $0.52!
These prices were before the company had ANY sort of patent this valuable or immediately useful to an exploding market. This shows there is definite history of higher trade and expansion within the recent past, showing over 400% potential valuation change from today's close. They are in the recovering Energy sector, and are a green energy focused company. This is a double-win, as both these sectors are up. 

Some risks: They trade OTC. They will not be available unless your broker does Pink papers (Fidelity is good). They are LOW market cap: 1.330 M. You read that right. This is risky to some investors, because they aren't listed on NASDAQ or anything like that. Harder to find means fewer (and no RH or Blue Chip Only) investors. Further, BSRC is literally a sub- .01 penny stock at the time of writing this. This means it's got a ways to go to listing, and a reverse split is likely on its way to the stratosphere. 
Their EPS is a nasty .-03, because they have been virtually dormant while Dr. Lee has been developing this most recent patent. 
Their 1 year return for their small handful of investors during this inactive period was a heartbreaking -70%. 

This should be much different in the coming year. 

This is not your volatile temper-tantrum throwing GNUS or DGLY, (currently, at least). It is a small, low-volume company still. This is also off-putting to many investors, because this means no giant leaps or immediate 2-day get rich explosions. 

My thoughts: 
This is a ticking time bomb of inexpensive profitability that will give impressive results when the company's patented technology becomes mainstream. BSRC is a long hold, but it is still so inexpensive that getting in is cheap enough to buy many shares even for 1.00$. With little to lose at such a low price, it's easy to test the waters and decide if you're confident in BSRC.

On June 17th, 2019 the S&amp;P500 high of the day was 2897. Today (June 16th, 2020) the S&amp;P500 closed at 3124.

Current   S&amp;P500 PE ratio is 22.40. If history does repeat itself, end of   recessions don't happen until that number comes down to around 10. I   think stock market is ridiculously expensive right now. I lived through   the past 2 recessions. I remember back then there was a lot of hysteria   in the market right before the crash started and I've been seeing a  lot  of that now. Newbie investors are buying up stocks like Hertz,  which has  already declared bankruptcy. If there was a local restaurant  doing very  bad and declared bankruptcy, would you invest in it?

According   to Bridgewater Associate's analysis on the impact of COVID-19 on the   economy, when unemployment rate is at 10%, airline industries will take a   85% drop in earnings. American Airlines Stock is at 17 today. If you  do  the math and factor in the potential earnings drop, the stock should  be  at 5. Warren Buffett thought AAL was expensive even at 11 and he is  right. He probably knows a lot more about companies than most of us.

Also,  a lot of newbie  investors keep saying ""don't fight the fed."" They will  keep the printer  going. All you need to look at is the Nikkei chart  starting from the  80's. Japan kept printing massive amounts of money in  the 90's, which  resulted in the economy going through a depression for  the next 20  years.

I know there are a lot of new investors out there. I would be very, very cautious about buying any stocks right now.",self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'lZ96-Ux4R4Yo7hX6ryXwtIOhW2UhjZbEKoqNn9ISobw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gjHToWjZuImNOPwxymhevw2KWqxDRM1FiufkZK_MoTY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31dca1a6882c7a9ec64fe817dd5f38f6575538a5', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gjHToWjZuImNOPwxymhevw2KWqxDRM1FiufkZK_MoTY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a30e3ba48a1a9ccf23e5e64538a9fbabdb7d07b', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 300, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gjHToWjZuImNOPwxymhevw2KWqxDRM1FiufkZK_MoTY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0a387ad7d27e1adfa8fe133dcc7e9618da264d86', 'width': 300}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

DNLI also takes a genetically-driven approach to target selection, and possesses a proprietary blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport platform. A look at their pipelines reveals some overlapping targets (progranulin in FTD, TREM2 in AD), reflecting the similar philosophical starting point for these companies. This article will focus on the case for and against DNLI.  


**Denali | Key Takeaways:**

* **We are cautiously excited about DNLI‚Äôs pipeline and drug delivery platform, but do not expect to see durable upside in the near-term at the current valuation.**
* **We value DNLI at \~$5.4B versus a current market cap of \~$2.9B based on programs with initial clinical data by 2020 (DNL201 or DNL151 in PD, DNL747 in AD and ALS).** Crucially, DNLI has not partnered out their PD program, which has peak sales potential of \~$9B, bolstering the company valuation. This also does not include the potential of their earlier-stage programs or the value of their drug delivery platform itself.
* Given the expected time to clinic and a discount rate of 11 - 13%, we are setting a 12 month price target of $30 - 35, **reflecting \~20% upside to the current price of $27.83.**
* **DNLI offers some modest near-term potential inflection points** in advancing to P2/P3 trial in PD (either DNL201 or DNL151) and a P1 readout for their Sanofi-partnered AD program in the coming months, and may also benefit indirectly from the clinical proof of concept for competitor programs with shared targets (e.g., PGRN, TREM2).
* **While upside exists for DNLI, the upside at the current price point is not sufficient for WX Capital to initiate a position in the company.**

**The Case for DNLI:**

* ***Potential first-to-market disease-modifying therapy in Parkinson‚Äôs Disease:*** Current agents used in PD are limited to symptom-mitigation, whereas theoretically DNLI‚Äôs LRRK2-targeting agents could slow degeneration itself. The current PD global market is worth approximately $5B U.S., indicating a substantial opportunity exists for a disease-modifying treatment. Overall we model a \~$9B peak sales opportunity in PD with \~14% PTRS assuming DNLI is the only disease-modifying therapy available (Biogen‚Äôs BIIB054 P2 trial in PD is expected to readout 2H20, and would be a key competitor).
* ***Well-pedigreed leadership and investor team, multiple validating strategic industry partnerships, and strong cash position:*** DNLI‚Äôs leadership team is largely composed of Genentech veterans, widely considered one of the more reputable and scientifically-rigorous companies in the industry. DNLI also has several bluechip investors behind them such as ARCH and Flagship. Furthermore, DNLI secured two large cornerstone partnerships with large companies in Takeda and Sanofi. The Takeda deal covers preclinical programs in FTD-GRN (DNL-593, recombinant progranulin) and AD (ATV:TREM2 and ATV:Tau) and earned DNLI $150M upfront. The Sanofi deal ($125M upfront) covers DNL747 and DNL758, small molecule drugs targeting RIPK1 in P1 for neurological (AD, ALS, MS) and peripheral inflammatory diseases (RA, psoriasis), respectively. DNLI currently has \~$595M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.
* ***Platform includes both brain-penetrant small molecules and antibodies:*** On aggregate, we prefer DNLI‚Äôs technology platform given it encompasses both antibodies and brain-penetrant small molecules. In general an oral option will win out over an infused biologic assuming broadly comparable efficacy, and we believe this dynamic would be only more acute in a neurodegenerative population. Therefore, while DNLI‚Äôs most advanced AD asset DNL747 is slightly trailing ALEC‚Äôs programs, all else being equal we prefer DNL747 given its ROA. We are also excited about the RIPK1 target‚Äôs potential across multiple indications both in and out of CNS, which we believe derisks its overall clinical development.
* ***DNLI‚Äôs blood-brain-barrier (BBB) drug delivery platform itself has meaningful value:*** DNLI has also invested in a proprietary delivery platform based on leveraging the transferrin receptor to improve CNS-targeted delivery of large molecules (e.g., antibodies and enzymes). This technology underlies their AD programs. We have the same pathway concerns for their PGRN-targeting FTD programs and TREM2-targeting AD programs as we discussed for ALEC. However, we would be interested to see how DNLI‚Äôs delivery platform could potentially enable more efficient trafficking to the brain and thus allow for lower systemic dosing, improving the overall product profile for similar targets.

**The Case Against DNLI:**

* ***$2.9B market cap and lack of near-term catalysts does not provide predictable upside at this time:*** We model a \~$9B opportunity in PD (\~$1.3B PTRS-adjusted) and a \~$3B opportunity in AD (\~$315M PTRS-adjusted). DNLI is entitled to 50% of the AD program profits. Using a peak sales multiple of 3.5 - 4x, we assign DNLI a risk-adjusted valuation of $5.4B by approximately 2025, discounting to a 12-month price target of $30 - 35 (\~20% upside to current price of $27.83).
* ***Fairly early-stage clinical pipeline in high-risk indications:*** As a general observation, DNLI‚Äôs pipeline is quite early-stage and as noted previously CNS development is extremely challenging. We do not have much by way of derisking proof-of-concept data at this point, so believe the PTRS for each program is in the 10 - 20% range, similar to ALEC. Additionally, DNL201 faced a partial clinical hold in P1 trials due to preclinical toxicity data, though this was ultimately removed.
* ***Limited near-term inflection points:*** In contrast to ALEC, we do not foresee many inflection points in the next 12 months. Some milestones that are on the horizon include advancing a PD program to P2/3 (DNL201 or DNL151), P1 updates on their AD/ALS program (DNL747), and initiation of a P1/2 trial in MPS II (DNL310). We also would not be surprised to see updates from the Sanofi-led DNL758 program in peripheral inflammation or on other early-stage programs, but do not anticipate many other needle-moving events.

If you feel overwhelmed, or overhyped about your positions,

If you feel too proud and overconfident or too shameful and depressed about your current gain/loss situation

If you cannot understand and predict markets reactions to certain events and contemprorary world situation

It is normal for an investor/speculator/trader to take a break and step aside

You don't need to constantly keep track of unlimited possibilities; hyphotetical gains and losses.

You don't need to actively be a bear or bull

You can step aside if you want to, think about millions/billions of people with no stock market involvement, it is not a freaking game which you can only win or lose,

Try to develop a strong market psychology and escape or rapid positioning  strategies and stick with it, and sometimes cutting cords from the market and being an ordinary cash holding observer can change your life. Missing a rally isn't the end of the world

Market is and will always be full of opportunities

Back when I started investing I put a decent chunk at a low price per share in a company that seemed to be unique.  Unfortunately they never grew their stock price over the past 3 years how I had hoped, and it's basically a penny stock on the OTCQB. They haven't impressed me with their growth and it almost seems more shady than legit.  It had a run that was very healthy early 2019 but ever since then it's been dragging down.

At this point since I bought so low I have still doubled my money, but I am trying to figure out if it's a good decision to sell and stack up on my more stable investments and never touch a penny stock again. Does anybody here have any experience, insight or knowledge in sniffing out a company that might be full of hot air - or how to evaluate whether or not it's a good time to sell and never look back?

I'm not asking anyone to read the future if the stock will climb again - just basically trying to tell if this thing is going to bottom out and the company ending up bankrupt. Lot's of negative posts on Investorshub and usually I ignore that but some claims seem legit. 

Thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, numerous volunteers at [r/NexusAurora](https://www.reddit.com/r/NexusAurora/) have been working hard on the challenge. The first draft is out and we are hoping to get some constructive criticism. The entire authoring process is done via Discord &amp; Google Drive. These are several issues that we want to address.

**Too Lightweight** \- The information density on this report should be increased 2x by shrinking font size, line height and paddings and adopting a 2 column layout for easy reading in this setup. (Scientific papers have this tendency)

**It Lacks Insights** \- What I am reading sounds right now like somebody who spent a lot of time on the forums and cherry-picked the prettiest solutions. There is no deep explanation arguing why we chose tech X instead of the alternatives.

**PROs and CONs** \- There are none right now. Before advancing a solution please also acknowledge it's weaknesses. That indicates that you truly master the topic and that you are aware of it's potential pitfalls.

**Falls Short On Economics &amp; Life Balance** \- Yesterday's meeting concluded that Marsorbust and Felix (Administration Lead) will ask each team to provide more insights over the economics and human well being.

**Stages are not fully explained per project** \- Staging is hand waved at best. There is no common agreement between domains what are the stages solutions and how they interlock. We have no contingency plan if Earth gets nuked in year 15 of the process.

**Better Graphics** \- Part of the current graphics are pretty pictures. At the last Core meeting from yesterday we discussed the possibility of having infographics with high density information.",self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'qFoR9f-JdKyPrWW-Lfy6i8utSCETTU6_Hq-s8IDlrtU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ftKmzR5Y8hije6S563VRkV1u2dBwkVrNjN2T7ancxcI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c732be2304d6335eb0007b42e2d85bf06b9fcb41', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ftKmzR5Y8hije6S563VRkV1u2dBwkVrNjN2T7ancxcI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=467e9f93643c421ed8eb34294df95550567ec8b0', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ftKmzR5Y8hije6S563VRkV1u2dBwkVrNjN2T7ancxcI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfa448b61c85f2d8cb3d5140577a0eb6b10001b0', 'width': 320}, {'height': 336, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ftKmzR5Y8hije6S563VRkV1u2dBwkVrNjN2T7ancxcI.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8969964757d361e168616b277a26def84babb12', 'width': 640}, {'height': 504, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ftKmzR5Y8hije6S563VRkV1u2dBwkVrNjN2T7ancxcI.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88639bb20d183596ad6f7d4489d2da3026ab581a', 'width': 960}, {'height': 567, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ftKmzR5Y8hije6S563VRkV1u2dBwkVrNjN2T7ancxcI.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e25ae668a2370fac87f95ab7913e0b6458ad417', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 630, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ftKmzR5Y8hije6S563VRkV1u2dBwkVrNjN2T7ancxcI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=efd5b12ae1bcbcf1149cb31b7e12f72793cd8fa8', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

I'd like to invest half of my earnings every month to stock. Around 500‚Ç¨ and save the other half for the future crisis. 
Anyway I'd like to have some pieces of advice about finding good stocks and analysing them.

For the moment, I can't see anything but high cap stocks that get much media coverage. How do you find medium or low cap stocks that have potentials? 

About analysis, my brain really doesn't understand the quantitative analysis. If google stock is overvalued, how do you quantitatively calculate that it's overvalued? 

Any other advices are welcomed.
I'm thinking of investing in V and AXP for long term.
They seem like good stocks with many potential customers in 3rd world countries. I also heard that AXP is the first company allowed to work in china in this field. I really have no positive feelings apart from these for now. Please humble me with your knowledges :D",,,,,,,,,,,,

but never found a good time to invest. After reading the news about the [cyberstalking](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-issues-statement-regarding-indictments-of-previously-terminated-employees/) by a [previous founder](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53055351) I decided to stop putting my analysis off!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwldi588fa551.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99b46a32c6498172c7642bf8f85e16863267b40\n\n**What Has Changed With eBay?**\n\nIf like me, you know the brand but haven\'t invested you might have missed the latest news. A week ago [eBay announced $750m of financing](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-prices-750-million-senior-unsecured-notes-offering-2/) in unsecured notes with the primary purpose of paying off its 2021 notes and any other debt which is more expensive than this offer, before using the proceeds for general admin.\n\neBay also [increased their forecasts](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-reports-stronger-volume-growth-and-raises-revenue-and-gaap-and-non-gaap-eps-guidance-for-q2-2020/) for Q2 2020. Apparently, between April 29th and June 4th, eBay has seen ""significantly better than expectations"" and due to the ""magnitude of this change,"" they have increased estimates. With the current user activity already running at the higher end of the original estimates, and ""all major verticals are accelerating significantly compared to previous quarters."" As COVID-19 lockdowns start to ease up and businesses are encouraged to reopen, eBay is seeing increased growth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8x6jj49fa551.jpg?width=683&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1c68dbbac692e9d32a32a852ac2931e48b922bd\n\nSource: [eBay Investor Relations](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-reports-stronger-volume-growth-and-raises-revenue-and-gaap-and-non-gaap-eps-guidance-for-q2-2020/)\n\nWhile this sounds strong on the surface, the announcement also includes a mention of its marketing activities and increasing the spend. eBay is giving new sellers the chance to sell for free, has extended seller protection and incentives, and increased the amount of free fixed fee listings you can have. These activities were critical as shelter-in-place orders were issued, carrying these offers on could be seen as snapping up more marketing share while businesses are looking to reopen or it could be leaving money on the table.\n\nThe biggest news is the new CEO has joined and been in charge from April 27th, Jamie Iannone. He\'s worked on digital products for Barnes &amp; Noble, CEO of SamsClub and promoted to COO of Walmart. We have yet to know what changes his influence will bring.\n\n**How Do eBay\'s Fundamentals Look?**\n\nWith Q1 out and judged by the market, and recent announcements about future growth already digested, we are in the perfect spot to think about the facts and figures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytw6ody9fa551.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8530223ab12fdc36d1a3bb4539be2df046c00500\n\nSource: [Genuine Impact](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-reports-stronger-volume-growth-and-raises-revenue-and-gaap-and-non-gaap-eps-guidance-for-q2-2020/)\n\nOn the surface, eBay looks to be an extremely solid long term investment. Financially sound, a little overpriced but we aren\'t talking Tesla levels, and strong future growth (as per their Q2 estimate update.) \n\nLet\'s dive into the raw numbers to understand and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of eBay.\n\nOne of the biggest attractions for investors in the early days of eBay was PayPal, which then turned into a risk. These days eBay is moving to its managed payment solution, it\'s a big step to vertically integrating and removing 3rd party risks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buji9ztafa551.jpg?width=1212&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7b4d75571f1850f6623e341b7a65bf2b14e3aa\n\nSource: [eBay Q1 2020 Presentation](https://ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2020/q1/1Q20-EBAY-Earnings.pdf), *MS&amp;O = Marketing Services &amp; Other Revenue*\n\nIn terms of revenue, we are slowly decreasing. The trailing 12 months compared to the previous period is showing an increase but the quarterly trend is turning negative. \n\nWe are still looking at $10.5bn in revenue over 12 months. These numbers were even more impressive back in 2015, we were closer to $19bn back then. The revenue eBay brings is interesting, but what is impressive is the 76.78% gross margin with a punchy 16.54% profit margin. \n\nThat profit margin does have a consistency problem.

I don\'t hold eBay and don\'t plan on buying it. If I held eBay I would look to exit.\n\nThere isn\'t the exciting growth I would expect from a company like eBay. There are more interesting or reliable places to put my money. As a business, they have turned into a slower-moving giant, and they don\'t give me the impression they are doing enough to protect from disruption other than increasing marketing spend. The technology seems to be keeping pace with competitors but they aren\'t passing anyone.\n\nFor me, eBay doesn\'t give me the confidence it\'s going to be a smooth upward trend for the next five years, and it doesn\'t show signs of any radical innovation which would meaningfully move the needle. eBay might be a household name, but it\'s not an investment that will live in my portfolio.\n\nLet me know what you think, do you have a different view on eBay? Is there more to expect which I am missing? Or is my view too pessimistic? \n\nThanks for reading and stay safe.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had my eye on eBay for a while but never found a good time to invest. After reading the news about the &lt;a href=""https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-issues-statement-regarding-indictments-of-previously-terminated-employees/""&gt;cyberstalking&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53055351""&gt;previous founder&lt;/a&gt; I decided to stop putting my analysis off!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/xwldi588fa551.png?width=512&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e99b46a32c6498172c7642bf8f85e16863267b40""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xwldi588fa551.png?width=512&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e99b46a32c6498172c7642bf8f85e16863267b40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Has Changed With eBay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If like me, you know the brand but haven&amp;#39;t invested you might have missed the latest news. A week ago &lt;a href=""https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-prices-750-million-senior-unsecured-notes-offering-2/""&gt;eBay announced $750m of financing&lt;/a&gt; in unsecured notes with the primary purpose of paying off its 2021 notes and any other debt which is more expensive than this offer, before using the proceeds for general admin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;eBay also &lt;a href=""https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-reports-stronger-volume-growth-and-raises-revenue-and-gaap-and-non-gaap-eps-guidance-for-q2-2020/""&gt;increased their forecasts&lt;/a&gt; for Q2 2020. Apparently, between April 29th and June 4th, eBay has seen &amp;quot;significantly better than expectations&amp;quot; and due to the &amp;quot;magnitude of this change,&amp;quot; they have increased estimates. With the current user activity already running at the higher end of the original estimates, and &amp;quot;all major verticals are accelerating significantly compared to previous quarters.&amp;quot; As COVID-19 lockdowns start to ease up and businesses are encouraged to reopen, eBay is seeing increased growth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/h8x6jj49fa551.jpg?width=683&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f1c68dbbac692e9d32a32a852ac2931e48b922bd""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/h8x6jj49fa551.jpg?width=683&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f1c68dbbac692e9d32a32a852ac2931e48b922bd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=""https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-reports-stronger-volume-growth-and-raises-revenue-and-gaap-and-non-gaap-eps-guidance-for-q2-2020/""&gt;eBay Investor Relations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While this sounds strong on the surface, the announcement also includes a mention of its marketing activities and increasing the spend. eBay is giving new sellers the chance to sell for free, has extended seller protection and incentives, and increased the amount of free fixed fee listings you can have. These activities were critical as shelter-in-place orders were issued, carrying these offers on could be seen as snapping up more marketing share while businesses are looking to reopen or it could be leaving money on the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest news is the new CEO has joined and been in charge from April 27th, Jamie Iannone. He&amp;#39;s worked on digital products for Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, CEO of SamsClub and promoted to COO of Walmart. We have yet to know what changes his influence will bring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Do eBay&amp;#39;s Fundamentals Look?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Q1 out and judged by the market, and recent announcements about future growth already digested, we are in the perfect spot to think about the facts and figures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ytw6ody9fa551.png?width=772&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8530223ab12fdc36d1a3bb4539be2df046c00500""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ytw6ody9fa551.png?width=772&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8530223ab12fdc36d1a3bb4539be2df046c00500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=""https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-reports-stronger-volume-growth-and-raises-revenue-and-gaap-and-non-gaap-eps-guidance-for-q2-2020/""&gt;Genuine Impact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the surface, eBay looks to be an extremely solid long term investment. Financially sound, a little overpriced but we aren&amp;#39;t talking Tesla levels, and strong future growth (as per their Q2 estimate update.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s dive into the raw numbers to understand and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of eBay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest attractions for investors in the early days of eBay was PayPal, which then turned into a risk. These days eBay is moving to its managed payment solution, it&amp;#39;s a big step to vertically integrating and removing 3rd party risks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/buji9ztafa551.jpg?width=1212&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aa7b4d75571f1850f6623e341b7a65bf2b14e3aa""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/buji9ztafa551.jpg?width=1212&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aa7b4d75571f1850f6623e341b7a65bf2b14e3aa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=""https://ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2020/q1/1Q20-EBAY-Earnings.pdf""&gt;eBay Q1 2020 Presentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MS&amp;amp;O = Marketing Services &amp;amp; Other Revenue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of revenue, we are slowly decreasing. The trailing 12 months compared to the previous period is showing an increase but the quarterly trend is turning negative. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are still looking at $10.5bn in revenue over 12 months. These numbers were even more impressive back in 2015, we were closer to $19bn back then. The revenue eBay brings is interesting, but what is impressive is the 76.78% gross margin with a punchy 16.54% profit margin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That profit margin does have a consistency problem. As eBay buys and sells competitors and brands the profit swing. Taking a step back to previous annual profit margins we have 23.54% in 2018, -10.62% in 2017, and 80.92% in 2016.

**TRIB** is a low float with resistance at $2.20

**NH** is a low float, watching for a setup above $5

**WRTC** is a low float on watching. I'd like to see it break $10 this week

Why? Well Its not because I think we are going to crash (although it does seem like the markets too optimistic at the moment) but cause I realized I've made alot of mistakes investing. 

1. 25% of my portfolio were in ""speculative"" stocks
2. I had too much of my net worth invested and thus caused me to lose sleep each night. 
3. I have alot to learn about investing and choosing the right companies. In the past I just bought stocks without doing thorough research and finding good price entry points. 
4. The most recent crash made me realized I was in a bad position because I did not have any more money I was willing to put in the market. I saw many companies at steep discounts but I did not have any ""cash to buy"". 

Moving forward I need figure out a solid investing strategy. Also need to figure out my risk tolerance to reduce my stress. Worrying about the market everyday is unhealthy. Make a list of companies I bought want to invest in so that when they do go on sale, I can be ready to buy them in increments. 

I still hold 40% in good companies like amazon, google, Facebook, etc. (Tech heavy but going to keep this until retirement 20-30 years down the road).

&gt; The ‚ÄòRobinhood markets are going to end in tears,‚Äù said Cooperman during CNBC‚Äôs show ‚ÄúHalftime Report‚Äù on Monday, referring to the popular online trading platform.

&gt; Cooperman referred to¬†a Barron‚Äôs article that noted¬†that free trading app Robinhood has added more than three million accounts this year, and now has over 13 million, with a median age of 31.

&gt; Thus far, mom-and-pop investors have¬†outperformed pros like Cooperman and mutual funds, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs. It‚Äôs unclear, however, how long that outperformance will last and to the degree by which individual investors are piling into risky investments with reckless abandonment.

&gt; ‚ÄúLet them buy and trade. From my experience, this kind of stuff will end in tears,‚Äù¬†Cooperman told CNBC.

It seems to me Cooperman is just pissed that the Robinhood app and friends are making the stock market easily available to all armchair traders and that these folks are bringing a new layer of unpredictability into the game.

A little over a year ago, I chose to short TSLA. The stock was trading at $220. The company was facing liquidity issues, their CEO was making PR mistake after PR mistake, and they were very consistent in missing their production goals - usually to a considerable degree.

With the fundamental information I had, I was right. The company and its leadership were so hyped...it was practically a cult. The stock would eventually be properly valued, and I would profit.

Fast-forward and the stock is currently trading in the $1,000 range. Is the company worth $180bn? Absolutely not. Are they currently worth the $40bn valuation to which I originally balked? Probably.

The point here is:  
If enough people are optimistic about a company for all of the wrong reasons until they're, at least where eventual gains are concerned (all that matters), right...it can buy the stock time to earn its valuation. Where does that leave the short-seller? In the red. You can lose to unwarranted optimism. It happens all of the time (Ackman was ""right"" about HLF).

Today, beaten down airlines and hospitality stocks are VERY popular...and they are trading at levels where they ""should not be"" considering all of the uncertainty in the air along with hurdles that are certain. Any recoveries of these stocks should have been slow, but the recoveries are coming quickly. You are smarter than these investors. You know that the rebound has been too early, too strong, and earnings announcements will cause a drop in these companies' evaluations. You're going to short. I'm telling you that the bullishness of these investors can (and likely will) beat you. They can keep these stocks near a premature ATH as long as it takes for these stocks to earn their value again.

I am not suggesting joining the ""bulls"". I only suggest not to bet on the outcome of a fight against them, unless being right and broke is your thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/06/15/the-fed-says-it-is-going-to-start-buying-individual-corporate-bonds.html

The Federal Reserve is expanding its foray into corporate credit to now buy individual corporate bonds, on top of the exchange-traded funds it already is buying, the central bank announced Monday.

As part of a continuing effort to support market functioning and ease credit conditions, the Fed added functions to its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility.

The program has the ability to buy up to $750 billion worth of corporate credit. Its March 23 initial announcement is largely considered a watershed announcement for the financial markets, reeling from the coronavirus threat spread.

Under the latest guidelines, the Fed said it will buy, on the secondary market, individual bonds that have remaining maturities of five years or less. Those purchases will go along with¬†the ETFs the Fed already has been buying, which are balanced towards investment-grade indexes but also include some junk bond funds that track debt which had been investment grade prior to the crisis but had been downgraded after.

The intent of the individual debt purchases will be ""to create a corporate bond portfolio that is based on a broad, diversified market index of U.S. corporate bonds,"" the Fed said in a news release.¬†

""This index is made up of all the bonds in the secondary market that have been issued by U.S. companies that satisfy the facility's minimum rating, maximum maturity, and other criteria. This indexing approach will complement the facility's current purchases of exchange-traded funds,"" the statement said.

Issuers must have been rated BBB- or /Baa3, depending on the agency, as of March 22, just before the Fed announced its credit facilities.¬†

Retail investors‚Äô favorite stocks are outperforming the picks of hedge funds during the market comeback, according to Goldman Sachs. 

Goldman compiled a portfolio of popular stocks among retail investors and the basket of equities is up 61% since the depths of the bear market in March. Goldman‚Äôs hedge fund basket is only up 45% in the same period. 

‚ÄúThe narrative of Main Street weakness vs. Wall Street asset inflation is misleading,‚Äù Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients.

Friday markets had a weak rally after Thursday's big selloff. The bulls failed to hold any gains and the **VIX** remained high.

Futures opened down and have dipped as much as 4%. 5% is limit down. Keep in mind a circuit breaker will trigger a 15-minute trading halt if the S&amp;P 500 drops 7% or move.

Bears appear to be firmly in charge as new virus cases are spiking across the country.

I'm looking for perfect setups only. My goal is to make money with the bulls and not let the bears take it away.

**WATCHLIST:**

**AWX** is a low float, resistance is at $2

**NETE** is a low float, watching for a setup above VWAP

**KIRK** is a low float, key level is at $1.75

**JAKK** is a low float, resistance at $1.40

**HGSH** is a low float, on watch

I'm a 30-year-old man who decided around May 1 it was time to finally do some investing. Since then I've managed to put a major chunk of my savings (about $10,000) into a VFIAX mutual fund.

It had reached a profit of nearly $600, but with last week's pullbacks I'm only up about $159.

My question: Should I pull my money out now and back into my Wells Fargo account and wait for the market to settle down?

I'm seeing articles saying that this could be a bad week, and futures numbers (which I don't completely understand the meaning of) are down big too. Even DDTG, who has been pretty positive throughout this, now seems on edge.

A combination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's pessimistic view of the economy and worry around a second COVID wave / lockdown put significant pressure on the markets. Are these concerns valid? Here are the details:

1. **On Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell laid out a prolonged picture of economic recovery after COVID.** While Powell stated interest rates will remain near zero and promised continued financial support, he projected a lengthy economic recovery. Powell expects average unemployment of \~10% during the last three months of the year vs. unemployment of 13.3% today. Furthermore, he expects GDP to contract by 5 - 10% this year. These estimates mean the expected monthly decreases in unemployment rates will be less than the 1.3% decrease we saw in May and unemployment to decrease at a slower rate while reopening ramps up.
2. **As states reopen, 21 states saw an increase in average daily new cases.**[ ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-economy-worst-of-coronavirus-shutdowns-may-be-over-11590408000)21 states saw an increase in COVID cases as they have begun reopening. Furthermore, hospitalizations have begun to rise in at least 9 states. However, COVID death are still declining steadily. We'll need to keep a close eye on whether the nation is able to continue this steady decline in COVID deaths following this recent increase in case counts. Continued decrease in COVID deaths will mean we are handling the new cases earlier and better.
3. **Economic recovery continues steadily with unemployment claims reports decreasing and consumer price index (CPI) improving.** This week, we saw signs of economic recovery as unemployment claims reports decreased by 335K, from 1.8M to 1.5M. Furthermore, CPI decreased by only 0.1% in May compared to 0.8% in April; if we look over the past 12 months, the CPI actually increased by 0.1%. Both indicators suggest the slowing of the economic contraction due to COVID. Furthermore, the CPI improvement indicates the Fed's current policy is working; generally, CPI decreases dramatically during recessions as consumers curtail their spending.

**WX Capital is maintaining its position in the market.** Powell's pessimistic economic sentiment and the rise in COVID cases are unfortunate, but not alarming. Looking ahead, we will be keeping a close eye on unemployment rates and COVID death rates, and gauging the market's reaction. As of now, May's increase in employment and the general trend in decreasing COVID deaths are promising signs of economic recovery.

My questions are in 2 areas: Stock Screener applications and Stock Charting applications. 


For those who use Stock Screener applications or websites:

:::1. What screener sites or apps do you use? 

:::2. Do you use a pre market screener as well as an intraday screener? Or just 1 screener for everything?

:::3. What are the filters you use? Are they different for pre market vs market hours? (By filters I mean short interest, volume and volume increase, % movement, gaps, etc.)


In regards stock charting applications:

:::1. What stock chart programs or apps allow you to overlay multiple graphs for specific stocks. I.E. overlay the closing price and the Book value of a stock. Or overlay the closing price and the EPS over a period of time. Or overlay say the closing price and the P/E? I'd like to be about to look at the correlations between the daily closing price of stocks and other rubrics in a visual chart form over a period of a year or 5 years or 10 years.

:::2. What program or app allows you to put two or more stocks together on a chart and then average the chart to show one single line which is the average of the two or more stocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Enjoy, and please give me your thoughts! I am especially interested in the Bear case for LUV and DAL. I do not have positions in any of these companies. 

*Introduction:*

As of this writing, while having bounced off the March lows in hopes of economic recovery and medical developments related to COVID-19 (along with potentially excitement by retail investors), all of the major US airlines still face major headwinds within the next few years which could affect their profitability or even their solvency. That said, I believe that some of the airlines may be a buy for a long term value investor if there is a near term dip in prices. This is my purely speculative opinion, and is not meant to be seen as a recommendation to buy any of these securities. If they pique your interest, this should be the start, not the end, of your research. 

The industry as a whole faces four pressures in my opinion. Firstly, there will be at least a short term halt in international travel, and potentially a long term shift away from international travel. There is also the potential for a long term shift in corporate travel trends with the advent of remote work. Even a small shift in corporate travel could affect airline profitability by a large margin. There will also be reduced capacity, which increases expenses, for at least the near term. Additionally given contracting economic conditions, there will likely be low fare pressure in the next few years. With this in mind, let‚Äôs analyze the Majors. I will analyze their businesses from a qualitative perspective and then estimate earnings growth using a conservative yet reasonable choice of growth rate of 9,5, and 3 year earnings or free cash growth rates to estimate share price 5 years into the future. I will then use this price to estimate the book value and margin of safety price for an investor looking for 15% YoY returns. 

*Southwest Airlines (Ticker: LUV):*

Southwest airlines is headed by CEO Gary C Kelly, who has been with the company since 1986 and is also President and Chairman of the Board. I believe that Southwest‚Äôs current leadership structure puts his incentives very much in line with the interest of shareholders, which I think is good for the long term investor, as I don‚Äôt see Kelly having any plans to leave anytime soon. In his letter to shareholders he discussed the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic and stated it was too early to offer full year guidance. That said, he was very optimistic about Southwest‚Äôs 2019 performance despite Boeing headwinds. He also has a focus throughout the letter about how Southwest succeeds due to its people, which I believe to be good leadership. 

Southwest faces the same challenges as most of the industry, along with the most headwinds due to the MAX groundings. Because LUV only runs Boeing 737 aircraft, it currently has 34 MAX 8‚Äôs that are grounded by the FAA. That said, given the current demand headwinds, this may be a blessing in disguise. They proved in 2019 their ability to operate profitably despite reduced capacity with the MAX groundings. Additionally, in the face of industry headwinds, LUV has distinct advantages over the competition. Firstly, they have a strong balance sheet with a BBB+ credit rating from S&amp;P. This will allow them to stay solvent during the current crisis, and allow them the ability to have less impeded growth after these headwinds clear up. On top of the strength of their balance sheet, LUV has service advantages that play to the current environment, including their minimal exposure to international travel and their ability to profit and attract customers with their low fares and exceptional service. Because they only fly Boeing 737 aircraft, the company is able to keep costs low and fares lower than the competition, in an industry that is highly competitive and now faces more low fare pressure than ever. 

*Earnings Estimate:*

The most conservative growth rate for LUV is the 3 year earnings growth rate of 7%. Based on this growth rate and 2019‚Äôs annual EPS I estimate that EPS for 2025-2026 should be $5.99 per share. Using a PE ratio of 14 (twice the estimated growth rate) this would mean the share price in 2026 would be $83.84 per share. This means that for an investor looking for 15% YoY growth, the book value would be $41.69. I estimate a margin of safety price at half of the book value, or $20.84. That said, given the qualitative analysis, I believe LUV is a safe buy at \~$25 a share. 

*Delta Airlines (Ticker: DAL):*

Delta‚Äôs CEO is Edward H Bastian, and he is the first Delta CEO ever hired from within the company and has done two stints with the company. I believe given this he does have the businesses best interest in mind, and that he is good management. His letter to shareholders is also evidence of this, noting that the company‚Äôs response to COVID-19 involves 3 things: Taking care of their people and customers, preserving liquidity, and positioning for recovery. I believe he is positioned as CEO to lead the company through the current crisis.

Delta‚Äôs service has an expansive global network of over 50 countries and focuses on premium services so they can reduce reliance on price sensitive segments. ‚Öì of their revenues come from premium products. They are a well known brand, especially among business travelers. Their heavy exposure to corporate travel and premium fares worries me in the current environment due to the potential long term shift away from these services. Their international travel segment also concerns me. That said, Delta has a solid balance sheet, having a credit rating of BBB- prior to the current crisis. This has since been downgraded below investment grade, but I still believe that they are positioned to survive the crisis. They also own a large amount of their fleet, and the planes they are leasing are older and could be retired, which is much more financially sustainable for the business. They also have zero exposure to the Boeing MAX issues, which is a positive. 

*Earnings Estimate:*

To estimate, I used the very conservative 5 year Free Cash flow growth rate of 5%, placing earnings at $9.32 per share in 2026. Using a PE ratio of twice the growth rate, or 10, this makes future share price $93.17, meaning for a value investor looking for 15% YoY return the book value would be slightly below pre-pandemic pricing at $46.32 a share, with a margin of safety at $23.16. However I am slightly more optimistic and once again rate the shares as a buy at a price of around $25 a share. 

*United Airlines (Ticker: UAL):*

United is led by new CEO and former president Scott Kirby. This is after Ocar Munoz, well known for his PR debacle amid the removal of a passenger from an overbooked flight, was named Chairman of the board and left the CEO position. Kirby is not a mercenary and has worked in the airline industry since 1995, working for United since 2016. That said this switch of leadership in the middle of the current crisis concerns me. It also concerned me that Munoz‚Äôs letter to shareholders didn‚Äôt have a single substantial thing to say.  

In terms of service, United transports passengers across North America and 6 other continents, using a hub and spoke system to keep costs lower and reach more destinations. They also have a focus on their business and premium cabin customers. All of this amounts to large downside risk and the near and long term future with the changes to international and business travel. Additionally, they have 14 Boeing MAX planes, and a less strong balance sheet, with a BB credit rating prior to the crisis. On the upside, they did hit records in 2019 with EPS and Pre-tax margins growth and the directors are doing the right thing by waiving most or all of their salaries in the current climate. 

*Earnings Estimate:*

Given my bearishness on United, I used the very conservative 3 year revenue growth rate of 4% to estimate future earnings of $14.09 in 2025 - 2026. Using the PE multiple of 8, I estimate the share price of UAL to be $112.71 in 2025-2026. For the value investor with a 15% return target, this gives a sticker price of $56.04 and a margin of safety of $28.02 a share. Given its current valuation I do not rate it as a buy, but given that it is slightly under my estimated sticker price I recommend it as a hold. 

*American Airlines:*

American Airlines CEO Doug Parker has done two stints with the company from 1986-1991 and then from 2012 to now. While he isn‚Äôt a mercenary, I don‚Äôt know that he is a very good leader of the company based on his track record. 

American faces significant financial headwinds that may make solvency difficult for them. American has high levels of debt with a B- credit rating from S&amp;P, making it hard for them to acquire more liquidity to navigate the current crisis.In fact, they have had negative shareholder equity since 2017. Additionally, they have a high exposure to international and corporate travel like much of the other majors and have 24 grounded MAX aircraft, the second most of any major. On the upside, American does have a younger, more fuel efficient fleet than its peers if it is able to survive its current problems. That said, the younger fleet often brings in other financial issues associated with leasing newer aircraft. 

*Earnings Estimate:* 

Given American‚Äôs negative historical growth rates for earnings and equity I use what I believe to be the very liberal 3 year revenue growth rate of 4%. This would be *the most optimistic scenario*. In this case, this would give a future earnings of $4.61 per share for 2025-2026, with a future share price based on a liberal PE multiple of 8 of $36.89. This gives the company a book value of $18.34 per share and a margin of safety at $9.17 for an investor with a 15% YoY returns target. This is an extremely optimistic scenario in which shareholders are not wiped out in bankruptcy or a merger. Even in this extremely optimistic case I rate the shares as a strong sell, trading at nearly their most optimistic book value. 

*TL;DR:*

The Major US airlines all face headwinds but might be worth a look for a long term value investor. Based on a time horizon of 5 years both LUV and DAL are a buy if they dip down to $25 a share in the near term, while UAL is a hold at current and likely near term prices. AAL faces severe headwinds and is a strong sell at its current price.

What is happening? Are they delisting completely from NYSE? Will they be on 2 exchanges? I can‚Äôt grasp any of this.

I‚Äôm new to the trading scene. About a month ago I decided to invest in JD.com. I had some Ali Baba stock, but figured I‚Äôd go with a cheaper rival.

I bought 50 shares at about $56.00 (which at the time was its all time high üôÑ). This represents about 1/3 of my portfolio. It started to drop due to US/CHINA tensions. I immediately regretted my decision.

Then news of a second listing came forth. The stock began to rise. To me, opening another listing seemed like bad news, but it has been rising steadily. It finally passed my break even point and beyond. 

I‚Äôve read that Ali Baba has also raised money from the Hong Kong exchange and everyone is all about Ali Baba. NetEase just paved the way. Now they are saying JD may be the biggest IPO so far this year? Aren‚Äôt they saying that the IPO will give Hong Kong investors a 2/1 share value of each stock with a slightly smaller cost?

Is this good or bad for me? What is going to happen to my shares? After the Thursday decline, I‚Äôm worried it will drop below my break even. The June 18th timeline is approaching and I don‚Äôt want to make a mistake. I already invested too much of my portfolio into this stock on a whim. It seems like it may deliver, but I don‚Äôt know what happens next.

Can someone drop some knowledge on my rookie ass? Did I make a mistake? Did I luck into a winner? Is it all hyped up for nothing?

Any help is appreciated. Good luck out there. Hope this week is great to us all.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with the recent publicity this way getting, I decided to take a quick look at it and see if there was any substance behind the rise in Hertz after bankruptcy. [As I‚Äôm writing, HTZ is trading at $2.83, giving it a market cap of $403mm.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/HTZ:US) I‚Äôm assuming that the bankruptcy continues and the following is a liquidation view of the stock. Under Chapter 11, the company hopes to continue its operations at a reduced scale. During proceedings, shareholders are last in line to receive anything from the bankruptcy, after secured and unsecured creditors.

[Off the most recent 10-Q:](http://ir.hertz.com/sec-filings)

Assets:

There was $1 billion in cash

There was $2 billion in receivables.

There were $14.3 billion of cars which will be sold off. 

Liabilities that have to be paid off before shareholders get anything:

There‚Äôs $14 billion of secured debt used to purchase the cars (almost exactly the same as value of the actual cars)

There are $4 billion of bonds, and let‚Äôs say $2 billion of other unsecured liabilities.

There are continuing operating costs despite no revenue after the 10-Q due to the lockdown, and also costs throughout bankruptcy.

So now let‚Äôs add up all the assets and see what the shareholder will end up with:

It‚Äôs likely any flood of used cars into the marketplace will depress prices significantly and make the $14 billion unrealistic to achieve. For the sake of the HTZ holders, I‚Äôm going to assume that they get the full sum, which completely pays off the secured debt.

It‚Äôs difficult to judge what operating costs they‚Äôve had, since they‚Äôve cut operations at the same time as revenue dried up due to the pandemic. For the sake of simplicity, let‚Äôs say the costs this quarter cancel out the cash on hand completely, and the accounts payable cancel with the accounts receivable.

The costs of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a company this size are massive, and will likely cost the entirety of the capital raise ‚Äì if it is successful.

So now, we have: 

$4 billion of bonds that need to be paid off before the shareholder STARTS to get anything out of the company. This is backed up by the bond yields before the whole massive explosion started, where they yielded in a range from 20-25%.

So essentially, the long thesis on Hertz right now is that Hertz have undervalued their used cars by a considerable margin; the smaller, reorganised Hertz will be extremely successful at creating cashflow in the future while starting with no assets (and no debt).",,,,,,,,,,,,

***These securities are currently undervalued according to recent oversold trends combined with recent steady growth***

Recent reports speculated that cannabis will be a major key in the future debt crisis and fast tracking legalization is now on the table.

The cannabis sector fell an average of 15% to 30% loss Thursday while only recouping an average of 5% gain on Friday. This leaves 10% to 25% minimal returns early this week.

Edit: (from indexes). They've been in financial trouble for ages but I took a gamble because 1. Liberal government loves to bail them out, and 2. The sell-offs of their other businesses to focus on private jets seemed to me like what they needed to rebuild. I figured for a 3-5 year investment they might become cashflow positive and turn things around.. unfortunately covid hit the aircraft industry like a ton of bricks so this delisting is likely the first sign of bankruptcy for Bombardier. True, private jets aren't passenger jets and there's likely still a market especially with military.. but I suspect they're gonna be back to selling skidoos in the coming years and selling off all assets. If they even make it through. 


Edit: they're still trading on TSX.

Should I sell on OTCBB/Pink Sheets or just hold and pray they get relisted and explode. (When I say explode I mean back to $2-$3/share lol). They were one of the most traded stocks on TSX before they got delisted. Their stock grew to $0.67/share and I genuinely thought we might witness a miracle story.

# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.
*****
&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. 
*****
&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. 
*****
&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed‚Äôs bond buying and other policy moves.
*****
&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday‚Äôs sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,‚Äù said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies‚Äô stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it‚Äôs a contrarian warning.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúHistorically that‚Äôs just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,‚Äù he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.
*****
&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy‚Äôs reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,‚Äù said Stovall.  
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. ‚ÄúThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,‚Äù said Stovall. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.‚Äù
*****
&gt; # Consumer barometer
&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.
*****
&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday‚Äôs report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.
*****
&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April‚Äôs depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.
*****
&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,‚Äù notes Zandi. ‚ÄúOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead 
&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the cat‚Äôs out of the bag. I don‚Äôt think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he‚Äôs got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can‚Äôt do it on his own,‚Äù said Zandi. ‚ÄúHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He‚Äôs speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed‚Äôs balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,‚Äù  said Zandi. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs strongly suggesting there‚Äôs going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He‚Äôs going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs going to more clearly define the amount of QE they‚Äôre doing going forward. He‚Äôll try to preserve some optionality, but he‚Äôll try to make it known, they‚Äôre buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,‚Äù Zandi said.
*****
&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be surprised if there‚Äôs a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,‚Äù Briggs said.

# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?

&gt; ‚ÄúStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.‚Äù ‚Äî Old investment axiom

&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We‚Äôve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.

&gt; ‚ÄúIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we‚Äôve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we‚Äôve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We‚Äôve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn‚Äôt always a bad thing.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn‚Äôt always a bad thing for the bulls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.

# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment

&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today‚Äôs market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.

&gt; This is still the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the ‚ÄúBest Six Months‚Äù (November-April) as they were in 2020, the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.

&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year‚Äôs negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.

&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.

&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell‚Äôs candor and reserved outlook at yesterday‚Äôs press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.

&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the ‚ÄúPulse of the Market‚Äù hit 0.43 last week ‚Äì its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor‚Äôs Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.

&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**

&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:

&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.

# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond

&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.

&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.

I actually bought a ton of RL after the recent crash but I‚Äôm wondering if GES is a better pick simply due to the observation that if both go back to pre-pandemic prices, GES will have rebounded much more. Year to date RL is down 37 % and GES is down 56 %. 

On the other hand, based on fundamentals and everything one would normally look at but which seems to not really apply to these crazy times we‚Äôre in, I have more faith in RL. The mere fact that it hasn‚Äôt dropped as much as GES should also be an indicator of healthier financials. RL seems to be good at controlling debt and it was on an uptrend prior to the pandemic (as was GES). 

I know I should consider cash flow, balance sheet, debt and so forth and I have, somewhat, but it also just seems obvious that RL scores higher than GES in that regard because as I said it hasn‚Äôt tanked as much.

The goal of this post is to cover what you should take into consideration while managing risk and cutting losses on a trade. If you think that you don't need to focus much on cutting losses and can simply hold until the stock bounces back... the market has just yet to humble you! 

That trading style is how you end up *""bag holding.""* A **bag holder** is someone that holds onto a loss for as long as it takes for the stock to bounce back enough for them to get out at breakeven or even a profit. However, they don't always bounce back so bag holding is not a trading style used by successful, consistently profitable traders. Even when the stock does bounce back and the trader gets to exit at breakeven instead of taking a loss, you should still consider how much opportunity was lost while the money was tied up in a losing position! Simply put, when you're bag holding you can't put your money to work in the market on better trade setups and miss out of potential profits.

So how do you avoid this? *Simple.* **Cut losses!** I know... easier said than done, but it's crucial for long-term success in the market. You have to just *""rip the bandaid off""* and move on from the long trade. After all, even the best of the best don't trade with 100% accuracy.

The price level you use to cut your losses is actually something you should know of before even entering the trade. This risk level should be part of your trade plan and can be found using some very basic technical analysis. One of the key point made when talking about a level of support is the fact that if a stock breaks below support, it is likely to continue lower until new support is met or formed *(assuming it's not a* *false breakdown)*. For that reason, you can use a level of support not only to buy in hopes that the stock will once again bounce from that price, but also as a risk level in case it does not.

[https://imgur.com/a/pjKkDx0](https://imgur.com/a/pjKkDx0) 

Before setting your risk level to cut losses directly at nearest support level though, keep in mind the possibility of the stock returning to support or even very briefly dipping slightly below support before bouncing back up. In that case, you would end up cutting losses at the worst possible time and would be taking an unnecessary loss. To avoid that from happening, try setting your risk level somewhere between 2% and 8% below the nearest support. I know that's a fairly large range, but it really depends on your personal risk tolerance and the volatility of the individual stock that you're trading.

For example, you may want to give a highly volatile small cap stock a bit more wiggle room before cutting losses than a less volatile blue chip stock to avoid getting faked out. You can then use this risk level level to figure out your ideal **position size** as well. if you happen to be trading a more volatile stock and decide to set you risk level 6% below support, you'd probably be better off buying a smaller position than if you were only risking 2% below support with a more stable stock.

[https://imgur.com/a/5uRmWy1](https://imgur.com/a/5uRmWy1) 

All of these factors should really be tied together and should be a part of your trade plan that you create before you even open your position. By having a trade plan and knowing exactly what to do when the stock reaches a certain price, you can take a lot of the emotion out of your trading and focus on the price action and your strategy!

This is a huge advantage because being able to control your emotions while trading is one of the most difficult aspects of successful trading. If this is something that you struggle with, you may want to consider trying different order types to automatically cut losses for your, rather than having to manually sell your shares once the stock falls to your risk level. There are three main types of stop-loss order that will do this for you.

**1. Stop on Quote:** A stop on quote order will turn into a market order to sell your shares immediately when your selected price level is hit. For example, you set a stop on quote order at $1.79, the price falls to $1.79, and your shares are sold at the market. This means that you may not be able to sell all of your shares at $1.79 if there aren't a sufficient amount of share being bought at $1.79. In that case, the rest of your share may be sold at $1.78, $1.77, $1.76, etc.

**2. Stop Limit on Quote:** This order type type is almost identical to the stop on quote order. The only difference is that this becomes a limit order o sell your share once your price level is hit, rather than a market order. For example, you could set a quote price of $2.00 and a limit price of $1.98. In this case, if the stock price fell to $2.00 and activated your limit order, you know that your shares will be sold for at least $1.98 (if not higher). If this was a market order, you could end up selling some at $1.97, $1.96, $1.95, etc. The only downfall of a stop limit on quote order is the fact that you may not be able to sell all of your shares at your selected limited price if there isn't volume at that price to purchase your shares. For that reason, it's fairly important to give your limit order some space, rather than setting it directly below the quote price that will activate it.

**3. Trailing % Stop on Quote:** This order type is meant to protect your profits on a trade and keep you from allowing a winning trade to turn into a losing trade. With this order type you have to select a % in which you want the stock price to be trailed. If you were to put 5% and the stock went directly down after you bought, this order would turn to a stop on quote order and sell your shares at the market once the price went down 5%. However, if the stock first went up 5% before coming down 5%, you would be selling at breakeven, because the order trailed the price of the stock when it initially went up 5%. Personally, I never use this order type and recommend most traders to stick to a basic stop order to cut losses if they choose not to do it manually, because you almost have to set your trailing stop at the perfect percentage in order to really take advantage of it and not get stopped out on the stock's dips and pullbacks.

Regardless of the order type used, what's most important is that you're actively cutting losses when need be! Hopefully this post emphasizes the importance of managing risk and gave you some ideas of how you can properly do so.",self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '2npif6amJpA0XbdyYRoyp-twbAjzakE-jRfJUKfr8hY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Rqui0lBBClhZZ5zO4V0n3m_3xrBQkm48f3eKiVGUk5I.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c3d05d7a210569d77eee60f9e88231f20f60c9c', 'width': 108}, {'height': 120, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Rqui0lBBClhZZ5zO4V0n3m_3xrBQkm48f3eKiVGUk5I.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f61af83b5c0d35f02f8ca24067992a3b4d2110f1', 'width': 216}, {'height': 178, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Rqui0lBBClhZZ5zO4V0n3m_3xrBQkm48f3eKiVGUk5I.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ceb78b804bed57cf28cf40727d2c84585cebab0', 'width': 320}, {'height': 357, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Rqui0lBBClhZZ5zO4V0n3m_3xrBQkm48f3eKiVGUk5I.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e211e7b81e7bf2e7ae7c69df2aefbff16b8b4ecd', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 518, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Rqui0lBBClhZZ5zO4V0n3m_3xrBQkm48f3eKiVGUk5I.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6bc13f657998e056dd279443d4b839a816a1638c', 'width': 928}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

I'm not singling out RH, there are many others out there.. Revolut, Trading212, Moneybox, Degrio (EU only)... But the one thing they offer is the ability to BUY stocks.

I do wonder though, if they had the ability to short stock (for the new investor: this means you borrow money, sell the stock (because you think the price is going down), then buy it back cheaper if you're right, effectively profiting on the gap between the price you sold it for and the cheaper price you paid to buy it back), then how many of the new retail mobile users would have decided to short stock instead of buy??

I can't help but think the rally was part due to platforms allowing users to make one-way bets on the direction of the market. I'm sure many out there would have sold $Htz if they could, but as they were given the option to buy the stock, that's what happened.

Many professional investors will tend to run a long/short portfolio to trade both ways. The closest these news platforms come to hedging is allowing users to buy into inverse funds, or go long on commodity trackers like gold. This should have a similar counterbalance effect in the event of the market turning, however the ability to short stock shouldn't be discounted.

                      *KEY POINTS* 

‚Ä¢ Stocks plummet due to concerns of second wave of Covid-19 across the US

‚Ä¢ All sectors were affected in the down trend (with very few exceptions)

‚Ä¢ Major US states including Texas, North Carolina, California, Arizona, Alaska, Kentucky, Oregon, and more report increase in Covid-19 cases

‚Ä¢ Cannabis sector widely speculated as possible fast track way to increase lost revenue from Covid-19 short term

‚Ä¢ Travel sector rapidly sells off in fear of cash burn which can unavoidably lead to chapter 11 bankruptcy short term. Creating a buy opportunity due to gathered 30% to 40% losses in share price drop this past week only to rebound 10% to 20% on Friday

‚Ä¢ Feds show no sign of raising interest rates during this weeks news briefing 

‚Ä¢ Resistance shown Friday afternoon combined with oversold and over bought trends historically points in the direction of a steady incline over the course of the next 1-2 weeks

‚Ä¢ Italy, Jamaica, Bulgaria, Portugal, Germany, Greece, including many other locations are opened back up for travel with minor regulations 

Attractive tickers this week include:

$BA, $BUD, $HEXO, $UAL, $DAL, $LUV, $AMC, $AAL, $VFF, $OGI, $CCL, $GE, $GNK, $TAP, $CRON, $EMAN, $OPES

June 12,2020  10:37 PM ET (MarketWatch)

By Howard Gold, MarketWatch

Robinhood and day-trading newbies already are getting their comeuppance

In 1929, the story goes, Joseph P. Kennedy, patriarch of the Kennedy clan, went for a shoeshine not far from his Wall Street office. Kennedy was stunned when the shoeshine man gave stock tips to him, a leading trader. He immediately returned to his office and aggressively short-sold stocks, making a fortune in the Great Crash.

This is probably an apocryphal tale that points to a larger truth: When even shoeshine men are so confident in their bullishness they give stock tips to the pros, it's time to run for the hills.

This week we've seen plenty of signs of this. As the Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs, briefly closing above 10,000 (nearly double its bubble top from the year 2000), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 both came within shouting distance of their February record peaks, day traders and newbies emerged, proclaiming their stock-picking genius.

This testosterone-driven overconfidence -- and research shows men are more reckless investors than women ([https://business.rice.edu/wisdom/peer-reviewed-research/investing-behavior-differences-men-and-women](https://business.rice.edu/wisdom/peer-reviewed-research/investing-behavior-differences-men-and-women)) -- has been most pronounced on Robinhood, the commission-free stock trading app preferred by millennials who can make all the trades they want at the tap of their thumbs.

The tale of Robinhood-

According to Crunchbase, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based brokerage has raised $1.2 billion altogether. On the strength of three million new customers in the first quarter, it just raised $280 million in a late funding round led by Silicon Valley heavyweight Sequoia Capital. Robinhood has more than 10 million customers ([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/robinhood-traders-cash-in-on-the-market-comeback-that-billionaire-investors-missed.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/robinhood-traders-cash-in-on-the-market-comeback-that-billionaire-investors-missed.html)) whose average age is 31.

It has been having an outsized impact on stock trading. An analyst at Deutsche Bank recently examined Robinhood trading data and found that small investors were behind much of the recent buying ([https://nypost.com/2020/06/10/small-investors-with-stimulus-funds-drive-post-coronavirus-surge](https://nypost.com/2020/06/10/small-investors-with-stimulus-funds-drive-post-coronavirus-surge)/) in the stock market, so that what we used to call the ""smart money"" is ""now chasing"" the day traders. Talk about the caboose pulling the train!

Gone are the days of COVID-19 lock-downs and fears of bodies piling up in emergency rooms. Long forgotten are the 40 million unemployed Americans, the 40% of businesses that may not reopen and the ""long road"" to recovery that a gloomy Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell laid out in his news conference Wednesday. And don't even think about the new wave of Corona-virus cases and hospitalizations we're seeing in at least a dozen U.S. states. Oh, no, instead the day traders are sampling and remixing those hits of the 1930s, ""We're in the Money"" and ""Happy Days Are Here Again.""

And these mini-Masters of the Universe aren't just buying the Apples (AAPL) and Teslas (TSLA) of the world; they're gobbling up stocks of bankrupt companies like Hertz (HTZ) and those whose businesses are in deep trouble, like American Airlines Group (AAL). Both of those stocks and others beaten down badly in the Corona-virus bear market have rallied sharply over the past few weeks.

Better than Buffett?

No doubt these very astute people have done deep dives into balance sheets, loan covenants and capital structures the way distressed debt and deep value investors do to make sure they're protected on the downside. Oh, wait. Screw the guardrails. Damn the torpedoes. Traders on Robinhood and other instant-trading platforms are wagering hundreds maybe a few thousand bucks at a time and are beating the pants off the pros.

One leading day trader who's particularly proud of himself is Dave Portnoy, the successful founder of Barstool Sports, who thinks his prowess over the last, oh, six weeks or so, has made him better than ... Warren Buffett.

""I'm the new breed. I'm the new generation,"" he crowed ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffett-is-an-idiot-says-investor-who-claims-daytrading-is-the-easiest-game-ive-ever-played-2020-06-09](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffett-is-an-idiot-says-investor-who-claims-daytrading-is-the-easiest-game-ive-ever-played-2020-06-09)). ""There's nobody who can argue that Warren Buffett is better at the stock market than I am right now. I'm better than he is. That's a fact.""

This column has recently taken Buffett to task ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dud-stock-picks-bad-industry-bets-vast-underperformance-its-the-end-of-the-warren-buffett-era-2020-05-14](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dud-stock-picks-bad-industry-bets-vast-underperformance-its-the-end-of-the-warren-buffett-era-2020-05-14)) for his performance over the past decade. Three of his recent investments lost at least $7 billion, and he clearly sold airline stocks at the bottom ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-warren-buffett-made-a-huge-mistake-selling-his-airline-stocks-2020-05-26](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-warren-buffett-made-a-huge-mistake-selling-his-airline-stocks-2020-05-26)). But really, Dave, really? He sounds like he's auditioning to host a revival of ""The Apprentice.""

The day trading is definitely a sign of the times. As Anthony Denier, CEO of trading platform Webull, told the New York Post: ""We're all home. Some people are making bread, and some are saying, 'Hey, how can I make the stock market work for me?' And with the Fed \[pumping money\] into the markets, they're thinking 'How can I lose?' ""

How? Let me count the ways, starting with today, with the Dow down 1,862 points, the biggest drop since the dark days of March. Who knows if this is profit taking or whether we're heading for another leg down in stocks? But some of us remember the 1990s, the days of theglobe.com and ""boot your broker"" and guys in their basements trading Yahoo stock dozens of times a day. You can ""OK boomer"" me all you want, but I've seen this movie many times and it never has a happy ending.

I recently started an investment portfolio. I'm going long-term, and I am preparing to make monthly contributions. 

I'm looking for wisdom and/or input on the psychology/mindset of WHEN to buy. Considering I'm looking at a 10-15 year timeline, I can't imagine that waiting 2-3 weeks matters too much (save a major crash), and clearly waiting could hurt. However, I can't convince myself to ""go in,"" as I keep telling myself that waiting until another dip would probably let me scoop up a few extra shares. 

The best I've got is to just wait until a red day and JUMP. Is it really that simple? Would love some input on how you all approach this and get yourself moving.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The company has two clinical stage drugs, ARV-110 and ARV-471, for prostate cancer and breast cancer. Recent Phase 1 data from ARV-110 was received negatively and drove a \~40% drop in the stock, but we believe the data actually shows proof-of-concept for Arvinas‚Äô platform and the recent weakness in the stock presents a significant buying opportunity. **Our valuation yields a per share value of $50, implying close to 60% upside from \~$30 today.**

**Key Takeaways**

* Arvinas‚Äô PROTAC protein degradation technology is a unique, highly differentiated drug platform with therapeutic potential in numerous protein-driven disease areas including oncology and neurology. The PROTAC platform has the potential to quickly develop drugs that hit existing protein targets harder than traditional inhibitors do as well as address previously undruggable proteins.
* Arvinas has two drugs in the clinic: ARV-110 for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and ARV-471 for metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer; both are in Phase 1 development and have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for their respective diseases.
* As of 1Q20, Arvinas had $260M of cash as of 1Q20, expected to be sufficient to fund operations into 2022.
* Though the stock has now dropped close to 40% since initial ARV-110 Phase 1 data was first released in mid-May, we believe this was a knee-jerk reaction that ignores the proof-of-concept demonstrated by the data. The data showed evidence of PROTAC-directed degradation of AR, signals of clinical efficacy, as well as a generally favorable safety profile that we believe should be viewed as encouraging signs.
* With the stock now at $33, we are positive on Arvinas‚Äô risk-reward heading into additional data readouts in 2H20. These include additional ARV-110 Phase 1 data and first-in-human data from ARV-471, both of which should be major stock-moving events. Based on our valuation (described in detail further down) of $50/share using conservative estimates, we see the recent weakness in the stock as an attractive entry point to potentially capture 60% upside.

**Details**

**Arvinas‚Äô PROTAC technology is a differentiated protein degradation platform with therapeutic potential in multiple disease areas.**

* PROTAC, short for proteolysis targeting chimeras, takes advantage of the body‚Äôs natural protein disposal system to selectively degrade proteins involved in disease. A key player in this process is the E3 ligase, an enzyme that naturally identifies mutated/misfolded proteins and tags them with a protein called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin-tagged proteins are then naturally recognized by a complex called the proteasome that degrades them into their constituent peptides.
* Arvinas‚Äô PROTAC molecules are designed to recruit a specific E3 ligase (there are over 600 types) to a specified target protein and tag it for degradation. After degradation, the ubiquitin and PROTAC are recycled and can continue to recruit and tag target proteins. This focus on matching ligands to proteins could also confer advantages in development speed, as Arvinas could potentially target different proteins with the same ligase, eliminating the need to design a completely new molecule. The general process is visually outlined below (diagram from Arvinas poster publication).
* Compared to typical drugs that only inhibit the activity of mutated proteins, a protein degradation approach could have several advantages. First, completely eliminating mutated proteins through degradation could confer greater therapeutic benefit versus inhibition alone. Moreover, in preclinical testing, PROTACs have shown the ability to distinguish between wild-type (unmutated) protein and proteins with single point mutations (e.g. WT BRAF vs. BRAF V600E), suggesting a high degree of selectivity. Finally, PROTACs do not need to bind as strongly to target proteins as much as inhibitors do in order to take effect, so they can potentially interact with and tag previously ‚Äúundruggable‚Äù proteins. As up to \~80% of known proteins are considered ‚Äúundruggable‚Äù by traditional inhibitory drugs, PROTAC could be a paradigm-shifting technology in cancer and beyond.
* Arvinas is exploring PROTAC‚Äôs therapeutic potential in multiple disease areas, starting with oncology. Moreover, preclinical data has suggested that PROTACs can cross the blood-brain barrier, which if true, would make them ideal for targeting all sorts of proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease including Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs.
* Arvinas has signed collaboration agreements with Bayer, Genentech, and Pfizer to develop drugs based on PROTAC.

**Arvinas is testing ARV-110 in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a patient population with a dire need for improved treatment options.**

* Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent cancer and second leading cause of death for men in the US (an estimated 33,000 deaths are expected in 2020), with an estimated 1 in 9 men experiencing prostate cancer in their lifetime.
* The overexpression of androgen receptor (AR) is a known driver of prostate cancer, and current standard of care targets AR using drugs including enzalutamide and abiraterone in combination with chemotherapy. However, up to 25% of patients never respond to these treatments, and the vast majority of patients will eventually progress to a castration-resistant state, necessitating the need for a new treatment modality.
* ARV-110 is designed to facilitate the degradation of AR and has shown the ability to inhibit tumor growth 70-100% in enzalutamide-resistant mouse models. Initial in-human safety data released in October also showed promise, with no dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related adverse events in 10 patients who had been on treatment for a month. Expanded Phase 1 data is discussed below.

**ARV-471 has shown potential in metastatic ER+ breast cancer.**

* ARV-471 is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that uses the PROTAC platform to, as the name suggests, selectively target estrogen receptors for degradation. ARV-471 is currently in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial for ER+ breast cancer, and initial results reported in October 2019 showed that patients had drug exposure levels in the predicted efficacious range with no dose limiting toxicities. Expanded results on safety/efficacy are expected by YE20.

**Phase 1 ARV-110 data was viewed as underwhelming but still showed proof-of-concept, and the stock overreaction creates an attractive entry point.**

* Arvinas‚Äô Phase 1 trial for ARV-110 is a dose escalation study testing doses of 35mg up to 420mg in third-line mCRPC patients with the primary endpoint of identifying a Phase 2 dose and secondary endpoint of assessing early safety/efficacy data.
* Arvinas disclosed first-in-human data for ARV-110 at ASCO on May 29. The data was perceived as disappointing, driving the stock down as much as 30%, with only 2/12 patients (17%) at the 140mg dose showing responses (no responses were observed at the lower doses).
* However, we don‚Äôt think the data is quite as bad as the market‚Äôs reaction suggests. Of the 12 patients dosed at 140mg, 5 had mutations that made them unlikely to respond to ARV-110; excluding these patients bumps up the response rate to 2/7 (29%). Arvinas could (and should) screen for these mutations in future trials to enroll a more selective patient population more likely to respond to the drug. Importantly, both responders had mutations known to drive resistance to mCRPC standard of care, an encouraging sign for ARV-110‚Äôs potential in 3L patients.
* Nevertheless, despite our optimistic take on the data, it is too early to make meaningful conclusions about ARV-110‚Äôs efficacy, and there are still outstanding questions about ARV-110 that place increased emphasis on the expanded Phase 1 data readout (expected by YE20). These include whether ARV-110 can show a dose dependent response at the higher 240mg and 480mg doses, as well as if additional responses will occur and if current responses will deepen or be sustained.

**Valuation**

* We arrive at a $50/share value for Arvinas using a sum-of-the-parts analysis. Our valuation assumes a launch year of 2024 for ARV-110 (35% Probability of Success or POS) and 2025 for ARV-471 (20% POS), with each respectively reaching unadjusted peak sales of \~$900M and \~$1.4B four years post-launch. We use a 6.5x peak sales multiple for both assets and a discount rate of 12%.
* We did not assign value to Arvinas‚Äô undisclosed preclinical oncology assets or its early-stage neurology pipeline, but they represent possible upside.

**Key Risks**

* **Clinical/regulatory failure.** Arvinas is exposed to the same set of clinical and regulatory risks as many of its biotech peers. This risk is particularly relevant for Arvinas and its novel PROTAC platform, and Phase 1 data from ARV-110 and ARV-471 will be crucial in legitimizing PROTAC‚Äôs mechanism of action, both for Arvinas‚Äô commercial prospects in oncology as well as future drugs based on PROTAC. Future risks include negative regulatory feedback from the FDA or problems in the execution of manufacturing/commercialization activities.
* **Competitive risk.** Protein degradation is not an approach unique to Arvina; there are multiple companies pursuing protein degradation such as private companies C4 Therapeutics and Kymera Therapeutics as well as larger biopharmas including Roche, Amgen, and Novartis. However, it is too early to draw any conclusions about any company‚Äôs technology as Arvinas is the first of these companies with in-human data and remains the tone setter for the entire field as its trials progress. Beyond protein degradation, there is also the risk that ARV-110/ARV-471, if approved, do not experience the commercial success that we expect due to competing therapies on the market.

**This Sunday evening, 6/14/2020 at 7PM ET** I'm going to do something a little different for a livestream. For those who don't know, outside of trading I also build financial webapps and tools. Primarily I code in Python and Django and I use React for front end development. So this week one of the ideas that came up in our discord channel was the idea of live-coding something to show how I use market data APIs and Python to build really cool stuff that I use in my trading.

It won't be super advanced since we will only have about 30-45 minutes of coding time, and I don't know exactly what I'll be building yet, but it will most likely be something that grabs some stock information from a free API and tinkers around with it. To be honest even though I've been a developer for a while at this point, I'm self taught in that field and I've never done a live coding stream before so this might be a total disaster, but if that's the case it will be even more entertaining to watch!

If you're a developer or even just interested in seeing how I use market data and Python to build things that I use in my trading, you won't want to miss it. I'm really excited to get out of my comfort zone a bit and do something different. And on that note, if anyone wants to share ideas of something you'd like to see me (attempt to) build, comment here and maybe I'll do one of your ideas!

As always I'll share my screen, stream it live on Twitch in the [#twitch_stream](https://discord.com/channels/516531977080406026/625750328108908564) channel and record it and upload it to YouTube afterwards in the [#archived_streams](https://discord.com/channels/516531977080406026/645651453788160040) channel in case you can't make it.

Please be gentle as I am a noob :-)

I have been a long time Forex trader and long-term stock trader since around 2004. Until very recently I had never really paid attention to stock Day Trading. During Covid shut down I got bored and fell madly in love with pre-market buying and selling a few hrs into the market opening or when the stock declined $0.10 in 1 min. I use tons of alerts with various sounds for price drops of more than $0.02 and I get SMS when it hits $0.09 drop in 1 min. Sometimes I make as low as $0.25 a share and a few times as much as $7 in per share profit. Seems mostly I range between $0.50 - $1.25 in per share profit. I only trade 2-4 stocks per day.

Finviz, Benzinga, BamSEC, Smarttrader, and thinkorswim are my main tools. I have a range of criteria I use to choose stocks. Some of the stuff I look for is trend-line, support and resistance, volume at closing, stock price must be over $1. Then news, SEC filings and a few other important elements that help me select a stock.

I have completed about 48 days of actual trading in this manner. I have lost about 8% of my total profits and that was simply because I was still learning how to manage reversals.

Am I missing something? Why don't more people do this? I totally realize there are so many different ways to Day Trade and especially since I am a total noob....but these last few months have been so wonderful and exciting. I keep forgetting we're in the middle of a pandemic. This method of trading also seems less affected by extremely bearish days.

I am based in Japan and stay awake until around 1am which is about 12 noon EST. And then when I wake up I begin to locate my pre-market trades which usually takes me about 2-3 hrs.",,,,,,1591996441.0,,,,,,

TLDR at the bottom, and read the original question before reading this for some context. The basic question here is ""bruh, WTF does this SEC filing even mean?"" and I thought it would be beneficial to see how they all connect, so here ya go:

Let's start with the filing in question, the one in the OP. Notice it says: 

&gt; AMENDMENT NO. 1 DATED JUNE 12, 2020

&gt; To Prospectus Supplement dated June 4, 2020

&gt; (To Prospectus dated June 2, 2020)

So, we should start w/ the June 2 prospectus to really understand what's going on. That filing is a 424B3, a prospectus statement to a previous securities registration agreement (i.e. a plan to sell a bunch of shares in a secondary offering, like a second IPO to raise more money): https://www.bamsec.com/filing/149523120000072?cik=1495231

That filing in itself, if you start reading it, is actually a followup to an even earlier filing, the S3, which is where all this begins: https://www.bamsec.com/filing/149523120000063?cik=1495231

The S-3 is the preliminary registration agreement, basically a ""fill in the blank"" version letting the SEC and the market know that they plan to register some securities to be sold, and they will give you any missing details in a future prospectus, hence the quote right at the top of it: 

&gt; The information in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is **effective**. This prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting offers to buy these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted.

&gt; PROSPECTUS                                Subject to completion, dated May 22, 2020

So ok, let's start with the S3:

Basically, they want to sell a maximum of $75 million in shares ""from time to time"" which is known as a **shelf registration**. In simple terms, they are ""pre-registering"" these shares (putting them on the shelf) to allow them to quickly register and sell them later on:

&gt; This prospectus relates to common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of IZEA Worldwide, Inc. **that we may sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis** directly by us, through agents, dealers or underwriters as designated from time to time, or through a combination of these methods up to a total dollar amount of $75,000,000 on terms to be determined at the time of sale. 

In this document is a bunch of information such as info about the types of securities they may offer (stocks, warrants, bonds, whatever), their plan of distribution (how they will be sold) and so on. You can read through the S3 to get a big picture view of the plan. 

Now diving into the [424B3 filed on 6/2/2020](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/149523120000072?cik=1495231), this is the actual prospectus to the S3, which contains all the missing details that weren't in the that filing. In this case, most of the info was in the shelf registration, so the 424B3 pretty much just specifies the date and is a technicality that must be filed. It does contain one crucial piece of info though:

&gt; By means of this prospectus, we are offering $75,000,000 of our common stock pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. **As of May 14, 2020, the aggregate market value of our outstanding shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or the public float, was $22,985,171**, which was calculated based on 32,630,851 shares of outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates and on a price per share of $0.70, the closing price of our common stock on May 14, 2020. **Pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, in no event will we sell our common stock in a public primary offering with a value exceeding more than one-third of our public float in any 12-month period so long as our public float remains below $75,000,000.** We have not offered any securities pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 during the 12-calendar months prior to and including the date of this prospectus.

Um. wat. Ok it's a lot easier than it sounds. Basically what this means is that until the value of their public float rises above $75,000,000 (float is kinda like their market cap, but it excludes insider holdings, locked up shares and stuff like that - it's a better measure of shares that can be traded by the average joe investor), they are not allowed to sell more than 1/3 the float (i.e. more than $22,985,171 / 3) in any 12 month period. If their float goes above $75M, then they can sell more. That's a standard regulation that is applied to all small companies, so that they don't just dump a huge offering on the market and dilute existing shareholders too much.

There's also one other filing that comes into play at this point: [the EFFECT](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/999999999520001316?cik=1495231) This filing is filed after the SEC gets everything organized and checks all the paperwork, and basically makes the S3 and the 424B3 legally effective, so now they can sell some of the registered shares on the shelf. 

Ok, we're almost to the filing in question...stick with me here, I promise it'll be worth it. Now let's look at the [424B5 filed on 6/4](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/149523120000075?cik=1495231) as a supplement to the 424B3 just discussed. This filing is slightly different in that it is an *actual* offering. Specifically, it's an offering for up to $10 million in shares of the $75 million that they previously registered with form S3, described in detail on form 424B3, and then effected with the EFFECT. You'll see that same key piece of info from above in this filing as well, updated to change a couple dates and stuff, and with one key extra sentence:

&gt; As of May 31, 2020, the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, was **$22,985,171**, based on 32,630,851 shares of outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates, at a price of $0.7044 per share, which was the last reported sale price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on May 14, 2020. Pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, in no event will we sell securities registered on the registration statement of which this prospectus supplement is a part in a primary offering with a value exceeding more than one-third of our public float in any 12-month period so long as our public float remains below $75.0 million. During the 12 calendar-month period that ends on, and includes, the date of this prospectus supplement, **we have not sold any amounts pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3. As a result, we are eligible to offer and sell up to an aggregate of $7,661,724 of shares of our common stock pursuant to such instruction.**

Easy right? Just some simple math: $22,985,171 / 3 = $7,661,724 ... one third their public float. 

Finally we get to the filing in question, the supplement to the supplement to the prospectus to the S3 which was effected by the EFFECT (lol): This is [another 424B5](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/149523120000078?cik=1495231).

This one is similar to the last 424B5, but this time it's an offering for up to $40 million in shares. ""But /u/ghostofgbt, what about the public float thing? I thought no more than one third their public float could be sold?! WTF mate?"" Ok, it's simple: 

&gt; In accordance with the terms of the ATM sales agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $40,000,000 (which amount includes shares we have already sold pursuant to the sales agreement prior to the date of this amendment) from time to time through the sales agent. **As of June 11, 2020, we have sold an aggregate of 4,451,901 shares of our common stock pursuant to the sales agreement for gross proceeds of $10,000,000.**

So they have completed the offering from June 4th (I believe the reason they were able to go above the original $7.66 million in that and go up to $10M is that selling shares actually increases the public float, so there's a bit of a ""we can now sell more cause the float is higher cause we sold more shares"" thing going on there, but someone can correct me if I'm wrong ... I'm not a securities lawyer). Anyway - now we get to the real reason for this supplement: they're allowed to sell more shares from the shelf now! 

&gt; As of the date of the prospectus supplement on June 4, 2020, **we were subject to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 as a result of our public float being less than $75.0 million, which limited the amount of securities we could sell** under the registration statement of which the prospectus supplement forms a part during any 12-month period. **The aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates has subsequently increased above $75.0 million**. As of June 11, 2020, the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, was **$104,573,361**, based on 37,082,752 shares of outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of June 11, 2020 and the last reported sale price of our common stock on June 11, 2020 of $2.82.

So, after a very long journey, we arrive at the TLDR:

**IZEA filed a $75 million shelf registration statement back in May, then filed the prospectus for it on June 2. Subsequently it was EFFECTed on June 3, and on June 4 they actually used it. At the time they were only able to sell $7.66M of stock due to their public float being below $75M. Since completing that offering though, the public float has increased to $104M, (through a combination of selling shares in the previous offering and also a ridiculous upward move in the stock price), putting them above the threshold which was limiting them to only selling 1/3 the float in a 12 month period, so now they're offering to sell up to $40 million of their $75M shelf, which includes the $10 million they've already sold (so, $30M more).**

I don't know why I wrote all that, but I hope it helps.

However, I was blocked from placing anymore long positions on the companies I had already bought in to at the time. I didn't mind though as I was happy with how my positions were doing and my expected profit once they reached high enough for me to close them.

However, I then closed my positions as the prices dropped but I'm still rather restricted, only able to use about half of my capital to invest in the companies that I had previously invested in to and want to continue investing in.

This has never happened to me before and nor am I restricted on other companies it seems (unless I want to use about ¬£10k of capital that I don't have nor would I use like that).

I sent them an email and they said it was decided by their 'Risk Management Team' to ensure a 'safe, fair and equal trading environment'. However, I've heard, apparently, how some companies like this make their money and I fear that they're scared of losing money in some way.

Seems very unethical at the least, in my eyes, despite their claimed intention of making an equal and safe environment. Betting companies don't do this and this is an investment broker! I want to take the risks so I can reap the rewards! Plus, I'm sure a plethora of people have made far more than me on their platform.. just feels like I'm being penalised here.

So, to conclude, has this happened to any one else? Has any one heard of it happening with other brokers? Is it completely normal and I'm just over reacting (but to be honest, I really don't want to miss this incredible opportunity)? Is it something I could raise up with the FCA?

I told him that if the price of the stock reaches the price that it was when he accidentally sold, he can take all of the money that he got from that sale and simply buy the same number of shares again, and everything will be the same (though obviously it would be better to get them at a lower price).

However, he is particularly bent on what his average cost per share is displayed as in his brokerage app. But if he were to use all of the money he got from that sale and simply buy the same number of shares back at the same price, mathematically, everything would be the same, no? Seems logical to me, I just can't figure out how to articulate why the average cost, as displayed in his brokerage app, doesn't actually matter even after it goes up.

I am not a financial or investing expert, but the way I see the market going up or down, I have a feeling that people have short memory and adjust to the ""new reality"" too quickly. Let me explain what I mean.

If a stock was priced at $10 two weeks ago, and then 2 weeks later it is priced at $100 because the company achieved something revolutionary that makes it more competitive, or unique on the market in the face of its competitors - then yes, a subsequent drop of 6% could be considered as a discount and a bargain that can be taken profit of. The way I see this stock, its price has raised because the company has increased its intrinsic value.

Now, if another company's stock was $10 two weeks ago, and then 2 weeks later it is priced at $100 because it was simply caught in a wave of excitement and people blindly bought it for no underlying reason - then in this case, I personally don't consider a subsequent drop of 6% a discount. The stock is still overvalued, for its increase from $10 to $100 is not justified by a fundamental metric. (spare me the talk about how currently fundamentals don't work).

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give you another two analogies, maybe this will strike home better to some people.

&amp;#x200B;

Analogy 1: You favorite chocolate, which cost $1 two weeks ago, suddenly became priced at $10. It is the same chocolate, nothing changed about it's ingredients, weight... ok, maybe its packaging became fancier, but that's all. Now, one day you see the price is now $5. Will you consider this a bargain, 50% discount holly s\*\*t, and buy the product, or maybe buy it in bulk to stock up in case the price goes up again? Or, are you simply going to realize that the price increase from $1 to $10 was unjustified to begin with, and even at $5 it still remains unjustified? Maybe you buy a different chocolate from a different brand? Or maybe you don't buy the chocolate altogether, and save your money to boycott them (the chocolate company)?

Analogy 2 (*this might be a bit extra, but I think it does convey the idea that I mean in an unorthodox way, pun not intended*): So your spouse, who has been good to you, suddenly starts being aggressive and beats the crap out of you. You don't understand why, and you don't question it. Then one day, the spouse stops beating you, but they continue to be aggressive by verbally attacking you. Now, do you think that this is still better than being physically abused, so you settle for this? Or, do you call this BS and get a divorce because you know you deserve better?

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I am not against the market going up, if the growth is justified. Personally, I think it's been a while since we have seen justified growth through technical innovation and progress, instead of artificial growth due to stock buyback and the FED injecting money in the system. But regardless of that, I wonder if there is anything to what I just wrote and whether that makes sense to anyone. Thanks for reading

I've very bullish on a stock that I've been doing my DD on for the past month of so.  I've identified a Cup and Handle, which is a great sign for the long-term.  It's also a U shaped and not a V, which is also positive, however it still is a volatile stock and I have reason to believe that this will drop below the cup's bottom within the next week or two. This leaves me with wondering the following...

If the handle goes below the bottom of the cup in a short period of time is it considered a C&amp;H?

If so, how low should the handle be in comparison to the cup to be considered a true C&amp;H?

I understand that there are other indicators to look out for in bullish stocks, but I'm still learning.

I thought I had seen everything in this market but this just shows you that nothing is off the table. Before you buy HTZ, please realize that if you participate in this offering (if it even ends up being allowed, which is questionable), all you're doing is paying off HTZ debt and throwing money at Jeffries for underwriting it.

On the flip side, given the current market conditions, it's not the worst idea and while IMO it's disgustingly predatory I can't say I blame HTZ for trying to take advantage of this market nonsense. If they do manage to convince a court to allow this, it actually does give equity holders a chance to get something which they certainly won't get if it just goes the pure bankruptcy route. I suppose if you just have blind faith that HTZ can come out of bankruptcy and be a better company then it makes sense to gamble on it, as long as you realize you're buying something for $4 a share that is literally worth zero. This is truly the greater fool theory in action. What a time to be alive lol

An explaination of CACC\'s accounting methods courtesy of [Matthew Greenberg - @greenycapital over on Twitter](https://twitter.com/greenycapital/status/1271197048574967808):\n\n""Over the next few weeks I‚Äôll be rolling out some threads on CACC as we approach the end of what could be a company altering quarter. This is the first of those threads, and it is going to be about ‚Äúlevel-yield‚Äù and ‚Äúeffective yield‚Äù interest method accounting. Historically ‚Äúlevel-yield‚Äù and ‚Äúeffective yield‚Äù amortization have been used primarily as ways of, in the most accurate way possible, reflecting interest earned on a bond purchased or sold at a discount to fair value. The system works like this:\n\nA purchaser (or seller) of a discount bond records a loans receivable (loan payable) amount on the balance sheet equal to the $ paid (received) for that bond. Over time, that bonds value is increased such that at maturity, the bond‚Äôs book value equals its par value. This can be done through straight line amortization, but doing so does not take into account the compounding interest rate an investor earns/company pays by buying/selling that bond. Level-yield and effective yield accounting do by calculating a YTM for the bond and amortizing. By applying that YTM to the book value of the bond to calculate interest income/expense. As the BV  grows towards par value, the interest income/expense grows proportionally, thus more accurately representing the true yield the investor/seller receives/pays over the bonds life.\n\nCACC uses level/effective-yield in a different way. Pre-CECL, when CACC purchased a loan from a dealer they record a receivables balance equal to the advance paid for the loan and an ‚Äúaccretable yield‚Äù balance equal to the company‚Äôs expected collections net of the advance. The amortization of that ‚Äúaccretable yield‚Äù was done by applying the level-yield to the loan‚Äôs carrying value the same way it‚Äôs done in a typical bond amortization. The problem? This practice does not accurately reflect the reality of CACC‚Äôs business the way it does for others.\n\nCACC purchases a loan for their purchase program with $200 of contractual payments owed over 5 years for $100. They expect to collect $150 of that amount. They record a loan receivable balance of $100, and an accretable yield balance of $50 to be amortized over those 5 years. They assume $30 of payments in each year and calculate a ‚Äúlevel-yield‚Äù of 15.2% to maturity. In the first period, CACC will record accretion of $15.22 no matter how much they actually collect from the borrower. They then net out the remainder of the collections as principal. If there‚Äôs a collection shortfall, CACC takes a provision equal to that amount (even if expected collections over the loan‚Äôs life don‚Äôt change), and adjusts the accretable yield to equal (AY at start of period 1 - accretion + provisions + net change in forecast). At that point, CACC recalculates their expected collections and adjusts the yield. If collections were in-line, and expectations are stable the rate will be the same. If forecasts were raised, they will raise the level-yield to account for this; if not THEY DONT CHANGE THE YIELD That‚Äôs right, CACC uses the higher of the initial YTM and the calculated level yield. So let‚Äôs just assume collections go exactly as expected. What happens? CACC recognizes accretion of $15.22 in Y1, $12.97 in Y2, $10.93 in Y3, $7.47 in Y4 and $3.41 in Y5. Meanwhile, they recognize principal of $14.78, $17.03, $19.07, $22.53, $26.59 respectively in each of those years. See the problem yet? CACC is collecting $30 in each period, but recognizing $.51/$1 of collections in year 1, and $.11/$1 in year 5. Meanwhile, their credit risk grows (cars depreciate in value, so the underlying value of the collateral is declining even as contractual payments stay stable). So, CACC recognizes 56% of a loan‚Äôs accretable yield in years 1 and 2, but only 31% of the principal. It‚Äôs a mismatch. That‚Äôs fine if it was the other way around, but as is, CACC is recognizing revenue it has not earned yet. If collections come in lower than expected after those two years, they have to take a larger write-down on receivables because they overstated loan income in the first 2 yrs\n\nSo that brings us to today, where COVID is ravaging CACC‚Äôs loan book. They are seeing collections come in below expectations, when they‚Äôve already taken more in loan income  than they will earn over the life of the loan. This leads to massive provisions for losses. Meanwhile, the loans that are performing as expected are effectively non-performing loans, with receivables on the BS earning substantially less in accretable yield/dollar collected. Add on top of that the impact of CECL, which makes new originations a NI negative in year one. And CACC is essentially in earnings hell. Usually, they grow their loan book to offset the fact that all loan vintages are now earning less/$ collected than they did the year before as a result of level-yield, but with CECL that growth will be NI negative. The company is going to do their best to keep non-CECL provisions as low as possible, but given the amount of accretion they‚Äôve pulled forward, it‚Äôs going to be very hard to do that. How are lenders going to feel with revenue collapsing and provisions growing? Not good. Especially the lenders and senior secured bond holders, who are junior to the ABS holders in a liquidation event. The company had $25 mil of non-restricted cash on the BS at the end of Q1. I would not want to be a creditor watching earnings collapse even as collections stabilize.\n\nThat‚Äôs it for this thread, will be back with more periodically as I see fit over the next few weeks. Feel free to reach out with questions, I know it‚Äôs complicated and Twitter isn‚Äôt the best platform for this, but it‚Äôs the best option I‚Äôve got.""\n\nTL:DR - Short / Put CACC to oblivion.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;CACC is a predatory auto loans company. &lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/06/03/867856602/millions-of-americans-skipping-payments-as-tidal-wave-of-defaults-and-evictions-?utm_source=pocket-newtab""&gt;Due to Coronavirus people have been defaulting on their loans&lt;/a&gt;.

This practice does not accurately reflect the reality of CACC‚Äôs business the way it does for others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CACC purchases a loan for their purchase program with $200 of contractual payments owed over 5 years for $100. They expect to collect $150 of that amount. They record a loan receivable balance of $100, and an accretable yield balance of $50 to be amortized over those 5 years. They assume $30 of payments in each year and calculate a ‚Äúlevel-yield‚Äù of 15.2% to maturity. In the first period, CACC will record accretion of $15.22 no matter how much they actually collect from the borrower. They then net out the remainder of the collections as principal. If there‚Äôs a collection shortfall, CACC takes a provision equal to that amount (even if expected collections over the loan‚Äôs life don‚Äôt change), and adjusts the accretable yield to equal (AY at start of period 1 - accretion + provisions + net change in forecast). At that point, CACC recalculates their expected collections and adjusts the yield. If collections were in-line, and expectations are stable the rate will be the same. If forecasts were raised, they will raise the level-yield to account for this; if not THEY DONT CHANGE THE YIELD That‚Äôs right, CACC uses the higher of the initial YTM and the calculated level yield. So let‚Äôs just assume collections go exactly as expected. What happens? CACC recognizes accretion of $15.22 in Y1, $12.97 in Y2, $10.93 in Y3, $7.47 in Y4 and $3.41 in Y5. Meanwhile, they recognize principal of $14.78, $17.03, $19.07, $22.53, $26.59 respectively in each of those years. See the problem yet? CACC is collecting $30 in each period, but recognizing $.51/$1 of collections in year 1, and $.11/$1 in year 5. Meanwhile, their credit risk grows (cars depreciate in value, so the underlying value of the collateral is declining even as contractual payments stay stable). So, CACC recognizes 56% of a loan‚Äôs accretable yield in years 1 and 2, but only 31% of the principal. It‚Äôs a mismatch. That‚Äôs fine if it was the other way around, but as is, CACC is recognizing revenue it has not earned yet. If collections come in lower than expected after those two years, they have to take a larger write-down on receivables because they overstated loan income in the first 2 yrs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that brings us to today, where COVID is ravaging CACC‚Äôs loan book. They are seeing collections come in below expectations, when they‚Äôve already taken more in loan income  than they will earn over the life of the loan. This leads to massive provisions for losses. Meanwhile, the loans that are performing as expected are effectively non-performing loans, with receivables on the BS earning substantially less in accretable yield/dollar collected. Add on top of that the impact of CECL, which makes new originations a NI negative in year one. And CACC is essentially in earnings hell. Usually, they grow their loan book to offset the fact that all loan vintages are now earning less/$ collected than they did the year before as a result of level-yield, but with CECL that growth will be NI negative. The company is going to do their best to keep non-CECL provisions as low as possible, but given the amount of accretion they‚Äôve pulled forward, it‚Äôs going to be very hard to do that. How are lenders going to feel with revenue collapsing and provisions growing? Not good. Especially the lenders and senior secured bond holders, who are junior to the ABS holders in a liquidation event. The company had $25 mil of non-restricted cash on the BS at the end of Q1. I would not want to be a creditor watching earnings collapse even as collections stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs it for this thread, will be back with more periodically as I see fit over the next few weeks. Feel free to reach out with questions, I know it‚Äôs complicated and Twitter isn‚Äôt the best platform for this, but it‚Äôs the best option I‚Äôve got.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR - Short / Put CACC to oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'wallstreetbets', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2th52', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/wallstreetbets', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1270550, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'DD on the fall of Credit Acceptance Corp.', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 21, 'upvote_ratio': 0.84, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7kdr3/dd_on_the_fall_of_credit_acceptance_corp/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'wls': 0}]",,,,,,,,

Markets had an epic crash all day yesterday. This is the expected result after weeks of buying without any pullbacks. The new retail traders all felt like geniuses while the market was soaring. Yesterday brought them back to reality.

Futures are up this morning bouncing well off the lows. But the **VIX** is way up too.

I expect to see some risky stocks coming into play today as the new day traders try to get back to even after yesterday's losses.

**Watchlist:**

**FFHL** is a low float, super speculative, lets see if it can get back up to $5

**CTIB** is another super speculative low float, already made a huge move this morning. On watch.

**LLIT** is a low float, watching for a breakout above yesterday's highs $0.85

**JP** is a low float, resistance at $2.60

**CLDX** was the big winner yesterday, I'm watching for a setup above $9

**IZEA** watching for a setup above $3

**EMAN** is a contract winner, I'll take a setup above VWAP",,,,,,,,,,,,

My  understanding is back in March 2020, when the market crashed thanks to  Covid-19, the Feds decided to conduct repos where they will be buying  bonds/securities from the open market so the open market can have more  liquidity (aka cash). I spent hours searching and trying to understand  the relationship between the Feds and the Treasury and where they get  their money from but it seemed like the more I read, the more confusing I  got.

Can someone pls explain or dumb it down for me about how this whole situation works.

So  did Treasury (Mnuchin) asked Congress to approve trillions of dollars  of securities so they can sell it to citizens, banks, etc. to have cash?  and then the Feds went to buy back those securities to pump back cash into the market? Isn't this just like selling and borrowing against themselves?

If I understand correctly,CLO's are almost identical to CDO's, except they're portfolios of business loans instead of home loans. Since CLO's are only as good as their AAA rating, which comes from the 'low' probability of a bunch of risky loans defaulting at once, could the next nation-wide shutdown lead to high enough default rates of businesses that they cause the CLO market to implode? There is so much capital in CLO's right now...

I feel like I'm missing something, like maybe there's a failsafe or contingency for CLO's I don't know of, or maybe they aren't as big of a deal as it seems in my limited knowledge... Could anyone else expand on this?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Don't worry boys there's still a way you can make money off this. VIX aka Volatility Index. VIX gauges market volatility and increases in value as market conditions become less predictable. VIX shot up during the March crash due to the coronavirus and came back down to earth a month and change later. VIX is once again shooting back up because of adverse market conditions. We know market volatility cannot stay this high forever. So what's the plan? Puts on VIX. If you want to play it safe like I did time it for July.

After listening to much exuberance around here, it's refreshing to see the market doing something rational, even if abrupt, for once. I think that bulls are both trolling too much and showing too much confidence.

So, I'd like to provide my point of view, and have a discussion about, the current state of things. I honestly don't want to predict anything, although I'm currently bearish about the whole situation. These are the following things I see as relevant for today's drop:

1. **Sentiment.** I noticed in the past few days an increase of posts and news about cashing in on the market, and how to sell and what to do in case of a downturn.
2. **Breaking barriers.** I think it's significant that, on the same day, the S&amp;P 500 nudged positive for the year *and* the NASDAQ reached an all-time high. These may serve as psychological barriers that make people thing whether the rally may have gone too far, or if it's time to cash in.
3. **Fundamentals.** It's undeniable that the market is currently detached from fundamentals
4. **FED.** Their bearish take on things likely served as a catalyser, but that's it.

I'd like to also point out that **European equities were already falling 3% when the US markets opened**, so there was definitely something going.

As for my take in the future, I honestly have no idea. The fact that this has been a top story in non-financial outlets may help bolster the selloff, but I wouldn't take it for granted just yet. Specially because there have been no additional news (e.g. coronavirus, significant bankruptcies) that can fuel it.

In any case, the simple fact that such an abrupt slump happened in the first place shows how dangerous this market is.

What's your take on this?",,,,,,1591920504.0,,,,,,

Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.
