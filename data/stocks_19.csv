If the community finds this useful, I'd be happy to continue posting (perhaps daily?).

&amp;#x200B;

Explanation: my approach is based on simple moving averages (SMA). Typical analysts use either the 50-day or 200-day SMA, but there is value in averaging over other periods as well. My approach is to run a loop from 200 to 5 days, and for each period compute the SMA, it's derivative, and second derivative. I then plug in today's date, and average the current SMA and its derivatives (with equal weights, although this could be changed in the future). The average derivative is essentially the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), and the average 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2). 

&amp;#x200B;

For buying/selling stocks, I look mainly at the velocity (avg d in the following table) to define my strategy, and remove those with negative acceleration. For options, I tend to look further into the future and utilize the acceleration over the velocity to get an idea of where the stock will be headed.

&amp;#x200B;

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations on financials, etc. It is simply based on the history of each ticker. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite ticker added, just let me know.  


Cheers!  


Disclosure: I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list. Yesterday I bought HEXO, PLUG, LTC, ENPH, and SNAP. I'm holding CRON and not adding to my position due to the negative acceleration, but may change that opinion in the future.

Four intrepid economists—Wei Chen, Xilu Chen and Michael Song of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, along with Chang-Tai Hsieh of the University of Chicago—have taken a fine-toothed comb to Chinese economic data to try to tease out China's true rate of economic growth since 2008. Not surprisingly, they found that China has been over-reporting its growth rate by an average of 1.7 percentage points every year.

&gt; Shave off a little growth every year for the last dozen years ago, and the cumulative effect is that China is now overstating its true GDP by nearly 20 percent.

I plan on investing my own money from my job, how much control over the account do I have? Is it just that if I want to do anything it needs to be approved or are all transactions made on my parents account?

What are some good options? I want one with no or a very low minimum balance as I will only be investing my own money and with low or no commissions as I don’t want to be paying a lot for small investments.

In my state the age of trust termination is 21, if I go to college in a state where it is lower which age do I get control? 

Any input is appreciated, 
Thanks!

1.You have established the following position: Short 1 ABCD 320 put @ 6 If the delta of the put is 0.50 and the gamma is 0.03, what would the new delta be if ABCD decreases from 321 to 320? 0.47, 0.50, 0.53, 0.56, 0.60 

2. Which of the following is a primary component in theoretical options pricing calculations? Volatility, stock price, days to expiration, strike price, all the above 

3. To hedge a short stock position in ABCD, you can do all the following except what? Buy at money ABCD calls to open, Buy in the money ABCD calls to open, Sell out of the money ABCD puts to open, sell out of the money ABCD calls to open 

4. The price of ABCD is $25. You establish the following position: Short 1 ABCD 25 Call @ 2 If the delta of the call is 0.50, what would be the theoretical price of the option if ABCD increased by $1.00? $1.50, $2.50, $3.00, $4.00, $4.50 

5. With everything being equal as time passes in options, which one of the following is true? Delta for in the money options decreases and the delta for out of the money options increases; delta for in the money options increases, and the delta for out of the money options increases; delta decreases for both in money options and out of money options; delta for in money options increases, and delta for out of money options decreases 

6. In portfolio margin, equity options and stocks are tested with +/- 15% price changes. If you buy $100,000 worth of ABCD stock, what is the portfolio margin requirement? $15000, $25000, $50000, $30000

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

&gt; **Boeing** — Boeing remains on watch, as noted above, after falling more than 11 percent over the past two sessions. Some U.S. lawmakers are calling for the Federal Aviation Administration to ground the 737 Max jets after their involvement in two overseas air crashes, but the agency maintains that the jet is airworthy.

Disclaimer I am long VICL. 


VICL is a shell company. This means it is non active and currently a vehicle for possible financial maneuvers. What’s of interest is the balance sheet as VICL liquidation value is significantly above the price it currently trades. Looking at the balance sheet we need to discount assets that will be difficult to convert to cash. Figures in millions*

Cash $11,870 - no discount needed. 
Marketable Sec. $36,201 no discount needed. 
Receivables and other assets $1,128 - 70% discounted value = $790. 
Long term investments (bonds) $2,386 - 90% discounted value = $2,147. 
Equipment + other assets $759 - 30 % discounted value = $227. 
Total liquidation value of assets - $51,235. 
Liabilities don’t not get discounted they are almost always the same as listed on balance sheet. 
Liabilities on balance sheet - $3,581. 
Total liquidation value $47,654. 
Total shares outstanding 21,820,195. 
Per share =$2.18. 

Now since company is now a shell cash burn should drop significantly as company isn’t doing much. Cash burn may be slightly over $1 million /year. Very manageable and wont destroy thesis, if company takes time exploring options. We can see a reverse merger similar to GTXI (check chart). Or company liquidates. Worst case company buys new drug candidate, possibly overpays for another business. Overall low risk trade with sizable reward:risk profile. Time line for trade is under a year. Reverse merger could be announced at any time, thinking news within 3 months.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

&amp;#x200B;

Fintech is arguably one of the hottest spaces right now. Here are a couple articles covering how much money has been poured into companies in the space domestically and internationally - it's honestly mind-boggling.

[Fintech companies raised a record $39.6 billion in 2018: research](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fintech-funding/fintech-companies-raised-a-record-39-6-billion-in-2018-research-idUSKCN1PN0EL) \-- ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Venture capital-backed financial technology companies raised a record $39.57 billion from investors globally in 2018, up 120 percent from the previous year, according to research by data provider CB Insights published on Tuesday.""

&amp;#x200B;

My 6 hottest picks in the fintech/payments/e-commerce space:

* Square ([$SQ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=sq))
   * Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California.
   * Square's growth is just beginning. Square has tapped into multiple different verticals of financial services beyond POS (Point of Sale). They are no longer branded as just a ""credit card reader"" company; they've become a financial ecosystem for small businesses.
   * Read through the [Shareholder Letter](https://s21.q4cdn.com/114365585/files/doc_financials/2018/Q4/2018-Q4-Shareholder-Letter-Square.pdf) for visuals on their massive growth and new acquisition channels. 
* Paypal ([$PYPL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pypl))
   * PayPal was the OG pioneer in the fintech/payments space.
   * PayPal Holdings, Inc. is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders.
   * [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/salesforce-and-paypal-among-tech-stocks-set-to-gain-this-year-14884036](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/salesforce-and-paypal-among-tech-stocks-set-to-gain-this-year-14884036) \--""The company showed its best quarter ever for new accounts, with 13.8 million net new users powering a 31% gain in the full-year number of 38.7 million. Total payment volume processed was $578 billion, a gain of 27% from the previous year. The Venmo segment showed an 80% year-over-year increase in payment volume.""
   * [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/paypal-long-term-plan-ebay-14871120](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/paypal-long-term-plan-ebay-14871120)
* PagSeguro Digital ([$PAGS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pags))
   * PagSeguro is a Brazilian FinTech that is best of its class and has already developed an extensive digital eco-system that is comparable to what Square has developed in the US.
   * PagSeguro is an online or mobile payment-based e-commerce service for commercial operations. PagSeguro is part of Universo Online which, according to Ibope Nielsen Online, is the Brazil's largest internet portal with more than 50 million unique visitors and 6.7 billion page views every month.
   * Brazil is well positioned to benefit from secular growth trends where digital payments, banking and credit card usage for individuals and businesses is under-penetrated compared to the developed world.
   * The future is bright for PagSeguro which should continue to enjoy high revenue growth, Total Payments Volume (TPV) growth and active client growth.
* StoneCo Ltd ([$STNE](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=stne))
   * It turned profitable in the first half of 2018 and is estimated to grow earnings 150% in 2019, to 80 cents per share (!!!)
   * ""Brazilian PayPal"" -- This one is HOT with massive institutional support.
   * Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway currently holding the second largest stake in the recent IPO stock with 11.8% of its shares.
   * Another good sign is the fact the biggest holder of all is T. Rowe Price Associates, with a huge 24.1% stake. Several Fidelity funds are StoneCo holders as well.

* Mercadolibre Inc ([$MELI](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=meli))

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

So I just came across this extremely vague email (that I was not supposed to find) from 2013 from my mother where it was basically her apparently selling my stock shares (again sorry for the incorrect usage of words) that she had held since during that time I was under 18. The thing here is I didn’t even know at the time I held shares in Dominion’s stock but I do know she had no right to go behind my back and sell it, well I think. 

So basically I have no idea what was invested at the time nor how long the shares were in there. But I was 14 in 2013 and let’s say for ever since I was born I had had a share in the whole thing and the original investment was $100 — this is just a complete made up scenario but also a possible one — what would the amount have been that she would have gotten?


This is not the first time she took money from me that was in my name (that’s another story for another time in another subreddit though) so this just makes me incredibly angry and frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

Second week is complete! This week was a little on the slow side. I entered 3 trades this week, currently still holding 2 out of the 3 as they have not hit my price target or my stop loss yet. I feel pretty comfortable with both hitting next week though. This week with holding 2 of my 3 trades I am up **$80.59**. Good to still be up in back to back weeks, was a little afraid of these 2 plays I'm in taking a while to play out but hopefully both will hit and I can reach that $11,000 mark. Let's check out the trades that I made this week.

These were the tickers I traded for the week of March 4th 2019:

* **NGD**
* **BIOC**
* **SRNE**

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the log above, another week where the loss I did take was very small. This is very important as there will always be losses in trading but if you can keep those losses small and take advantage of your wins you can consistently be profitable. Also sticking to your stop losses or technical breaks is key, a lot of traders when it gets to that point decide to hold out for a bounce that never happens.

### Trade Highlights

**SRNE** \- This was the only stock I executed a buy and sell on for the week and was pretty disappointing. Although I didn't have a whole lot of money in this trade, I felt very confident in the chart playing out and this being a successful trade. This was a trade I could have easily fallen too in love with and held for a large loss because I really liked the chart setup. In situations like this it is best to try and approach trading as if you are a robot, no emotions no second guessing none of that. Keep it robotic, set an entry price, set a price target and set a stop loss **AND STICK TO IT**. This trade I entered at $2.02 and wanted to see about $2.15 with a stop loss if $1.95 broke. The next day we got a nice bounce up to $2.13, very close to my exit, hindsight is always nice. Then the stock took a drop late in the day and the next day sold off further. Once $1.95 broke I exited the trade and was ready to move on to the next one. Check out the chart below and you can see once that $1.95 level broke this stock fell all the way down to $1.81. When a strong support level breaks you usually see a big sell off on the technical breakdown. This is another reason why you have to do your best to leave emotions out of your trades, had I decided oh well this stock will probably bounce back, I could have taken a bigger loss rather than sticking to my stop and taking a small loss and moving on to the next trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**NGD** \- This trade is still ongoing, I entered on Monday at $0.85. Feeling very confident in this one, expecting to be able to exit at $0.90+ on Monday or Tuesday of next week. Gold is currently on the rise a bit as market has been sliding. NGD closed Friday just under $0.89 so already up nicely on this trade. I noticed it had a pretty strong support level in the $0.84-$0.85 level so that's where I jumped in at. My price target was $0.90 and my stop loss was $0.83. So as you can see I essentially was risking 2 cents for a potential reward of 5 cents or more. Always analyze you risk vs. reward on each trade, you want the reward to be greater than the risk. Hopefully I will have a positive update on this one in my next week report.

&amp;#x200B;

**BIOC** \- This is the other trade that I am still holding, I also entered this one on Monday at $1.03. I would gauge my level of concern on this trade as mild. I have a stop loss on this stock at $0.97, I felt like the bottom had been re-established at $1.02, that broke at one point this week, I also felt $1.00 was a strong level for this stock too, that level broke temporarily as well this week. Both of those things have me slightly concerned but after both of those breaks the stock bounced right back which is encouraging. My main concern with this trade is the length of time I am holding it, This stock has traded very sideways for several months, but it has had a few nice pops over $1.10. I will be keeping a close eye on this one throughout the week and hopefully get to exit for profit in the $1.08-$1.10 range.

# Key Takeaways

Pretty slow uneventful week, pumped for NGD next week! One thing I keep working on is screening for good setups and maintaining a good risk vs. reward ratio. I really like to trade support/resistance levels as it gives me a clear exit for a stop loss and can give some good price targets based on resistance points. The downside to this is these plays usually are fairly slow and take some time to play out. As you can see with BIOC and NGD. Both were support plays and although NGD is near my price target, it has been a slow mover along with BIOC all week. I may go back and look at a few of my other momentum based strategies that tend to be slightly riskier but can produce quicker gains. I think a nice mix of the two could provide some solid results. I will keep my goal for next week at $11,000. If NGD and BIOC both hit their respective price targets that will put my account over $11,000 and then from there the next goal will be the road to $15,000 over the next couple months.

Hope you enjoyed reading about my journey for this week. Hope you keep following and commenting for future weeks. Looking forward to what everyone has to say this week!

I'm trying to see if they're going to go anywhere. A friend and I are debating throwing \~60 bucks into 100 shares right now, but I'm not seeing any indication of growth from any recent press releases or their past volumes. My friend claims we could double profits, but I'm not sure.

# **Week Ahead: After mysterious lack of new jobs, slew of US data will be a big deal  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/08/week-ahead-after-mysterious-lack-of-new-jobs-slew-of-us-data-will-be-a-big-deal.html)**
*****
&gt; Economic data could trump all else in the week ahead, after hiring in February appeared to fall off a cliff, raising new concerns about the economy.
*****
&gt; January's delayed retail sales report, durable goods and February's CPI inflation data all take on added significance, particularly since there has been a mixed stream of economic data lately.
*****
&gt; The report Friday of just 20,000 nonfarm payrolls created in February was shockingly weak, compared to the expected 180,000 jobs. The data reflected slower growth, but also possible ill effects of bad weather, the government shutdown and other statistical abnormalities.
*****
&gt; But economists, while doubting the report, also said they are paying close attention to incoming data for signs the report is either an outlier or the beginning of a broader more negative trend.
*****
&gt; ""You go from 310,000 jobs to 20,000. That doesn't seem logical,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. "" I think we look back over the past few months and we had that very disappointing December retail sales number. That seemed a bit of a fluke...But we're quants. You can't just toss out the data that doesn't agree with your existing view.""
*****
&gt; The other significant market factor in the week ahead could be any developments on U.S.-China trade negotiations.
*****
&gt; But the overriding issue is whether the global economy is slowing, particularly as China's data continues to look weak.
*****
&gt; Not all was negative in the U.S. February employment report. Economists said wage growth of 3.4 percent year over year and a lower 3.8 percent unemployment rate were encouraging, as were other data. The report also followed an unusually strong January number of 311,000, after revisions.
*****
&gt; The 35-day government shutdown delayed many reports and may have affected the quality of others, economists said. The weakening trend in the first quarter, while expected, is hard to get a handle on, and while it's expected to be temporary, every negative report increases doubts.
*****
&gt; ""Anybody who is mentioning the word 'recession' is wrong. The economy invariably slows in Q1. What we don't know is it more than usual, and the poor quality and volatility in the data since the government shutdown has made it impossible to assess,"" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies.
*****
&gt; First out of the gate Monday will be retail sales, which fell 1.2 percent in December. January's headline number is expected to fall by 0.1 percent but excluding autos and gasoline, sales are expected to rise by 0.7 percent, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Economists say the big drop in retail sales for December makes the comparisons in the first quarter GDP report more difficult. First quarter growth is widely expected to be below 2 percent but the economy is expected to bounce back above 2 percent growth in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; ""We are already pretty weak [in the first quarter] because of the retail sales number. The arithmetic that goes into adding up GDP, you're in such a hole to start the quarter because you ended so weak,"" said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at NatWest Markets.
*****
&gt; Durable goods for January is reported Wednesday, and economists are watching to see what happened to business spending in that report. At the end of the quarter, expenditures slowed down, yet in the fourth quarter GDP report, business spending was surprisingly strong.
*****
&gt; CPI on Tuesday is also important. With the Fed now signaling it is pausing in its rate hiking, any surprise pickup in inflation would be significant.
*****
&gt; ""Inflation data is important from the Fed's perspective, but I don't think it's going to be something that's going to spook them if we get a stronger report,"" said Cummins. ""We expect 0.3 on headline, core 0.2 percent. Year-over-year core would stay at 2.2 percent for the third month. It doesn't seem like something that's market moving if our forecast is realized.""
*****
&gt; The Fed will largely be out of the picture in the coming week, with Fed officials in a quiet period ahead of the next meeting March 19 and 20. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was to appear in an interview on ""60 Minutes"" Sunday.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq and Dow all down more than 2 percent in their worst week since Dec. 21, right before the Christmas Eve plunge. The market reacted to signs of slowing global growth and concerns the trade talks would not lead to deal.
*****
&gt; Keon said the market could be disappointed by a trade deal, unless it is is broad and includes protection for intellectual property and an end of Chinese transfers of U.S. technology. White House top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Friday that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet later this month but nothing is in ""cement.""
*****
&gt; Speaking on CNBC, he pointed to overnight economic data from China that showed exports there plunged 20.7 percent last month from a year ago, missing expectations by a wide margin.
*****
&gt; ""We have hurt them,"" Kudlow said on ""Squawk on the Street."" Both sides have indicated they hope to reach a deal. ""We are still negotiating by phone and teleconference.""
*****
&gt; Keon said a sweeping deal, with an end to tariffs and a hardline on technology, would drive the market higher.
*****
&gt; ""If you get a real deal, you would get a big response. I would not really count on that as a big positive catalyst for stock prices, but it's possible. If the whole thing falls apart, in that case it would be pretty negative for the market, particularly if we increased tariffs,"" said Keon.
*****
&gt; Trump has held off another round of tariffs, expected March 1, due to progress in the talks.

# The Bespoke Report — The KISS Market

&gt; Global equity markets had a rough week, but the US staged a nice intraday rally on Friday after an NFP-driven gap lower. Global economic data has been rough, but there are reasons for optimism. In this week’s Bespoke Report, we talk about earnings, smart money flows, retail flows, economic data, and upticks in US data we’ve seen since last Friday. For the S&amp;P 500, the technical line in the sand is 2,816, while 10 year yields are desperately clinging to 2.61% support that has held for the past few months.

# Head and Shoulders Above Average Pre-Election Year Gains

&gt; Even after a few tepid trading sessions, DJIA is still up 10.6% year-to-date as of today’s close. S&amp;P 500 is up 11.3% and NASDAQ is at 14.2%. Compared to average pre-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all up above average for this point of the year. Pre-election years have historically produced the best average performance out of the four-year cycle. Other than some mild weakness in May, July and October the trend in past pre-election years has generally been higher and higher.

# The Nasdaq’s 10 Weeks of Green

&gt; U.S. stocks’ recent momentum has been historically impressive by many measures, and the Nasdaq Composite Index notched another milestone last week.

&gt; The Nasdaq has risen for the past 10 weeks, its longest winning streak in 19 years. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the feat could signal more gains for U.S. stocks: In seven of the last eight 10-week winning streaks, both the Nasdaq and the broader market have climbed over the following 12 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/10-Week-NASDAQ-winning-streaks-are-historically-bullish.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Technology stocks have rallied 23% since bottoming on December 24, 2018. While equities began the year extremely oversold, solid corporate earnings, a Federal Reserve pause, and progress on trade have helped fuel risk-on sentiment and boost prices.

&gt; “We expect stocks to power through periodic bouts of uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While the road to new market highs could get bumpy, we encourage investors to focus on the fundamentals supporting economic growth and corporate profitability in 2019.”

&gt; The one outlier in Nasdaq’s history of 10-week streaks is the one ending in December 1999, three months before the peak of the “tech bubble.” From the beginning of 1999 to March 2000, the Nasdaq more than doubled to reach record highs, then fell more than 70% through the end of 2002.

&gt; In contrast to that period, we don’t see material signs of excesses in financial markets, and the recent rally has been more broad-based and backed by strong earnings growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average have both climbed 16% over the past 10 weeks, pacing with the Nasdaq’s 20% gain.

# Slow, But Steady

&gt; Slow but steady growth may win the race again as the economic expansion nears the 10-year mark.

&gt; While muted growth in the current economic expansion has been frustrating at times, especially after a swift and painful downturn amid the 2008 financial crisis, it has helped extend the life of this cycle and keep excesses in check.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has increased an average of 2.3% annually in this cycle, the slowest pace of growth among all expansions since 1970 and a key contributor to this cycle’s near-record age.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Slow-But-Steady-GDP-Growth-Compared-to-Past-Cycles.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Historically, cycles with annual GDP growth higher than 4% lasted about five years on average, while cycles with annual growth lower than 4% lasted about nine years on average.

&gt; “While it’s important to be mindful of where we are in the economic cycle, later-cycle economies can continue to exhibit stable growth for years,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We’re maintaining our positive outlook for 2019, thanks to our conviction in sound fundamentals supporting moderate economic growth.”

&gt; Steady economic growth has been helped in part by a careful and gradual approach to monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policy efforts have been implemented for several years, but policymakers only started increasing rates in December 2015, more than six years into the expansion. This tightening cycle has persisted for three years now, yet inflation-adjusted interest rates are barely above zero.

&gt; Still, inflation has hovered around the Fed’s 2% target for several months now, and wage growth is healthy, but manageable. Leading market and economic indicators (including ones we track in our Recession Watch Dashboard) also hint to more runway in the expansion.

Albeit I fault the decline partly and perhaps unjustly to the general ebbing of the Healthcare Sector, there has been another suspected.
&amp;nbsp;

Tony Owusu, author with Cramer’s The Street, blames Aurora’s ($ACB) 4% drop today on the pending resignation of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) head Scott Gottlieb. To be honest, I don’t know what is more shocking: Gottlieb’s suspiciously abrupt announcement to leave the FDA hours after attacking major corporations for enabling minors to smoke or Cramer’s minion thinking that this resignation would disrupt the Cannabis Sector.
&amp;nbsp;

Gottlieb isn’t exactly a proponent of marijuana. Although the FDA has approved cannabidiol-based medications like GW Pharmaceuticals' ($GWPH) Epidiolex, in a Novemeber 2018 interview on CNBC, Gottlieb repudiates: “We have approved compounds derived from marijuana but there is no demonstrated medical use for botanical marijuana.” Gottlieb, the hundreds of thousands of medical marijuana users would disagree with you.
&amp;nbsp;

In fact, the primary candidate to take Gottlieb’s roll, Amy Abernethy, current principal deputy commissioner the FDA is more than likely a supporter. Abernethy, who was just recently brought on the FDA is a researcher who spent a majority of her academic career at Duke. During her time as Assistant Professor of Medicine and Nursing and Director of the Palliative Care Clinical Research Initiative at the university, Abernethy helped edit a paper by Bill H. McCarberg titled, “Cannabinoids - Their Role in Pain and Palliation.” Understanding that Abernethy, who is also a former Disney Can-Can dancer, has devoted much of her time in modern research and assisted in publishing articles advocating the use of cannabis in pain management, it is plausible that marijuana regulation will likely loosen if she heads the FDA.
&amp;nbsp;

Norman Sharpless (Ned), current director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is another contender for Gottlieb’s position. In the 1980’s Ned coauthored articles that discussed marijuana's euphorigenic properties in rats. Today, the NCI’s website admits, “cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years.. promoted for reported analgesic, sedative, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and anticonvulsant effects.” Their website even states that physicians were the principal opponents of the Marihuana Tax Act 1937 which made cannabis more difficult to procure. As many cancer patients are users of medicinal marijuana and NCI’s website seems to recognize the benefits of both THC and CBD, Ned Sharpless would likely clear the way for healthcare providers to research and develop cannabis medication.
&amp;nbsp;

Next on the list is Brett Giroir, Assistant Secretary for Health in the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, FDA’s parent agency. Giroir has been extremely public about removing CBD from DEA’s Schedule 1 status writing that “CBD and its salts [should] be controlled in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act."" Schedule V drugs demonstrate medical values and are deemed unlikely to cause harm, abuse, or addiction.
&amp;nbsp;

Janet Woodcock is another prospect for the position. Currently heading the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research CDER, Woodcock has rejected proposals by Drug Watch International to place marijuana on another list of restricted substances. She is already part of the team that is working with companies to fast track effective medications including those containing CBD.
&amp;nbsp;

So why, Tony Owusu? Why do you think that Gottlieb’s resignation is cause for cannabis companies to panic? Does it really justify a massive selloff like we saw today? Is it really any cause for concern? The FDA already admits that marijuana has been known for medical use for over 3,000 years despite what the DEA says. Marijuana has unjustly been classified as Schedule 1, 49 years ago. Perhaps 50 years is enough. It is more than likely that next head of the FDA that replaces Gottlieb will not only help fast track cannabis medications but also ease most restrictions on CBD products.

News came out today that AirBnb bought HotelTonight, and it seems like they have a decent future in both owning the entire travel pipeline AND (very) slowly outgrowing the need for hotels (and therefore a greater dependency on AirBnb's services).

I imagine it'd be hard for any competitor to challenge and knock them out, meaning they'd have good and steady revenue with a sustainable future as a public company.

This is in contrast to, say Uber (and to a greater degree Lyft b/c Lyft hasn't expanded into as many verticals), who is decently profitable right now but whose long-term future, as many tech analysts, workers, and some investors put it, depends heavily on which company in the ""car"" sector/industry ""wins"" the autonomous vehicles race (general consensus is that Waymo currently leads the pack, with Cruise second and everyone else dropping off after that).

Give these circumstances, would you guys buy Airbnb stock when available? If so, for the same reasons, or otherwise?

I worked there for a little more than a year and then left. I remember being given a paper to sign at my one-year mark about my options being vested. However, I know I didn’t actually purchase stock or was given the option to. Again, the company was and still is private.

1.80 dividend is coming

its paid on april 14

does this mean... if you purchased the shares after feb 7, but before march 8, you will get the dividend?

also. if you own the shares from january to march 8, then sell the shares on march 15, do you get the dividend?

also. it says ""final dividend"" ... does this mean rio said they are stopping its dividend after this one?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;CHK  deeply undervalued. It was known for being the largest nat gas producer  in the country but nat has tanked thanks to all the associative gas  that is produced with fracking. Anyway CHK has transitioned into a nat  has company that produces oil now.  They have a lot of oil sweet-spots  in their acreage.  
&gt;  
&gt;DNR deeply undervalued  oil company, trades for 1.85 and has 9.00 a share worth of assets.  going through a merger with penn va thats diluting its shareholders. Not  your problem as much as it was my problem. Still a great company that  makes 38 cents in earnings for every dollar invested. High profits are  thanks to prices locked in at higher prices around $68 last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both  these stocks need oil prices to rise from where they are now at $56.   Right now they tread water but they get seriously profitable if oil goes  above $60... Oil should rise because OPEC+ controls 55% of global  production and got hoodwinked by Trump last year into over supplying the  market on Trumps Iran deal (never again, trump!).  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyways  March and April are the strongest seasonal months for oil prices to  rise. The productive economies emerge from winter and start firing on  all cylinders. OPEC+ cut their output in coordinated fashion and the  cuts are now starting to bite.  price is rising this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  drop in the price of oil that cane in 2015  stunted investment in new  supply all over the world. Over $1T of investments in new supply have  NOT been made since 2015. This causes a period of time, about 5 years  where companies that do have productive assets will have maximum  advantage until new supply is developed...  takes years to bring that  on.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHK and DNR are fallen angels from  the S&amp;P 500 and can be long term buys though you might get a good  pop heading into the summer driving season.  Lots of debt in both  companies so no need to margin up on these stocks. The margin is built  in.  
&gt;  
&gt;These are the kind of stocks that  either go to zero or more than double your money. Based on developments  in the oil market, I don’t think they are going to zero. Couldn’t say  that in 2015...

I want to try hedging/shorting a stock whilst leveraged or is it the same thing? lol

No really.

I have some money I'm prepared to lose in this experiment.

There is one share I want to play with, no insider information just watching a tiny part of the market and my spidey sense is tingling . I understand that I can borrow shares off someone, sell it then replace later.

How much do people charge for 'renting out' their stocks?.  This one is about $100 share. I want to borrow 1.

I then want to leverage it 100 times.(so I'm borrowing 100?) I'm putting in a safely net of selling at a 1% increase.

I'll then ride this share down and sell at a target value.

For sake of argument say I start at $100 and cash out at $50.

Leveraged 100 times.

$5000.

Assuming it works and the share doesn't go to $101 to which I cash out and lose my stake.

Who's going to charge me what for doing that?

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

But I know that there are product lines that they dissect revenue/costs into (like search ads, newsfeed, fb stories, instagram stories, etc). In order to best estimate future revenue I think it's best that I first estimate the revenue/margin profiles of existing product lines. What's the best way of going about doing this, or is it worth trying to do at all?

The ideas I have so far are (none are perfect):

* Using given aggregate margin profiles as a start for each relevant product line and guessing higher or lower based on transcripts
* Finding business with similar product lines that do explicitly break down stats, and assume that as the rate for Facebook's products lines. Eg Snapchat runs mostly on stories, use that as a start for stories monetization
* Trying to estimate what costs are necessary for particular product line by removing what I think are temporary costs in historical numbers, that are relevant to that product line
* Taking shots in the dark based off of what is said in transcripts
* Not disaggregating at all, because there's no way I can know for sure

I'm a big fan of Polish gaming studio, CD Projekt Red, developer behind the successful Witcher series. Currently, I am keeping a close eye on their new upcoming game, Cyberpunk 2077. It is currently the most anticipated game in recent memory, pouring in high numbers of views and likes on social media, that are usually reserved for Rockstar games (GTA V etc).

In late 2018, a Polish analyst company predicted ""crazy"" sales for this game (releasing probably in Q4 2019) and adviced investors to buy stocks before the game's release, as the value will probably go up.

I am quite inexperienced here, trying to invest a little myself. How could I buy CD Projekt Red's stocks, if I'm not from Poland, but am an EU citizen?

Long story short, I'm fairly new to investing and bought $ATVI when it was near $70 and I'm looking to average down my cost in them, as I think they'll bounce back long-term.

My real question is what is normally suggested for averaging down stock, if there is any? Do people typically buy half the shares they originally purchased? Equal amount of shares to their first purchase? Or would some say it's not that simple and it's more based on what the companies' expected target price is, balanced with how much cash you have to spend?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 

1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

I've enjoyed r/stocks and reddit in general for investing-based discussions, and want to contribute what I have to offer.  


The stocks here are ordered in decreasing order of the derivative of the 50-day simple moving average (the 'sma50d' column of the following table). In other words, this list in in ordered by the velocity (%/day) of the stock price-curve after smoothing with a 50-day running average. This has been my own personal best tracker of success, and hopefully will be useful for you!   


If you would like to see additional tickers in tomorrow's update, please post their names in the comments. If the community finds this list and the discussions to be beneficial, I will be happy to continue this service.  


Disclaimer: I probably hold positions in some of the top names on this list. Some of the top names might be (significantly) over-valued; use your own judgement when trading and investing.

First would like to say that I am completely beginner and I am trying to get educated how you guys think and would love your opinion.  


Recently I have put big chunk of my capital on CVS and as past 3 days they are going down and specifically today -4%  


As I was reading multiple articles on them and full with bad and possitive news I can not seem to figure out if its worth for me to keep them for a longer term or to get rid of them asap.  


Still think that in a month time or longer they will perform better with releasing some great news but as a newbie I'm scared not to loose over 10%.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 


1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**


I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

First week is in the books! Glad to be back in penny land, its been a while! Pretty solid first week if you ask me. After trading fees being deducted I ended the first week up **$331.19.** I will take that, I know I had a goal of $500 per week but first week back into it, making over $300. I’m comfortable with that start. The stocks I got into this week I felt very confident in and for the most part they played out as expected. Let’s jump in to some more details and breakdowns from this week!

These were the tickers I traded for the week of February 25 2019:

* **BIOC**
* **ONCS**
* **JCP**
* **TRNX**

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty solid first week. Traded 5 times on the week, ONCS twice. 4 winning trades, 1 loser in TRNX. The TRNX the amount allocated in that trade was much lower than all my other trades so the loss was fairly small as I felt that trade was a slightly higher risk. I’m going to breakdown these four trades down below.

&amp;#x200B;

# Trade Highlights

**BIOC** \- This was probably my #1 trade I had my eye on this week. I was loving the chart setup and really felt like this was a lock for at least getting 5%. The stock had a bottom of $0.98-$1.00 and was consistently tapping $1.05 almost daily. I really wanted to stay disciplined and pick up shares at $1.00. I set my limit buy on Monday and it was a very small partial fill of only 390 of my 5,000 shares. This is a lesson in understanding Market vs. Limit orders, you can read more about that here. The Bid on this stock was $1.00 and the Ask was $1.01. I should have market bought my 5,000 shares and would have executed somewhere between $1.00 and $1.01. Let’s just say it market bought at $1.005. That would have cost my $50 more dollars to get full into the trade on 5,000 shares. Instead I only filled 390 shares and sold out at $1.04 for $15 profit and $10 in trading fees. If I had just market bought these I would have been looking at about $200+ in profit instead of $15.

&amp;#x200B;

**ONCS** \- This trade I was not a big fan of once I got into it. I realized fairly quickly that the stock had a fairly decent spread on it, almost 2 and sometimes 3 cents on a sub 60 cent stock. On top of that the volume was light on it. When this popped up on my scanner the average volume was well over 400,000 daily, but it had some recent volume spikes in previous days which skewed that number a bit. This presented myself with a bit of a challenge because when I would set my limit sell it would put a big wall on the Ask and nobody would touch it. I spent Wednesday-Friday working on exiting this position at $0.60. Finally on Friday the bid/ask tightened up to $0.59 and $0.5940. I executed my market sell at $0.5927 and was able to get out and lock in profits. Lesson learned to double check recent bid/ask spreads and last several days of volume before getting in. But hey, still made $150+ on that trade so no complaints.

&amp;#x200B;

**JCP** \- This one was a close second place to how much I loved the chart next to BIOC. The $1.20 support level was very strong and I knew if I could just get a fill on it I would profit. I learned my lesson from BIOC the day before. I tried getting filled at $1.20 on Monday, didn’t hit. Tried getting filled at $1.20 on Tuesday and wasn’t filling. Bid was $1.20, Ask was $1.21. Decided to market buy this one at $1.204. Was able to get a full fill of my 4,000 shares immediately. Stock immediately bounced to $1.22 after I filled. I then knew had I left my limit buy at $1.20 and not canceled and executed the market buy I never would have filled and missed another winner. So glad I learned my lesson rather quickly on that one. Anyways, JCP bounced off $1.20 support and ran 2 days in a row and I exited at $1.27 for about 6% gains. Some may ask, why didn’t you hold through ER? You could have banked! Well yes I could have, I also could have lost a lot of money too. I trade weighing risk vs. Reward and for me, holding through Earnings always carries a much higher risk. If I consistently lock 5% on a trade I will make money and it will compound quickly, I don’t look back after I sold and think oh should have held for bigger gains, that never works out.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRNX** \- This was easily the dumbest trade of the week and I will tell you why. This stock popped up on my screener being very oversold on Wednesday. I only had enough settled funds to buy 1,000 shares. So I figured oh this will probably have a bounce, I’m going to day trade it, so I bought in. I was correct it did have a bounce. I bought in at .6197 and within about 45 mins the stock was at .645. Sweet right? Not really, since I had so little shares and had to account for the $10 in trading fees it was going to cost me, if I sold there I was gonna make like $3 on the trade. Mistake #1, should have just locked in the couple dollar profit. Well I decided to hold for 2 more days, stock slid both days, at that point I was like well I don’t have much invested in this trade so no big deal, but at the same time I’m taking an unnecessary loss because I specifically got in that trade for a day trade, and it played out like I expected yet I am still holding this thing two days later. I didn’t want to go any deeper down that rabbit hole so I exited for a $56 loss.

&amp;#x200B;

## Key Takeaways

Overall, I am pretty happy with the way this week played out. Ended the week up over $300 went 4 out of 5 on my trades. The one loss I kept the risk factor low by not allocating much funds into the trade. A couple things I need to remember or reinforce is ensuring I am reviewing the bid/ask on a stock before entering, that can get me in a tough position as well as double checking recent stock volume over the past week or so to ensure there is enough there to get some price action.

Another thing for me to keep in my mind is weighing how confident I am in a trade and if it warrants me to market buy instead of limit buy a stock. This was outlined very well in the BIOC vs. JCP breakdowns above. I definitely could have come out of this week with a higher profit had I market bought BIOC instead of limit.

I spent Wednesday-Friday working on exiting this position at $0.60. Finally on Friday the bid/ask tightened up to $0.59 and $0.5940. I executed my market sell at $0.5927 and was able to get out and lock in profits. Lesson learned to double check recent bid/ask spreads and last several days of volume before getting in. But hey, still made $150+ on that trade so no complaints.

&amp;#x200B;

**JCP** \- This one was a close second place to how much I loved the chart next to BIOC. The $1.20 support level was very strong and I knew if I could just get a fill on it I would profit. I learned my lesson from BIOC the day before. I tried getting filled at $1.20 on Monday, didn’t hit. Tried getting filled at $1.20 on Tuesday and wasn’t filling. Bid was $1.20, Ask was $1.21. Decided to market buy this one at $1.204. Was able to get a full fill of my 4,000 shares immediately. Stock immediately bounced to $1.22 after I filled. I then knew had I left my limit buy at $1.20 and not canceled and executed the market buy I never would have filled and missed another winner. So glad I learned my lesson rather quickly on that one. Anyways, JCP bounced off $1.20 support and ran 2 days in a row and I exited at $1.27 for about 6% gains. Some may ask, why didn’t you hold through ER? You could have banked! Well yes I could have, I also could have lost a lot of money too. I trade weighing risk vs. Reward and for me, holding through Earnings always carries a much higher risk. If I consistently lock 5% on a trade I will make money and it will compound quickly, I don’t look back after I sold and think oh should have held for bigger gains, that never works out.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRNX** \- This was easily the dumbest trade of the week and I will tell you why. This stock popped up on my screener being very oversold on Wednesday. I only had enough settled funds to buy 1,000 shares. So I figured oh this will probably have a bounce, I’m going to day trade it, so I bought in. I was correct it did have a bounce. I bought in at .6197 and within about 45 mins the stock was at .645. Sweet right? Not really, since I had so little shares and had to account for the $10 in trading fees it was going to cost me, if I sold there I was gonna make like $3 on the trade. Mistake #1, should have just locked in the couple dollar profit. Well I decided to hold for 2 more days, stock slid both days, at that point I was like well I don’t have much invested in this trade so no big deal, but at the same time I’m taking an unnecessary loss because I specifically got in that trade for a day trade, and it played out like I expected yet I am still holding this thing two days later. I didn’t want to go any deeper down that rabbit hole so I exited for a $56 loss.

&amp;#x200B;

### Key Takeaways

Overall, I am pretty happy with the way this week played out. Ended the week up over $300 went 4 out of 5 on my trades. The one loss I kept the risk factor low by not allocating much funds into the trade. A couple things I need to remember or reinforce is ensuring I am reviewing the bid/ask on a stock before entering, that can get me in a tough position as well as double checking recent stock volume over the past week or so to ensure there is enough there to get some price action.

Another thing for me to keep in my mind is weighing how confident I am in a trade and if it warrants me to market buy instead of limit buy a stock. This was outlined very well in the BIOC vs. JCP breakdowns above. I definitely could have come out of this week with a higher profit had I market bought BIOC instead of limit.

Anyways, thats my post for this first week, pretty excited to get Week 2 underway tomorrow! Still keeping my weekly goal of $500 per week. Hopefully when I write this post up next week my account is over $11,000! Looking forward to hearing everyones thoughts and comments on this!

so from that. it seems...

1.80 dividend is coming

its paid on april 14

Hi everyone. Here's some strategies I've had success with in picking stocks. I wish someone would have posted this for me when I got started. Let me know what you think.

PEG &lt; 1

Make sure PE and Forward PE look good.

Price/book is low relative to similar companies. By choosing a low priced stock, if gives you a higher margin for error.

Only buy stocks in the USA, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore. A lot of countries out there do not have the same accounting regulations we do. China is an example of this.

Buy companies with lower debt than others in the same industry. A good reference for this is the current ratio. This ratio shows the amount of short term assets divided by the amount of short term debt. Look through previous years and if the current ratio is getting better every year, that is a good sign. Also if long term debt/equity has been shrinking over the years, that is also a very good sign.

Growing revenue or sales is a must. Also making sure a company isn't super dependent on sales in one division or product. It's good to have multiple products doing well.

If COGS of a percentage of revenue is rising then it could be a bad sign. This would mean there is less demand or prices are going up for supplies.

If gross profit margin is steady for years, that's a good sign.

High ROE compared to industry and increasing ROE is a good sign.

Insider buying is always good a bonus.

If the short float percent is high then you could benefit from a short squeeze. You just have to make sure that there isn't a super terrible reason behind the company having a lot of short interest.

Also, ask yourself some basic questions like; Can this company raise prices and still keep demand? Can the company sell more that what is currently selling? Can the company increase its profit margins?

These are all important questions when considering a company to buy. You want to make sure this is a company that you plan on holding for a long time.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,328413,public,self,Stock picking strategy (let me know what you think),1553978630,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aww4p3/stock_picking_strategy_let_me_know_what_you_think/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a beginner in investing, and yesterday had the chance to attend a seminar about it. Some of the companies were looking to raise a capital, and offered us to buy Bonds with 3-5year contract and FIXED return between 35-45%. One of the companies was about digital currencies mining and offered 100% on the value in different digital currencies + 24% interest for 3 years. I wonder what is the difference between Private and Public bonds, as those offers I heard yesterday they sound absolutely unreal and I have the feeling that there is a catch with them. Got introduced to 4 companies and all of them had similar interest rates and offered a great deals (at least on my point of view), but as I said I'm just a beginner.

And how does a company keep buying back stock? Isn’t there only so much to buy back? Eventually they’d have to start selling stock in order to buy it back, and I doubt they could keep up the rate of buybacks when they have less to buy back.

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 4th, 2019.

# **The week ahead: Jobs report needs to silence rising worries about the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/01/the-week-ahead-jobs-report-needs-to-silence-rising-worries-about-the-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; Job growth has remained vibrant despite the slow-growing economy,and that's a trend investors are anxious to see confirmed in the February employment report on Friday.
*****
&gt; Even with some economists expecting growth around 1 percent for the first quarter, the labor market has been strong, and economists expect to see 185,000 jobs added in February. The economy is widely expected to bounce back in the second quarter to a pace well above 2 percent, after the temporary headwinds from the government shutdown and polar vortex abate.
*****
&gt; The jobs data tops the list of important economic news in the week ahead, particularly after a string of disappointing reports showing that both consumers and businesses have pulled back.
*****
&gt; The stock market will pass a major milestone on Wednesday—the tenth anniversary of the day the market bottomed in 2009, when the S&amp;P 500 hit 666. The S&amp;P has gained more than 312 percent since that low of the financial crisis, and some analysts see the bull market continuing for at least another year.
*****
&gt; ""We think there's further upside for this bull market to go. The age of the bull does not matter. What really matters is how healthy it is,"" said Patrick Palfrey, U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ""Whatever the concerns, around trade tariffs, or decelerating corporate profits, we believe this bull market remains very healthy.""
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is taking aim at the 2,800 level, an important milestone that it has struggled to surpass in the past week. The 2,800 marker was an important level for the stock market four times in past several months, and holding above it could signal the rally could drive stocks to fresh highs.
*****
&gt; Palfrey said investors first and foremost are looking at any information that can help them gauge how the economy is doing. ""We're looking for confirmation in the jobs report. We think the economy is doing okay. Labor participation is improving. We're going to see that continuing to inch back up,"" he said.
*****
&gt; The Citigroup economic surprise index fell to a new 18-month low Friday, following a recent rash of disappointing reports. When economic reports come in below economists' expectations, the surprise index falls and a low number for the index is reflecting the economic slowdown.
*****
&gt; Source: Citigroup
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs economists Friday said they were expecting first quarter growth of just 0.9 percent, but they raised second quarter growth to 2.9 percent.
*****
&gt; #New home sales
&gt; In addition to the jobs report, there is the Fed's beige book on the economy Wednesday and new home sales Tuesday. But after delayed and weaker data, it's the jobs report that matters most. The employment report is one data point that has been released as normal through the shutdown, and in the January data, there was a huge upside surprise of 304,000 nonfarm payrolls.
*****
&gt; ""All eyes are on the job market. If businesses lose faith and they stop hiring, and job growth starts slowing, then we do have problems,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Economists expect wages to rise by 0.3 percent and unemployment to fall a tenth to 3.9 percent, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; ""I think companies should stay steadfast in their hiring,"" Zandi said. He expects job growth of about 200,000 but notes there could be a payback for the huge amount of hires in January.
*****
&gt; ""I think the economy is fragile, growth is below trend. It's very vulnerable. The only thing that will keep it together is if businesses keep hiring and the job market holds up, and I think it will unless the president doesn't settle with the Chinese on trade, or there's a hard Brexit or some other geopolitical event,"" said Zandi.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve has paused in its interest rate hiking because of the slowing economy and concerns about financial conditions. But the Fed could move forward on rates again, if inflation begins to pick up, and for that reason the wage data in the jobs report would also be key were it to show new wage pressures.
*****
&gt; There are a few speeches by Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who speaks at Stanford University Friday night at an economic conference.
*****
&gt; Market focus will also be on the European Central Bank which meets Thursday.
*****
&gt; ""I think people are expecting some detail about a long-term loan operation,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. The ECB is expected to allow European banks to extend the duration of some short-term loans. Chandler said the ECB could also push back on its time frame on raising interest rates, which it has said would not be until after the summer.

# Typical March Trading: Mid-Month Surge and Flat

&gt; Over the recent 21 years March has been a solid performing month for the market. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.29% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.0% by Russell 2000. March has also been the #1 performing month by average performance for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 over the last 21 years. First trading day of March gains typically kick of the month, followed by choppy to slightly higher trading until around the tenth or eleventh trading day when the market tends to surge higher until around the fifteenth trading day. At this point the market tends to cool and can succumb to some end-of-quarter selling pressure.

# Bad Q4 Not A Bad Sign

&gt; Now that the 4th quarter market debacle is behind us and solid gains have been logged in 2019 year-to-date we have taken a deeper dive into market action following Q4 losses for the three main U.S. market indices. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been solid over the next for the next four quarters and the next year when Q1 is positive, but also good following all but three subsequent Q1 losses. On average up about 80% of the time for the full year with average gains around 8%. NASDAQ’s record is choppier.

I recently have been interested in investing and I've been targeting low cost/ high dividend yield companies. 

BKEP is one stock I've been following and recently they took a plunge in stock price value. As of today, March 1, 2019  the stock is trading at $1.18, which is down from $2.21 as of February 1, 2019. I have not seen any news that could be that harmful to cause this. Can anyone point me to potential news I've missed?

Also, they pay an extremely favorable dividend yield 27.18% annually, which seems to be high compared to  market standards. Why is that? What do they hope to achieve? 

Note: Even though I follow stocks, I feel as if I know nothing about valuing that stock. I have a educational background in finance, but have never advanced it beyond college into application. I'm really interested in learning the true ""nuts &amp; bolts"" of how to value a stock, as an investor, and how the market gets it's pricing of that stock, along with what information is key in the financial statements to look for.

Like everyone else, if you could just inform me of what Alpha is exactly, I'd be happy as well. (Joke)

Thank you and happy Friday!

** NOTE**
I wouldn't buy IFF today.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 


1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

In my last post, I totally forgot to include $TTD among a few others which I was also bullish on. TTD is **up almost 37% since original post and hit a new ATH this week.**

&gt;WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. And Larry Ellison's done a fantastic job with Oracle. I mean I've followed it from the standpoint of reading about it. But I felt like I didn't understand the business. Then, after I started buying it, I felt I still didn't understand the business. I actually changed my mind in terms of understanding and not in terms of evaluating it. I think, I mean, Oracle is a great business. But I don't think, particularly after my experience with IBM, I don't think I understand exactly where the cloud is going. You know, I've been amazed at what Amazon has done there. And now Microsoft is doing it as well.

analytical product [Netflow2](https://www.moex.com/en/analyticalproducts?netflow2) providing aggregated positions by trader groups at Russian stock market. The product may give an edge in trading and could help outperform the market, it is not exposured yet and staying undiscovered.\n\nHow much alpha could be extracted from the dataset? We will dive in and try to build profit-generating models.\n\n## Dataset\n\nDataset is updated on daily basis. MOEX provides historical data for the period of 2014–2017 to get aqcuitained with the product.\n\nDataset includes intraday aggregate positions (buy sell difference) of top 30, 70 and 100 clients for ten popular Russian stocks. Sample rows:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/uk9jvky1w9j21.png\n\n*You can find a full description of Netflow2 product and get historical values on MOEX* [*website*](https://www.moex.com/en/analyticalproducts?netflow2)\n\n## Methodology\n\nFrom product description follows that positions of all clients are accumulated throughout a trading day and sorted by their absolute values. Netflow2 provides the aggregate position values for the top 30, 70 and 100 clients before the market close at 18:30 MSK. Obviously, the total position of all clients are equals to zero.\n\nThe list of equities available in product:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5xr7j863w9j21.png\n\nFurther, we will consider **SBER** data, results of other 9 equities are given below in appendix. Our dataset is limited by period of 2014–2017 and was taken from MOEX.\n\n## Data overview\n\nStatistical description of pv30, pv70 and pv100 values of SBER dataset:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/sloajlt4w9j21.png\n\nTime-series and distribution plot of pv30, pv70 and pv100 values:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/rkijtow8w9j21.png\n\nAll three pv values are strongly correlated (&gt; 0.95) among themselves and distributed close to normal with a center near zero. pv30 has the largest interquartile range.\n\nLet’s look at SBER price and cumulative sum of pv100:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zdgsyt8fw9j21.png\n\nThere is high correlation of \\~0.8 between the intraday return on an asset and intraday pv values. Therefore, we may assume that the price is moved by clients accumulating large positions. Correlation between the tomorrow’s price movement and today’s pv values is \\~0.1; that means a weak relationship, but nevertheless we may try to forecast tomorrow’s price movement based on today’s pv value.\n\n## Building trading\xa0model\n\nLet’s build a simple trading model assuming that one trade will be executed once a day in the closing auction period depending on the pv value. If today’s pv value is greater than zero (pv &gt; 0), we assume that the price will increase tomorrow, or decrease otherwise. The pv values are compared with zero as its average and median values are close to zero. Its assumed that client group accumulating large position today will continue accumulating tomorrow and the price will move in the direction of the position.\n\n**Model assumptions:**\n\n1. Only pv values are used in model. Asset price and volume info is not used\n2. We open position at 18:30–18:50 MSK at the closing auction and close position the next day at the same time. Single trade in a day\n3. If pv &gt; 0, open long position. If pv &lt; 0, open short position\n4. If two or more days pv value is positive/negative successively just hold existing position\n5. Brokerage fee for trade is 0.025%\n6. Daily returns calculated as close to close\n\nDecission making scheme:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/y90hgzqgw9j21.png\n\n## Trading model\xa0results\n\nLet’s compare total returns of «Buy&amp;Hold» (Base) strategy and trading model based on pv30, pv70 and pv100 values on 4 years run:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7xd6fzyiw9j21.png\n\n&gt;RETURN\u200a—\u200atotal return for 4 years periodSHARPE\u200a—\u200aSharpe coefficient, risk free rate rf = 6%CAGR\u200a—\u200aCompound Annnual Growth RateMAX DRAWDOWN\u200a—\u200amaximum loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attainedTRADES\u200a—\u200anumber of tradesGAIN/LOSS DAYS\u200a—\u200anumber of days when price movement was predicted right/wrong\n\nFollowing pv100 value for four years we could get 187% total return (annualized return 30%), making 462 trades or 1 trade in 2 days on the average. Number of days when price movement was predicted right/wrong about equal, but because of right predicted days have larger price movement amplitude we get positive return.\n\n«Buy&amp;Hold» vs pv driven strategy in dynamics:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5c60lwikw9j21.png\n\nQuarterly comparison:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/r9mlh43mw9j21.png\n\nSimilar results for the other 9 equties can be found in appendix below\n\n## Stock portfolio\n\nWhat about constructing a portfolio? We will take given 10 equities with following weights {SBER: 0.25; GAZP, LKOH: 0.15; GMKN, MGNT: 0.1, ROSN, ALRS, SBERP, AFLT, VTBR: 0.05} and compare «Buy&amp;Hold» vs pv driven strategy. Such stock weights in the portfolio taken according to the trading activity\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/yp9gbhiqw9j21.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStock portfolio driven by pv value makes 35% (annualized return) and has minimal drawdown of 8%.\n\n## Results and following steps\n\nAt this stage we get acquainted with proprietary data Netflow2 and made simple trading model.\n\nThe model considered above made a higher returns than «Buy&amp;Hold» strategy on most stocks, but nevertheless we had a large drawdowns on particular stocks. Constructing a porfolio of 10 stocks solved drawdown issue and finally we got a good return \\~35% (CAGR) with minimal drawdown \\~8%.\n\nOn the following steps we will:\n\n* Go deeper into the data and try to find decisive insights\n* Create direved features\n* Use standart market data, such as price and volume info\n* Make more complex models\n\nOn the other hand, probably we can get the dataset for 2018 and look at performance of simple models\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you have any questions or ideas, please welcome, let’s discuss.

I would not say I am in anyway a ""pro"" at investing stocks. 21 yrs old and I currently have about 5k in a Wealthsimple TFSA growth portfolio account. Its made me little over 9% (money weighted) since i deposited $2k in 1 year- and another $3k 6 months ago. Apparently I've avoided about $270 of fees according to Wealthsimple although I do not know the break down of these fees that I've actually saved (Are these purchasing fees, conversion fees to USD, management fee?). I deposited 5k because I have the $5000 fees voided bonus for signing up. I also have a 20k balance in their ""high savings account"" and its earned about 30$ a month. The reason why i have the majority of my money in a savings account is because I was not educated enough about investing and money managing as I am now. I also have a Questrade TFSA account in which i have 3k in which I buy individual stocks (play money).

March is around the corner and I will lose these voided fees on Wealthsimple, so it made me think. ETFs and ECNs are free on Questrade, and I am confident I have the confidence to not ""panic sell"" or over hold cash. I have read around and I am confident I can calculate, balance and re-balance 2/3 times a year.

What are some downsides to taking the 20k + 5k from my Wealthsimple account and dumping it into my Questrade account, buying the same 5 ETFs that my current portfolio has, avoiding the management fee of 0.5% stated on Wealthsimple's website. This way I can also have all my money in 1 account and not have to sign in to 3 different accounts to manage my money.

Would this decision really be about whether or not I believe paying approx 0.5% of $25000 (\~$125) annually is worth the management and auto balancing of this account. Maybe taking into consideration the fee of selling (selling and converting USD stocks to CAD$) transferring it into Questrade and paying another conversion fee CAD to USD$ would this no longer be ""saving"" me money, let alone time/effort.

Thanks in advanced for financial advice.

EDIT:

The 5 ETFs currently in this portfolio with 5k is

1. CRBN 26.8% (I approve of this)
2. XEN 22.9% (I approve of this)
3. ZFM 19.9% (I disapprove of this) - I could remove this (or lower the allocation) and invest in another ETF of my choice. I believe i can also talk to Wealthsimple to remove this and change it.
4. PZD 15.5% (I approve of this)
5.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 
1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**
I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

&amp;#x200B;

I am turning 30 this year and want to make sure I am investing correctly in my IRA and self-directly 401K account.  I want to see if there are any suggestions to doing anything differently.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I make about $200K a year in the Bay Area but with a newborn, high mortgage, property taxes, and other HCOL expenses, we can only contribute roughly 10-15% of our earnings to our 401K plan.  She does not have a self-directly 401K plan so she is not allowed to invest in stocks like I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

My IRA and 401K accounts are valued at roughly $93K as of today.  My holdings are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) AAPL - 100 shares

2) FB - 75 shares

3) GE - 70 shares

4) JD - 100 shares

5) JPM - 100 shares

6) MSFT - 100 shares

7) T - 200 shares

8) UPS - 35 shares

9) VFINX - \~47 shares

10) AMD - 100 shares

11) XOM - 50 shares

12) KIM - 100 shares

13) DIS - 50 shares

&amp;#x200B;

Watchlist:

Visa

Schwab ETFs

Vanguard MFs

&amp;#x200B;

I want to slowly diversify my holdings into other S&amp;P500 and large cap growth mutual funds, but want to see if I should do things differently. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also selling IQOS as some kind of health push ""away"" from their current tobacco market bothers me, I don't think they should be arguing about the morality of what they're doing, it's proven to be a losing argument long term.

My current theory is that tobacco use trending downwards is already priced in very well, while the probability of leveraging their position to become a major player in the cannabis market has been downplayed due to extreme valuations of companies like Canopy.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Nio has been posted in this sub many times over the past few months and now it's starting to get more national recognition. With the stock soaring above $10 today (above it's IPO) for the first time. Seems like it is trading off of momentum right now. With the combination of trade negotiations between US-China and Tesla-SEC debacle, this 60 minutes special causing the boost couldn't have been timed better.

**HOW I USE THIS:** 


1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**
I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

HOW I USE THIS: I go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.

Welcome to my weekly Stock Trading Diary! I will be starting this trading journey on February 25th 2019. My broker will be Schwab and I will have a starting account balance of **$10,244.31**. I wanted to outline my plan, goals and more in this first post but what you can expect in my future posts is reviewing and recapping my week every week. That means discussing my profit/loss for the week, my trade breakdowns and what went well and what didn't go well and what my expectations are for the following week. Just to preface this a little bit, I have been trading for a little over 7 years and focus specifically on technical analysis when executing my trades. I hope you enjoy this weekly journey and feel free to provide any thoughts or feedback you may have!

I'm back! It's been quite a while since I have traded penny stocks or stocks in general for that matter. I really enjoy the ability to trade lower priced stocks as I am usually looking for a 5-10% move and then I am out and on to the next one. One of the benefits of trading stocks especially coming from the option world as of late is not having to worry about time decay. Essentially when trading naked options you need to pick the direction and the time in which it takes for that direction to take place correctly. With stocks you just need to pick the correct direction and don't need to worry about the time it takes to get there.

Back when I was trading penny stocks heavily in 2017 I took my account from $5,500 to $21,000. Looking to start strong and have similar success starting on February 25th 2019. To provide you with an idea of what I have planned, I will be playing a lot of stocks at a major support level as well as stocks setting up for a Bollinger Band Squeeze. This plays tend to me the most successful for me on a day to day basis. I will also be playing some Ichimoku as well as some T Line Crunch plays if they present themselves.

### Personal Rules/Goals

1. Allocate 50% of overall portfolio per trade (I generally trade a little more aggressively with stocks because they are slow moving so I am less worried about taking a large loss in the account)
2. Look to exit trade in the 5%-10% range
3. Having a stop loss at 10% or less to limit losses
4. Maintain an 85%+ win rate
5. Scan for trades nightly and wait for ideal setups
6. Provide weekly updates to this diary outlining progress week over week
7. My weekly goal to start will be a net profit of $500 per week

I look forward to documenting this journey and getting started this next week. As stated earlier I will be trading with a Schwab account that has a starting balance of **$10,244.31**. I will include a screenshot below of my current account size so you can follow along as we go on this journey together.

Hey everyone,

So,  I had an idea that I felt was too good to be true. Here's the concept:  Let's say you wanted to invest in a monthly dividend stock. The issue  here is that you don't have enough free money to make it immediately  worth the dividend. Let's make the example that you had $40k invested in  a mutual fund, so you could use some of it, but you don't want to touch  it. Conceptually, you could take out a $10k personal loan and you are  free to do whatever you wanted with it, including investing. I mention  the $40k as a means to fully pay off the loan if you ABSOLUTELY had to  at once. Here's the math that I thought made it worth it:

The stock: AGNC. It's dividend for the past 3 years has been $.18 per month.

The  loan: $10k at 8.99% for 3 years. This is a monthly payment of $318, and  total interest over the life of the loan is   $1,446. Assume excellent  credit and the ability to make this payment at no cost to other savings  or expenses.

At about a $9 commission,  you buy 564 shares of the stock with some change left over.  (9991/current price (17.71)=\~564.14, or 564 rounded down)

The  monthly dividend comes out to $101.52 per month (564\*.18). Or $1,218.24  a year. Over the life of the loan, this would be $3654.72 (1,218.24\*3),  assuming the dividend stays at a monthly rate and retains the amount  per share. If you wanted to get crazy, you could do the exact same thing  to double your stock 3 years later, and make even more money in  dividends.

Since  the total amount you make in dividends is greater than the extra you  pay in interest, is this a good return on investment with a loan? I know  there are risks, including the stock price falling dramatically (but if  you wanted the stock for dividends only (cash, no reinvestment), price  shouldn't matter, right?), or the dividend being cut, or the dividend  becoming a quarterly dividend instead of monthly. Is there anything I'm  not considering? How risky is this?

Disclaimer: I have no related positions. Just looking for reasons why this might be a terrible idea, as I can't see any more risk beyond what I outlined.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,326297,public,self,Dividend Stock with Personal Loan?,1553252901,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aubvr1/dividend_stock_with_personal_loan/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some investors believe that when a CFO leaves, it's time to sell the stock. That appears to be the view that some shareholders are taking with Editas, creating downward pressure on the biotech's share price. 

If there's more behind Hack's departure that should cause alarm for investors, it's likely to come out soon. Again, I don't think this will happen.

They generate $16B in revenue per year in 2018 from users worldwide.

&amp;#x200B;

Their total revenue generated is $55B though, considering Facebook generates the majority from advertising I would have thought that APRU should be closer to $55B and not $16B.  


Can anyone explain to me why they are not nearly equal?

I personally believe the corporate tax rate over the next 15-20 years back to levels seen in the 50-90's which ranged in the  from 35-52.8% which would be a large rise from the current 21%. With the current sentiment of people being more of corps are being overly greedy and screwing the average person. The political leaning of young people is also more tilted toward the left opposed to those who are dying that are more likely to be republicans. 

&amp;#x200B;

A secondary issue I personally could see causing an issue is the amount of student debt college students around me have. I know many people who expect to or will be 30-50k in debt by the end of college and these loan repayments will be  a significant portion of their income post college. This worries me on two fronts. 1. Less disposable income to spend as well as many being government loans these repayments won't be going to any public company or into the economy. With less disposable income people will have less to spend in general even on simple day to day activities such as dining, fun, phones, etc. etc.

2. Getting home loans seemingly will be much more difficult as people have this debt in their name from a young age.

- Cheated on his wife.  Not cool, but I'm not going to be judgmental here.    Lot's of shit can happen behind the scene in a marriage.

- Amazon is know to push its workers to the limit for the sake of efficiency.

- Bezos said that the aviation industry is expensive because it highly prioritize reliability.  Thus in his quest for efficiency Amazon de-prioritize reliability.

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 25th, 2019.

# **Next week will be pivotal for markets with trade deadline, Powell, Trump-Kim and more  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/22/next-week-will-be-pivotal-for-markets-with-trade-deadline-powell-trump.html)**
*****
&gt; The coming week could be one of the most pivotal for the Trump White House and the markets, depending on how President Donald Trump chooses to proceed with China trade tariffs.
*****
&gt; U.S.-China trade talks apparently have been making progress, and in a positive sign, sources said a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is being discussed for late March. Strategists expect some eventual deal to be reached, but first and foremost, the March 2 deadline on new tariffs looms at the end of the week. For now, it looks like the deadline could be extended.
*****
&gt; Trump, in fact, Friday reiterated that he could extend the deadline if progress is being made. He also said there was a very good chance a deal could be reached with China, and that he and Xi would make the big decisions.
*****
&gt; The week is packed with major events that could be market moving, including two days of economic testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. He appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, and then a House committee Wednesday for the semiannual testimony.
*****
&gt; Trump also heads to Vietnam for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday and Thursday, and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May faces another Brexit vote in parliament.
*****
&gt; The markets are also closely watching U.S. economic data after a string of misses on manufacturing and consumer data rattled stocks in the past couple of weeks. The lack of government data during the 35-day government shutdown has made it more difficult than usual to get a handle on the economy, and some economists now see fourth-quarter and first-quarter growth running at just 2 percent or below. Fourth-quarter GDP, delayed because of the shutdown, is finally released on Thursday.
*****
&gt; **Earnings**
&gt; Though earnings season is winding down, quite a few earnings releases are expected, including from retailers Home Depot, Macy'sand Nordstrom.
*****
&gt; ""To me, the biggest story next week for markets is China. Do they announce an agreement or do they at least extend the deadline? That's the one that has the most immediate market impact. The markets are pricing in good news on China next week,"" said Tom Block, Washington policy strategist at Fundstrat.
*****
&gt; There were some news reports that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Trump campaign and Russia would be provided to the attorney general next week, but a Justice Department official Friday afternoon said that was not true.Whether the Trump campaign was involved with Russia or not matters much less than whether the president himself was involved.
*****
&gt; ""This is of course great for American political drama but as for the $4.3 trillion foreign exchange market or what does this mean for the value of corporate America, it's not a big deal unless there's a smoking gun, and people think Trump is going to get impeached,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ""Why this is important is it might paralyze other policy. … The only way it is a really big factor is if it's used as fodder to pursue further investigations that paralyze the administration like Watergate did.""
*****
&gt; Chandler said while the geopolitical events in the coming week could add to tension, they could all remain unresolved.
*****
&gt; ""We want some closure. Next week is not going to bring some closure. We're going to get extensions,"" said Chandler.
*****
&gt; The uncertainty around China trade has been impacting the economic data, and business leaders have called on the White House to end the tariffs on China. The farm belt has been hurt as China retaliated against U.S. products.
*****
&gt; Cowen analysts said the talks are nearing a ""term sheet"" between Chinese and U.S. trade negotiators. The memorandums are expected to touch on a half-dozen key areas, including forced technology transfers and cybertheft; intellectual property rights; opening up of Chinese financial services to U.S. companies; currency; agriculture, and nontariff barriers to trade. Those barriers include industrial subsidies, licensing procedures and other regulations.
*****
&gt; The talks are also expected to focus on a list of 10 goods and commodities that China will buy to help narrow the trade balance. That could include an additional $30 billion per year of U.S. farm products including soybeans, corn, and wheat, the Cowen analysts said.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat's Block said the president understands the political impact of continuing tariffs or raising them to 25 percent by March 2, as he has threatened.
*****
&gt; **Trade deadline, North Korea, Brexit**
&gt; Trump has said the deadline could be extended. ""The road to 270 electoral votes for Trump goes through the farm states of the Midwest. There's no road map for Trump to get 270 electoral votes if he doesn't carry all those Midwestern farm states,"" Block said. ""China is very big for lots of reasons. …Trump's people have to figure out, at a minimum, how to extend the truce. … The biggest threat to those states is continued trade war with China focused on agricultural products exported from the U.S.""
*****
&gt; Besides China and trade and the Mueller report, Trump plans to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam in the week ahead, and Trump has said it is not to be his last meeting with Kim. The U.S. and North Korea are expected to seek a common understanding of what is expected in denuclearization, and Trump is expected to push Kim to give up his nuclear ambitions.
*****
&gt; Block said it's unclear what will come of those talks. ""Trump overstates what he does, but the world is a little safer with us talking with North Korea rather than saber rattling with North Korea. That seems to be Trump's approach. Regardless of what his thought process is, the net result is better than not doing it,"" said Block.
*****
&gt; Investors are also looking to Europe where the U.K. Parliament votes on a no-deal Brexit, which critics say would disrupt trade and commerce .
*****
&gt; Prime Minister Theresa May continues to push for Britain's exit from the European Union on March 29. On Wednesday, there will be a vote on an amendment that would give the House of Commons the power to block a no-exit deal if May has not secured the approval by Parliament for a revised Brexit deal by the middle of March.
*****
&gt; ""They're trying to force her to give up the no deal exit. The EU is expecting a request for a 60-day extension,"" said Chandler.
*****
&gt; **Economic data**
&gt; As for U.S. data, reports on personal income and spending are coming on Friday and fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. December's disappointing durable goods data showed slower business spending, so analysts are watching closely to see whether there was any improvement in consumer spending.
*****
&gt; ""The U.S. growth slowdown is seen intensifying in the first quarter too. We forecast U.S. GDP growth at a modest 1.5% annual rate in Q1. Slowing global manufacturing activity, tighter financial conditions, sluggish business equipment spending, and lackluster federal government spending (due in part to the government shutdown in January) are all contributing to the weakest quarter for U.S. growth in two years,"" wrote Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.
*****
&gt; Anderson expects fourth-quarter growth at 2.2 percent. He also said if uncertainties in the U.S. around China trade talks and the Brexit negotiations go away, there is a good chance U.S. economic growth will bounce back in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; ""I should note this is our base case forecast, as none of the parties involved in the negotiations want to see the worst case outcomes realized. If for some reason either of the negotiations go seriously off-track, however, the 2019 U.S. and global economic outlook will become considerably bleaker,"" he wrote.

# Pre-Election Year March: Small-Caps Perfect 10 for 10

&gt; Turbulent March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.

&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March performs even better in pre-election years (see Vital Statistics table below). In pre-election years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 1000 (January, April and December are better). Pre-election year March rank #3 for Russell 2000. Pre-election year March has been up 13 out of the last 14 for DJIA. In fact, since inception in 1979, the Russell 2000 has a perfect, 10-for-10 winning record.

# When Is Overbought Bullish?

&gt; What more can we say about the amazing rebound of the stock market since December 24? For the first time since 1997, the S&amp;P 500 Index is up more than 10% for the year through this point in February. Of course, it was the worst December for stocks since the Great Depression—making a larger bounce possible—but the rebound over the past two months has been historic.

&gt; That begs the question: What does it mean when stocks are overbought on many short-term levels? “Yes, stocks are quite extended near -term,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “but historically, extended markets have tended to deliver continued outperformance over the next several months.”

&gt; We can see this by looking at the number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are above their 50-day moving average and the subsequent performance of the index. That number recently cleared 90%, which was one of the highest readings ever. And after 90% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 go above their 50-day moving average, their 1-, 3-, and 6-month returns actually have shown continued strength. In fact, as the LPL Chart of the Day shows, three months after hitting that 90% mark, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher 12 of the previous 13 times going back to 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Overbought-Can-be-a-Good-Thing.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; This tells us the easy part of the recent rally is over, and we do see reasons to expect some type of consolidation or well-deserved pullback at some point, but we still think the stage is potentially set for new highs later this year.

# More Good News

&gt; As this week’s Weekly Market Commentary suggested, over the near term equities appear quite stretched, but overall we continue to think the bull market has plenty of life left. Today, we’ll take a look at market breadth—one of our favorite technical indicators—to explore whether it may be pointing to better times ahead for equities.

&gt; Market breadth measures how many stocks are participating in the movement of broader indexes. One of the easiest ways to measure this is via advance/decline (A/D) lines on various exchanges. An A/D line is a ratio of how many stocks go up versus down each day. The thinking is, if gains are caused by increases in many stocks, then there are plenty of buyers and the upward trend should likely continue, all else equal. On the other hand, if an upward move in a broad market gauge is driven by relatively few stocks, this can be a warning sign of cracks in the bull’s armor.

&gt; Today’s LPL Chart of the Day shows that the NYSE Common Stock Only A/D line has broken out to a new all-time high. “This is another clue to market participants that things are actually quite healthy under the surface. When advance/decline lines are breaking out to new highs, history tells us that stocks usually aren’t too far behind,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

# Broad Based Breadth

&gt; One aspect of the rally in stocks this year that we can’t stress enough is how strong breadth has been. Besides the fact that the equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 is outperforming the market cap weighted index by close to three percentage points YTD, the vast majority of S&amp;P 500 Industry Groups are also either right at or very close to YTD highs. The table below lists S&amp;P 500 Industry Groups that, along with the S&amp;P 500, hit YTD highs so far today. Of the 60 Industry Groups, 26 hit YTD highs today and five of them are already up 20% YTD!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/022219-Groups-Hitting-YTD-Highs.png))**

&gt; In addition to the 26 Industry Groups above, another 16 Industry Groups traded within 1% of a YTD high today and three of those are also up over 20% YTD. Adding both lists together, 70% of S&amp;P 500 Industry Groups either traded at or came within 1% of hitting a YTD high this morning. That’s broad!

If the penalties for these violations result in a 90 day restriction to trade with only settled funds, how is this disadvantageous?

I find BOX Inc to be significantly undervalued from a growth standpoint. On a cash flow basis, BOX is currently overvalued but the growth potential significantly outweighs this factor in my eyes. Q4 earnings are posted 2/27/2019 after-hours. 


Box Inc. is a leader in cloud content management and powers more than 80,000 businesses globally and 69% of the fortune 500. In total, Box has around 44 million users (Paid &amp; Unpaid) as of September 2018. Box is currently partnered with some of the largest companies in the world which provides them with unbelievable growth opportunity. These partners include Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Google, SalesForces, AT&amp;T, Okta, Workplace, Adobe and now Amazon through AWS. By partnering, Box is able to tap into the more than $45B these companies have spent on R&amp;D and further grow their own business. They are managing to grow sales at a rate of 20% per year compounded (96% recurring) and they have been for many years. They are projected to continue this cycle for FY 2018, 2019 and beyond. They are maintaining an incredibly low churn rate of 5% and a net customer retention rate of 109% all while billings growth is up 10% YOY. They have the ability to cross sell products which I believe gives them significant pricing power and stability in their current markets. Box believes the current Cloud Content Management market provides a $45B+ opportunity for them and companies like them. 


I beleive Box Inc. is a well positioned play on Cloud Content Mangement and AI. My current strategy for BOX is to buy on all dips (assuming there is no major bad news) and continue to hold BOX for as long as I can and hope they don't get bought out.

My Strategy
I buy and hold stock until the company’s financials deteriorate, I find a better investment, or the company becomes overvalued according to my criteria. My longest holding period has been 2 years and running. If one of my holdings goes down, I look at it as an opportunity to buy more at a discount. My current holdings are BOX, ATIS, LOGM, MIK. Do your own research before buying into any of my recommendations.

This news included SEC investigations for malpractices, dividend slashes, and massive losses. It is now trading at $35 down from its all-time high of $90. 

How to react to this news? Throughout history the common thing that always happens is that the majority of investors overreact to news. They buy high when the news is good and sell low as the news is bad. Investors like Warren Buffett know this and buy good companies when the price is low. ""Be greedy when others are fearful. Be fearful when others are greedy.""

What makes a good company? Solid profits that can be relied on for years to come. Kraft Heinz has a P/E ratio of near 10. That's a very high level of income for the stock. And its main product, food, is a reliable source of income for Heinz, unlike the products in the tech industry which are subject to massive ups and downs and fierce competition.

Because of the overreaction of the investors on Wall Street, and Heinz continuing to be a high-income company, against the majority of so-called ""expert"" analysts and Wall Street pundits, I rate Kraft Heinz Co a strong buy.

1) The size of the stock market itself, [in such case IBM comes out on top](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/05/your-money/apple-market-share.html) as it represented 6.7% of the entire stock market, but the stock market itself was smaller as it accounted for just 2303 companies.

2) Market cap as % of US GDP . If that's the case then it's Microsoft which comes out on top . Math is easy . 

- MSFT market cap was 619B in Dec 1999, US GDP in 1999 was 10T. So MSFT market cap was 6,19% of US GDP . 

- IBM at 37B in JAN 1970 , US GDP was 1 trillion in 1969 , again math is easy: 3.7% of US GDP

- Apple at 1127B in Oct 2018, US GDP was 20 Trillions in 2018, math is easy : 5.635% of US GDP

3) Market cap as % of World's GDP: American dominance waned over the years, 

- IBM 1970 : 1,29% of Wolrd's GDP

- Microsoft 1999: 1,9% of World's GDP

- Apple 2018 : 1,127T and 80T world's GDP , math is easy: 1,41% of World's GDP

4) Market cap as % of Global Wealth, that's hard to compare as there are no data on Global Wealth in 1970, but comparing global wealth in 2000 and 2018 using Credit Suisse Wealth Report it's Microsoft which comes up on top

5) Apple is the winner in any event as liquidity cannot be compared with 1999 and 1970, people can so easily get in and out of their position with low fees and low barrier to entry (think stock trading from home etc)

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(90d)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column “Tx(90d)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

HOW I USE THIS: For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.

Ending the agreement with USPS allows them to open up new paths to growth but forces them to charge for their software; a major disadvantage in this business. Past growth figures when Stamps.com software was not free is around 10%/year compounded. If they can manage to book Amazon as a major customer, these growth figures could be higher.

The explanation that has been given for the stock tanking today is lower than expected margins guidance but that sounds like a lame excuse to me. Just seems like an irrational reaction, momentary short avalanche or some algo nonsense going on to me.

The numbers presented and the conference call made it clear that Dropbox business is growing strongly and they managed to increase their paying user base by 400,000 the previous quarter alone.

But I wonder if I'm missing something. I'm aware that DBX is up against strong competition, but they are finding ways to dynamize their business, like the recent acquisition of HelloSign, for example. I really don't see them losing ground any time soon. The service continues to be pretty popular.

I don't know any lingo.. volatility, how to ""become an expert"" in a specific stock, stock volume... basically everything lol.

&amp;#x200B;

anyways, i think i want to become a day trader. Im 23 years old, just graduated college and still living with my mom so its not like im rolling in cash at the moment. To me it seems like the people that actually make a profit from trading stocks are people that buy large volume of stocks, or people that invest in a company that'll ""break out"" soon.

&amp;#x200B;

so, first off day trading is simply buying and selling a stock in the same day? Therefore to see a profit you'd either have to 1) buy a large quantity of stock that fluctuates in price and gamble on that? or 2) technically this isn't day trading, maybe this would be considered ""holding"" but...purchasing a ""new"" stock in hopes for it to explode. for example, last year i bought like 8 shares of a marijuana stock company, its a growing business and the price rose, i sold once they rose. to me these are the only two ""forms"" of stocks there are to me.

&amp;#x200B;

 so again, id like to make instant profit but i dont understand how since stock prices adjust by the penny rather than dollar. i have little to no income about 300 a week, after bills i have like 50 bucks to invest and play with.

&amp;#x200B;

so heres a stock ""idea"" that i have. Nikes stock price sits around 80-90 bucks per share. after the Zion Williamson incident of him breaking out of his shoes i read that the nike stock took a hit. Therefore stocks are at an ""Average Low"". I say average low because its not like nike just went bankrupt but its low because the company ""took a hit"" in a way (this makes sense right?). BUT i know nike is a booming company. so it would be wise of me to purchase there stock right now because its low. so if i were to buy a share, and later today that share would probably fluctuate, i would sell it and make a small profit...all of this would be considered a wise day trading move correct?

&amp;#x200B;

sorry i dont have a straight question. I'm a weird learner. just trying to figure out if my mindset is in the right direction

Hey guys I discovered this company a few days ago and it looks like a steal on paper, but now I can’t help but feel I'm missing something. I bought my shares because when I subtracted the company’s liabilities (56M) from their Current assets (164M) there a difference of 108M (the liquidation value of the company). With a market cap of 31M this seemed like a steal to me. The company is barely profitable and FCF positive in addition their revenue is shrinking from customer loss. It seems to me the business is outdated but they have a lot of room to breathe while they change the business model and restructure the company. Also there is a New CEO and upper management as well.

**OPINION ABOUT TODAY**: Looks like the market is still feeling contracted, and not abundant in opportunities. Bare in mind that MPC state is ""ready_to_sell"" so it may not have a big jump tomorrow. MAR is in state ""ready_to_buy"" which is good, however, the success rate is at 0.75 so I wouldn't go all in in this position. As I said, the market is still cold. On a personal note, I am pretty happy that the system isn't making whacky suggestions! :)

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(90d)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column “Tx(90d)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

HOW I USE THIS: For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.

From a Free Cash Flow and Growth standpoint, I find QRVO to be a solid buy on dips. The current cash flows and growth produced by this company are undervalued. Q4 earnings are reported on 5/01/2019. Despite mobile market headwinds and lowered guidance, management still expects record cash flows in FY 2019. Current 2018 5g market opportunity for QRVO 600m, managements expected 2020 5g market opportunity 1B. Management is expecting limited cash flow growth in 2019 but much higher growth in 2020 and beyond.

My Strategy
I buy and hold stock until the company’s financials deteriorate, I find a better investment, or the company becomes overvalued according to my criteria. My longest holding period has been 2 years and running. If one of my holdings goes down, I look at it as an opportunity to buy more at a discount. My current holdings are BOX, ATIS, LOGM, MIK. Do your own research before buying into any of my recommendations.
