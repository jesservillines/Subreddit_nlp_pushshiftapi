What a tragic day it's been, after only trading for a few months. Let me start this by saying my emotions got the best of me, and it really hurt. I wasn't ready or expecting to take the loss I did, but I did learn a lot about myself in such a short period of time. Let's go over the trade today:

I am subscribed to warrior chatroom. He's been amazing at giving his mindset, and helping people like me emulate a winning mindset. So today he was watching BOXL, a running stock. In case you don't know, he calls everything out live in his room. I put typed in BOXL and saw it at 2.80. Then I hear him call out that he's gotten long in a position. Seeing how there were many stocks that ran in the past week, this seemed like another. SES and BIMI have both ran in the past few days, so I didn't want to miss the next big runner. As usual, I was slow to place my orders in. I ended up getting filled at 2.93, and added again at 3. Then a nightmare happened, it didn't break 3 and snapped back down. Now at this point, warrior said he was ready to bail. I was in my position full size, and stuck down 30 cents with a 2.97 average long. Then, next thing I know the stock doesn't bounce and warriors out of his position. Unfortunately, my emotions got the best of me, and I held on. It held 2.70 well, and I was thinking it was going to squeeze all the way to about 3.50 for a nice gain, but it didn't. It broke 2.70, and snapped all the way to 2.50, where I covered at 2.48 for a blow up loss. My emotions got the best of me and I was greedy when I should've taken it off at $3 when warrior said it was holding. Instead, I held and held, until it was over.

This experience has been extremely important as a learning and educational experience. I'm going to come back stronger, and not let my emotions get the best of me. Next month I'll be coming back in pursuit of becoming a top 5% trader, funding my account, and re-subscribe to get a better education.

The Blizzcon announcements were nothing special in my opinion, but the small earnings beat and COD mobile gave me a bullish outlook despite the 25 PE. Analysts sentiment seems to have a price target above my play's exit price($56 - $66).   


My biggest fears with the stock are in order:  


1. The last two months of upward movement could mostly be in anticipation of announcements at Blizzcon, which may not cut it for institutional investors.
2. Trump flips his tone on China again and announces restrictions on US game companies operating in China.
3. The last month of sideways movement breaks out, but downwards.
4. China cracks down on Hong Kong and punish Blizzard for walking back the Hearthstone debacle.

Disney reported Thursday an adjusted profit of $1.07 per share. That’s down 28% from $1.48 per share in the year-earlier period.

Still, Wall Street analysts glossed over the profit decline as Disney gets set to take on streaming giants such as Netflix at their own game.

So far, analysts like Disney’s chances in the streaming wars.

Does this mean that in order to claim a loss, I have to have a month gap before I bought the security and a month after I sell for a loss?

I saw a few posts and then I watched the nightly business report that had a summarized version of this investigation.  I will post the CNBC investigation below as the automod wont let me include in this post. 

It was created by the lady that ran pets.com  into the ground. Other than snake oil saleswoman I suspect her main job is to make numbers by any means necessary (aka turd polisher). Lockup I think is up at 12/24 meaning those holding will try to head through the door before this sh!thouse burns down. I dont have any hate for this entrepreneurial lady other than her whole mantra is that they verify every item sold and that is a lie. When you lie about your tagline you lie about anything.

Customers are not happy, luxury brands are not happy and moreover employees are not happy. Their main face of the brand for authentication bailed on them. Employees have lists of brands they skip authentication. Chanel is suing them for selling fakes. The employees authenticating are not qualified so this isnt just an ""oops, missed one"" moment.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I hire freelancers for my digital business through Upwork. What is great about them is there are no filings of 1099's or having to bookkeep records of my freelancers individually. Essentially, you hire Upwork Corp to use their freelancers for your business. With CA's law coming into effect, basically making it really hard for businesses to hire freelancers unless they fit strict guidelines, I feel like more people will use Upwork to get around CA's law.

I should also add when people talk about hiring/working freelance, its always in the same breath as ""Upwork"". That company keeps getting more and more popular.

The DA means that the Council has accepted Asterion's proposed design and operational parameters for the Project, a 75 ha (185 acre) intensive horticulture project that includes 40 ha (4.3 million square feet) of glasshouse modules for cannabis processing and cultivation, along with a world-class medicinal cannabis tissue culture propagation facility, research and quality assurance laboratories, and advanced security systems. 

""This is an exciting and important milestone for Asterion,"" stated Stephen Van Deventer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Asterion. ""This approval demonstrates that Asterion has responsibly designed the Project in line with the stringent requirements of the Council for a development of its significant size, befitting a project granted Major Project Status by the Australian Federal Cabinet. Unique to the Project are a number of important technical and operational innovations, which will enable Asterion to meet the expectations of a mature pharmaceutical marketplace while also supplying medicinal cannabis products to the rapidly growing Australian and global markets. The design characteristics of the Project are also optimised for environmental sustainability, including water saving and organic practices that reflect the environmental expectations of the Council and the broader Toowoomba community.

I've been watching some youtube videos to learn about dividend investing.

Specifically this guy uses a brokerage which has a neat automatic re-investing feature that let's you set your percentage breakdown goals by sector/industry and then specific company/stock within that sector/industry. Then it just takes the dividends you've earned and any transferred funds and automatically reinvests in a way that moves you towards your percentage breakdown goals. Another cool thing about M1 is that it allows you to purchase a fraction of a stock and get the fractional dividends.

Since my s.o. works for an asset management company (in the ""technology department"") I have to follow their rules of which brokerages to use. I am using Fidelity for both my IRA and taxable investment portfolio. I was using a newer brokerage before but now I've pulled it all out and I'm starting fresh in Fidelity. At least Fidelity has started commission free trades to compete with these newer brokerages.

My goal is to mimic the automatic reinvesting that M1 does.

I've found the settings page where I can control how dividends are used and there are 2 options:

1. automatically re-invest in the fund/stock where the dividend came from
2. put the dividends in the... I'll just call it the ""holding account"" that I transfer my external funds to to make trades.

Here are my questions:

* Are the automatically re-invested dividends purchasing fractional shares? Is it different if it's a fund vs a single security?
* To try mimicking M1's percentage breakdown goals automatic dividend re-investing feature in Fidelity, does it make more sense to let the dividends reinvest into the company they came from or does it make more sense to have to dividends go into the holding account? Just wondering if there is any ""loss"" between these two options.
* Is it possible to purchase a fractional share in Fidelity? Doesn't look like it online, but could I call them and have them do it for me?
* Is it possible to redirect my dividends to purchase a fractional share of another company's stock? If so does it have to be a stock that I already own?

The differences that I can think of are that I'd have to wait for the holding account to accrue to a certain value before I can purchase another full stock before purchasing one myself. So if Fidelity is automatically and immediately re-investing at fractional shares, then I think it would make more sense to let the dividends go back into the same company, where as if Fidelity is just holding the dividends until the next full stock amount to make another purchase, then it makes more sense to put them into the holding account.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,431597,public,self,How does dividend re-investing work in Fidelity?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dsin9g/how_does_dividend_reinvesting_work_in_fidelity/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,1573143937.0,,,,,,,

The short answer is yes. These reliable methods for day trading grant the following information to anyone as a day trader:

The price action (either weak or strong)

What the trend is (either bullish or bearish)

Who’s in control (either buyers or sellers)

&amp;#x200B;

But how do they see these patterns coming? What is it they're looking at to determine entry and exit points, aligning risk to reward? The simple answer is the charts. But not just any chart. Primarily candlestick charts and patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

Even as an easy-to-read graphic, candlestick charts contain a high amount of information. It is a representation of a trading period that anyone can use to analyze in detail. In the meantime, here’s a basic understanding on candlesticks.

&amp;#x200B;

What Are Candlestick Patterns? 

A candlestick pattern is a price trend that can be shown graphically to forecast a specific change in the market. Candlestick charts can provide a ton of information to anyone. The opening, closing, high and low prices for the specific time frame are shown by a candlestick.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the reasons many use patterns &amp; graphs of candlesticks is because patterns are easy to see. Chart patterns of the candlestick are almost like a blueprint. The structures don't always look exactly the same, but they look pretty similar enough that when anyone sees them over and over, they know that they're familiar — and that's when things can get really interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

How to effectively read Candlestick charts?

Just looking at these graphs of candlesticks will not produce positive results. To read Candlestick charts effectively, it is best to first understand [this charting method](https://kucoinblog.com/how-to-read-candlestick-charts-sk-rd) (Any person interested in analyzing trading markets would do well to be familiar with this process)

&amp;#x200B;

So, is it really a 100% reliable method for day trading?

&amp;#x200B;

It is said that anyone can only be right 60% of time in market. So what about remaining 40%? It all comes down to self management. They should be used alongside other forms of technical analysis to confirm the overall trend. It is not the holy grail of trading otherwise everybody would be rich by now. Sometimes markets do behave unexpectedly even best indicator with the right candlestick patterns can go wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that easy to find traction, like everything to do with day trading. It's time to get to work because everyone getting involved with trading needs to learn this set of skills. Put in time and effort, and it might be worth it.

If you have a successful track record, are somewhat obsessed with stock trading, understand how to play the probability game, and would like to work with another person to actively make money every week with a similarly motivated collaborator, please PM me. 

Over the past few months, I’ve moved a lot of my investments into cash out of fear that we’re going to experience a systemic price decline, whether caused by a recession or a market correction, within a year. My worry is that this might happen right after the next presidential election, but I have no idea. 

Normally, I make long-term investments. I’m increasingly reluctant to do that right now given my belief that we’re going to see a very substantial price decline. (Prices, especially in the tech sector, are greatly overvalued.) Because I know that I’ve been leaving money on the table, I’ve modified my long-term approach and focused on short-term trades (sometimes even day trades). I don’t like doing this, but it’s been working. In the past ten weeks, I’ve made over $20k. 

This has involved a lot of work, so I’m looking for an ambitious, financially astute collaborator. If you’re a tech geek, that would be a bonus, since we could do some things with Linux that might make it easier for us to make money.

The goal is to identify strong statistical bets each night, and—if the market is having a green day and other signs look promising—to roll the dice, with strong risk management in place (e.g. using stop-loss and trailing stop orders, where it makes sense). I’m looking for someone who is disciplined, reliable, has done this successfully for a while, understands how it works, and would enjoy fighting the market as a team rather than a group of one.

I usually trade $20k at a time—sometimes twice that as with BA when I got in at $328, and other times just one-third of that to manage risk with CEPU. If you have the mind of an engineer and the ambition of a trader, I’d love to hear from you.

If you’re The One, PM me. :)",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,431300,public,self,Seeking a Stock Picker,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dscts4/seeking_a_stock_picker/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,1573110916.0,,,,,,,

It’s very hard. You’re constantly competing against the sharpest, most intelligent human beings/computers in the world, who have deeper pockets, more information, and more experience than you do. You have to battle with yourself, go against the crowd, what’s so consciously innate to us, and battle the constant paradoxes that the market so often presents. There are many ways to make money in the market, but they’re hard to find. See? Paradox. You have to understand your opponents, have a proven game plan, and pick your battles wisely. Ready to play? Find a niche, dominate it, and become the house.

Most investors are driven by emotions that run the gamut from Extreme Pessimism to Jubilant Optimism. These Emotions can drive stock prices to the extremes of overvaluation and undervaluation. No matter how strong a man’s will power may be, he is influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by what he hears or sees, and his actions or executions are interfered with accordingly. The trick is not to be the hottest stock-picker, the winning forecaster, or the developer of the neatest model; such victories are transient. The trick is to Survive! Performing that trick requires a strong stomach for being wrong because we are all going to be wrong more often than we expect. The future is not ours to know. But it helps to know that Being Wrong is inevitable and normal, not some terrible tragedy, not some awful failing in reasoning, not even bad luck in most instances. The man who makes a success and keeps his money is the man who, after years of experience, has profited by his mistakes and schooled himself against his weak points.

I stumbled on warrior. Now spending an extra $200 a month was kind of ridiculous, seeing as I've only made a few trades since following tim.

I'm never quick enough to get my orders in. By the time I hear the call, I'm not able to fill the order fast enough. I usually use a market order, which allows a trader to get a quicker order.

Council planning officer Lachlan O'Sullivan approved Asterion Australia's development application for the project on Monday. 

According to documents filed with the council, the facility will consist of four glasshouse ""modules"", capable of producing 500 tonnes a year of dried cannabis for medicinal use, as well as processing, packing and tissue culture facility and administration building. 

The massive project is expected to take up more than 45ha and generate more than 1000 jobs, all while injecting up to $1 billion into the Toowoomba and Australian economies. 

The farm's product will be exported internationally via Wellcamp Airport. 

Asterion Australia director of communications and business development Dave Holland said the company was ""very pleased"" with the approval. 

""It's a major step forward for the project, that's for sure,"" he said. 

The company also applied to the Federal Government's Office of Drug Control for relevant approvals in December last year, and Mr Holland said he hoped a decision was imminent. 

He said the first, extensive civil works were expected to start in the first quarter of 2020. Asterion Australia has already begun the tender process and Mr Holland said they ""had people in mind"" to begin earthworks, ""but wouldn't be making commitments to anybody until we've got both the DA and the licence"". 

""We can say very confidently that there will be a lot of local participation involved,"" he said. 

""We'll be working to set up for businesses to engage with both the project, as in the development of it, but also the ongoing operation. We'll be working with Toowoomba and Surat Basin Enterprise to do that."" 

Mr Holland said the Toowoomba community had been ""extraordinarily supportive"" of the project. 

""We have just been astounded by how much support we've had from local businesses and the general public. We've got the feel in Toowoomba that this is the place they want to grow and do things and are acting on it. That's not always the case."" 

TRC Mayor Paul Antonio welcomed news of the project's approval. 

""It's going to be a world-leading enterprise and naturally we're quite happy about it,"" he said. 

""I think you'll find that shedded horticulture in this area has a very bright future."" 

Cr Antonio said the council had simply ""followed the rules and encouraged investment, and that will provide long-term, secure jobs for many people here"".

I am new to the stock market. I just got into it for about 2 months, despite that I have been very active for following financial news in the last several years (I am a student). My return has been positive since the beginning of my investment. It’s right now hovering around 4%. 

However, I keep thinking about the shares that I have sold that could have make more money if I am still holding on it today. My return would be like 8% if I haven’t sold those shares early.

It’s not that I haven’t been through a loss. I have! In the first a few weeks I started trading, my return is actually -3%, and I earned it back to a positive 4%.

How do you cope with this emotions? I know that I am being extra-picky here, since I have a positive return after all.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Facebook's 20119 Q3 results were strong, with revenues again growing leading to EPS growing 20%. ,the company reported adjusted earnings of $ 2.12 per share, up 20% from the prior year period and reversed two consecutive quarters of declining earnings.– is this situation will continue in the future ?

But on the other hand, we should not forget the regulatory concerns, both from the US government and from others countries -  we may be surprises that no one knows how they will be resolved, or in what way, and how it will  affect on the major tech companies that Facebook is one of them .

The US election year alone poses a risk to the markets - we saw what happened the previous time with the issue of ads and creation fake News - Will these new restrictions or laws ever be hurt by the profits of companies like Facebook?

The more interesting point is the appearance of the trading pattern
Diamond pattern is very large patterns, the technical implications are often extremely large. Technical targets price  are derived by subtracting the difference between the record high and the reaction low from the eventual breakout level. The breakout level will be determined by a trend line drawn from the reaction low to the first significant low on the right side of the pattern.
The diamond formation reversal pattern is usually does so at market tops rather than at bottoms.

I spend a lot of time reading books about the stock market, the history of it, trading options and a few in between. One thing I’ve taken a shot at lately is trading options on stocks from $2-$8. 

When I do options, I always buy calls. From the past two weeks, I’ve traded around 50’ish contracts and haven’t lost money on a single one. I always buy them at the beginning of the week, and pick the following week for them to expire. On average, I’d say I pay $150 for the contract(s) and I come out gaining $30-$120. 

Now that I’ve said some history, here’s my question; why don’t people just do that full time instead of just outright buying and selling stocks? If you can get $75 here and there, it adds up. I also know that my time is coming where I lose the full amount more than I gain. Point taken with $Fit. I have 5 contracts set to expire 11/15 at $7.36 and I’m currently -$120, so I know it’s not fool proof but that’s my only loss so far. For someone to throw more money than I do, buying 50+ contracts seems safer to only lose a portion of money as opposed to buying 5,000 shares out right. 

Am I at least going down the broad right path to making money or have I just gotten lucky?

CAMPBELL, Calif., Nov. 04, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KULR) (the “Company” or “KULR”), a leading developer of next-generation thermal management and battery safety technologies, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019.  


**Third Quarter 2019 and Subsequent Highlights:**

* KULR to Supply NASA with Lithium-Ion Battery Solution for International Space Station (ISS)  
Through a partnership with Leidos, a FORTUNE 500® science and technology company, KULR’s HYDRA Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS) storage solution which safely stores laptop lithium-ion batteries, is being procured by NASA for use on the ISS. KULR has provided a key component to the efficiency of the thermal management solutions being developed for NASA. KULR’s thermal management technology is expected to have applicability in future additional implementations, both on the ISS and other space destinations.
* Global Medical Equipment Manufacturer Incorporates KULR’s Internal Short Circuit (ISC) Device  
The Tier-1 medical equipment and device manufacturer is using KULR’s proprietary technology to improve battery pack design and safety solutions within various mission-critical medical product lines, enabling the use of new battery cells into current battery packs with increased energy capacity, while simultaneously maintaining high safety levels and backward compatibility within the same form factor. This application of KULR’s technology, which has previously primarily been used by NASA and other defense and research institutions, represents a commercial opportunity in the healthcare industry.
* Launched Safety-Driven Lithium-Ion Battery Design Solution Package for Commercial Markets  
This total solutions package transitions KULR’s advanced proprietary technologies into mass market commercialization across a diverse array of markets including electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and transportation logistics. KULR has worked with NASA Johnson Space Center, and industry leading customers in the automotive, medical equipment, and aerospace industries to design this total solution package which incorporates KULR’s HYDRA TRS and LYRA ISC Trigger Cell technologies.  

* U.S. Navy Selects KULR's Internal Short Circuit (ISC) Device for Use in Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV)  
The Navy Sea Systems Command has chosen KULR’s ISC technology as the safety and validation testing solution for the NAVY battery reserve program. The ISC device will be used whenever battery safety and storage designs are tested for UUVs. This marks a recent example of KULR’s long and successful history of working with government and industry experts to design and deploy the most comprehensive battery testing and safety platforms possible.

“Our core technology, proven out and vetted through partnerships with NASA and various Tier-1 aerospace operators, addresses vast unmet market opportunities in the electric mobility, battery safety and testing, consumer products, and aerospace industries. Advancing our position by moving into latter stages of product development for consumer facing applications has been a deeply satisfying experience for the KULR team as there are various difficulties with attempting to displace the way things have traditionally been done. We are a step closer to our goal of disrupting the world of electronics and battery storage by making products cooler, lighter, and safer,” said Michael Mo, Chief Executive Officer of KULR Technology Group.

“In the third quarter of 2019, we made important progress with certain Tier-1 product development partnerships by moving into later stages of work including beta testing. To date, we have experienced lumpiness in revenues, which is largely attributed to a lengthy product development cycle in which revenue earned can be inconsistent and dependent on stage of product development. We expect our recent work with commercial partners will lead to future growth into 2020 as we are well-positioned to convert our development partnerships into volume production customers. It’s been affirmed in multiple third-party tests that KULR’s cost-effective electronics and battery cooling products outperformed competitors’ solutions,” Mo concluded.

**Third Quarter 2019 Financial Summary**

* Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $526,722, compared to revenue of $482,798 in the same year-ago quarter. The revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in contract services provided during the 2019 period.
* Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2019, was $417,671, or 79% of revenues, compared to gross profit of $407,414, or 84% of revenues, for the same year-ago quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a slight reduction in sales of higher margin products as compared to the 2018 period.
* Total operating expenses, consisting of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, were $685,000 in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $623,000 in the same year-ago quarter.
* Net loss in the second quarter of 2019 totaled $268,000, or $(0.00) per share, compared to a net loss of $191,000, or $(0.00) per share, in the same year-ago quarter.
* Cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits were $76,000 as of September 30, 2019.

I'm from Malaysia.
Early this year I  invested in some stocks listened in Nasdaq through a broker company called Empire Investment (EIG) group based in Singapore.
A few months later I got an email from International Securities Regulatory Authority (Zurich world trade centre) saying that EIG had been suspended and that a company in Dublin were taking over the clients from EIG. They gave me the paperwork to go thorough that process. 

I was then contacted by the representative from the new company and they immediately wanted me to buy more stocks. There was one in which they said had great potential and were pushing it to me. I had interest but I did not want to go through with it because it was way out of my budget.
I then proceeded to tell them I would only be interested if I could come up with the money by asking business partners and friends if they would want to invest. So apparently according to the broker that was speaking to me. I gave them a confirmation of purchase which is bs. 

This all comes to my main problem. After being overseas for the past few months. I returned home to restart my business etc. I wanted to sell the stocks that I purchased as it's at a profit currently and I could use the money. So I call them and make my request. But they will not allow me to do so because they say that I have a pending purchase in my portfolio. 
I've proceed to check my mail and I see that they have sent me an invoice on the 1st of May this year. Which I did not see cause it was in my spam folder.

I just got of the phone earlier with the broker and explained to her that I did not make any confirmation and I even informed that that I had sent them an email on the 12th of May informing them that I am only interested in keeping my current shares and I could not raise money for the stocks that they wanted me to purchase.

In terms of UBER the taxi service. No one uses it! And that's just because we don't need it here in Japan.

Uber eats, Uber Freight, etc. Since a large number of countries in Asia are like Japan, I wouldn't be surprised to see more Uber eats launching in other cities. Not to mention Uber Freight which seems like a fantastic idea for truckers.  Are people putting too much thought into the ride sharing service and not considering UBER'S other avenues.

I am someone with a long investing future so I am looking to take on risk on a dividend growth company. I am looking for any ideas that people have of companies that pay a dividend but are high risk, high reward structured, such as TERP.  


I am not looking for companies paying a high yield (I don't want a risky dividend itself, but a company that has a high risk attached to it, which can be offset by a high earnings reward). So metrics i'm looking for are a reasonable payout ratio (No higher than 75-85%) and a high revenue growth.

Backstory: My mom’s dad claimed a long time ago that he had put stock away for all of the children (4 including my mom) in their names. He told her he invested in Ryder and that he put it away so that his wife (the children’s mom) could not touch it, fearing she would spend it. He died when I was very young.

In high school, maybe like 2 years before my grandma died, she had offered the money to my mom for a trip that I wanted to go on. She said the certificates were supposedly in a drawer. My mom declined.

Fast forward to now, which it’s been like 5(?) years since she died, we still have not located this money. I know it’s possible it doesn’t even exist, but I thought since we’ve hit roadblocks, maybe we’re just not thinking of something.

My grandpa lived in both Peru and LaSalle Illinois (my grandparents never divorced, but they didn’t really live together either – whole other story their). We’ve come to ends with both Ryder and Wells Fargo, since both of them stated that any stocks were converted to shares years ago. 

I’m mostly wanting to know if someone has a way to look up stocks, or if there’s a way to get names of every broker in those two cities? Or maybe there’s a huge secret database that would provide an account number? No one has found any certificates or even statements (if they had been converted to a share) and the people that live in Illinois (no offense to anyone from there) aren’t very helpful.

# **It’s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**
*****
&gt; As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it’s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.
*****
&gt; Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.
*****
&gt; # Top months ahead for stocks
&gt; November is the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&amp;P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.
*****
&gt; “Investors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They’re too skeptical that the market can advance,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.
*****
&gt; “I think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,” Stovall said.
*****
&gt; Of the more than 350 S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.
*****
&gt; “This will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they’re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That’s not good,” said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.
*****
&gt; “I think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we’re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.
*****
&gt; The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.
*****
&gt; “The rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&amp;P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today’s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “Today’s move lends some power to the bulls.”
*****
&gt; Redler said Apple’s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. “Traders love when Apple leads the way,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&amp;P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.
*****
&gt; Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.
*****
&gt; “The cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that’s been developing for weeks, it’s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,” said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.
*****
&gt; He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. “We think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,” he said.
*****
&gt; # What are bonds saying?
&gt; The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “We’re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm about it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. “The bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.”
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,” said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. “I think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.”
*****
&gt; However, Stovall said it’s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&amp;P 500, now about 2%.
*****
&gt; “I would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&amp;P has exceeded 22%,” he said.

# Typical November Trading: First Month of “Best Months”

&gt; November’s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&amp;P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA’s record matches S&amp;P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA’s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).

&gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November’s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19

&gt; It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.

&gt; The Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board’s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday’s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP’s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices—unlike Markit—are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**

&gt; The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday’s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today’s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM’s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week’s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan’s preliminary November data.

# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe

&gt; Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**

&gt; Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.

&gt; Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&amp;P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.

&gt; Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-6m.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**

&gt; Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.

# Guidance Trends Lower

&gt; Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that ""it's all about the guidance!"" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).

&gt; Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.

&gt; A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis. Want to see Bespoke's best analysis?

# The U.S. Economy Chugs Along

&gt; Gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed for a third quarter, but the U.S. economy is still chugging along at an average pace.

&gt; GDP grew 1.9% in the third quarter, its slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2018, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.

&gt; Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.

&gt; “The economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we’re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we’d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.”

&gt; Unfortunately, we don’t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.

(Bloomberg) -- Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s operating profit jumped 14% to a record as Warren Buffett’s conglomerate saw gains from its railroad and got some long-awaited earnings from Kraft Heinz Co.

Operating earnings climbed to $7.86 billion in the third quarter as investment income rose and Berkshire’s reinsurance group had the first underwriting profit in more than a year despite losses from a Japanese typhoon. Revenue climbed 2.4% on increases from the company’s insurers and manufacturing businesses.

The results pushed Buffett’s cash pile to a record $128 billion, even as he completed a $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum Corp., his chunkiest purchase in more than year.

The only good thing about the UK is it spits out some very smart people from Oxford and Cambridge, unfortunately most of them  usually go into politics, law or finance anyway. 


We don't produce any innovators anymore, any visionaries. The dominance we once had during the British Empire has long gone but a lot of people don't seem to realise we're not the powerhouse we used to be. We have a few nuclear submarines and somehow that entitles us to call ourselves a ""world power"". What a complete joke.

Anyway getting back to the question, is there any reason whatsoever to invest in the UK economy when the US economy is simply better? It's stronger, it's younger and with such a large population combined with incredible universities, produces some of the smartest minds in the world.


To me it seems like the UK economy (growth) has stagnated, like we're dragging our heels just coasting along, not losing value but not really making much either. For example we're only 5% higher than the 2008 high, why has it taken us 11 years to claw our way back when the U.S who get effected more (FTSE dropped 52%, S&amp;P dropped 57%) only took 4 years to recover?

I am going to start with the large caps before moving on to smaller companies and have tried to categorize them as much as possible for those who prefer to dip in and out. 

Starting with the big caps, **Alphabet** reported strong Q3 earnings on Tuesday before proceeding to buy Fitbit on Friday for $2.1 billion (70% above the pre-rumour price). The earnings report however got a more negative reception due to losses on equity holdings (probably Uber) impacting Alphabet’s net profitability by almost $3 billion. Excluding these items revenues were up 20% and core earnings up 17% resulting in an encouraging continuation of the strong growth reported in Q2. The stock closed on Friday with an attractive trailing PE of 27.33 (or 23.9 when adjusted for net cash of $144 million).

There was some good news for **Johnson &amp; Johnson** on Tuesday as they reported that independent testing had confirmed that there was no asbestos in the Baby Powder that had been recalled after the FDA reported that trace amounts had been found. It was good news for J&amp;J but the FDA was unconvinced and stood by its findings. 

**Beyond Meat** reported strong results after the bell on Monday with sales up 250%. However the stock price dropped sharply on Tuesday (20%) after a wave of selling followed the end of the lockup period as shareholders holding 80% of outstanding shares were allowed, for the first time, to sell and lock in some profits.

On Wednesday **Twitter** announced it would ban all political advertising in a move that will probably heap pressure on **Facebook** to do the same. Whilst a newsworthy story it is unlikely to have a big impact on either company with Facebook potentially losing out on 0.5% of revenues next year and Twitter even less. However it should have a more positive impact for local television and radio stations who will benefit as political advertisements switch to traditional media (if anyone knows a good local media stock please let me know).

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Purple Innovation, Universal Display and Teladoc)** 

On Thursday the mattress manufacturer Tempur Sealy jumped 11% after revenues increase 3% and earnings 15% but in my opinion it is Tempurs rival and mattress industry disruptor **Purple Innovation** that would make a much better investment.

Tempur's stock price has doubled this year and is valued at almost 2x revenues and 30x earnings which seems generous for a stock operating in a slow growing and cyclical industry.  However industry disrupter Purple Innovation is growing rapidly through direct online mattress sales and is priced on just 1x sales and 25x current year estimates (15x next years).

Purple is the second biggest “bed in a box” company, after Casper, and was founded by Utah based scientist entrepreneurs Tony and Terry Pearse after they developed and patented Hypo Elastic Polymer (HEP).  HEP is reportedly ""bouncy, responsive, and soft"" and more like a gel than foam (for those that need more explanation see link at bottom “myslumberyard”).

This benefit has not been missed by customers and Q2 revenues reported in August were up 36%, margins were up and guidance was raised significantly with revenue of $400 million to $425 million (from $350 million to $375 million) and EBITDA of $24 million to $27 million (from $3 million to $8 million) .

CEO Joe Megibow said ""I am confident that we are well positioned to profitably capitalize on the numerous growth opportunities we believe exist for the Company in the near and long-term.""

The internet combined with the ability to ship a quality mattress anywhere in the country inexpensively has disrupted the whole mattress industry. Purple Innovation has grown quickly and executed well since it was listed in February 2018 but this has not been reflected in the stock price.

The company is expected to report profitability for the first time this year. This should be a good catalyst to drive the stock to a higher multiple. Economies of scale and the opportunity to win share in a huge market offer great potential.

**Universal Display**’s stock price jumped 15% after strong results on Wednesday. The stock already had an eye wateringly high valuation but the opportunity for growth from OLED televisions is truly remarkable and, in my opinion, the optimism is justified.

Universal Display owns more than 5,000 organic light emitting diode (OLED) patents that generate royalties from OLED manufacturers based on smart phone screen area manufactured. That screen area is increasing rapidly. The smart phone sector still has some growth left in it but the real opportunity is OLED televisions (with each 60 inch tv equating to almost 100 smart phones) which are expected to drive 150% growth over the next four years.

Now assuming Universal Display's revenues increase by 150% and its net margin increases from 33% (yes 33% is correct) to 40%, then earnings of $400 million on a PE of 24 would just about pretty much justify the current valuation. That doesn’t offer much of a cushion for investors wanting to buy in unless there are significant opportunities for growth beyond five years.

Well there are significant opportunities.  OLEDs are the most efficient way to turn electricity into light. They are flexible and can be produced in any shape and are capable of producing a softer more pleasant ambient lighting. Televisions have a long run way of growth ahead of them but lighting has not even gotten started. According to a report last year from ResearchAndMarkets, sales of OLED lighting products are set to grow at 50% p.a. to $1.4 billion by 2022. And even that's only scratching the surface. Sales are expected to increase a further fourfold by 2027.

For me Universal Display's valuation is eye watering. It is a growth stock priced for perfection and will fall sharply with any set back. However the opportunity is huge and, with Universal Display owning the intellectual property, so is the potential upside.

**Teladoc’s** stock increased 14% after reporting 24% revenue growth on Wednesday but the company faces many competitors and Amazon has already dipped its toe into remote medical services.

Teledoc uses telephone and videoconferencing technology to provide on-demand remote medical services. This is a large industry (estimated at $20bn) and growing quickly (estimated at 17% p.a.). Teladoc, with a market cap $5.5bn, is currently the best known and largest player in the sector. 

However, in my opinion, growth of 24% is not sufficient to support a valuation of 10x revenues unless the company has a significant competitive moat and clear runway to market dominance. Teladoc does not have that. There are plenty of competitors (even if none of them are listed) who are willing to offer cheaper pricing in order to chip away at Teladoc’s market share.  More worrying is that Teladoc’s 70% gross profit margins have caught the eye of Amazon who announced the launch of Amazon Care in September. That scheme is initially being tested on a small number of Amazon employees but it is almost certain to grow and become a competitor for Teladoc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks (Royal Carribean and Hanesbrands)**

**Royal Caribbean** dropped on Wednesday after reporting its best Q3 ever. The company missed expectations by a few cents but still managed to increase earnings by 9% compared to last year. A remarkable achievement given Hurricane Dorian “the most disruptive storm in the company’s history” knocked 13 cents off the total.  The company issued 2019 guidance with EPS of $9.50-9.55 meaning the stock ($111.15 at Friday’s close) is only trading on 11.7x current year guidance. Additionally, in an encouraging article reported by Barron’s, Royal Caribbean’s CEO said that he expects a ""very robust 2020""

**Hanesbrands** also dropped after reporting good results but managed to recover most of those losses by Friday. Constant currency sales were up 2%, earnings increased 4% and full year guidance for sales and earnings were increased to show similar growth.  Sales at Hanesbrands’ increasingly popular retro brand Champion increased by 25% which was less than 50% last quarter but still very encouraging. 

However, even after the stocks recovery, the trailing PE for Hanesbrands was just 9.68 at Fridays close. In my opinion the market is missing the bigger picture. Hanesbrands is a stable company with its Champion brand enjoying a retro revival. According to a Bloomberg report in April, teenage boys rank Champion among their 15 favorite brands alongside designers Gucci and Tommy Hilfiger. Such a brand surely is worthy of a much better multiple -- perhaps even 15x.

&amp;#x200B;

**Great company but too pricey (Moody’s)**

**Moody’s Corporation** reported a beat and raise on Wednesday with revenues up 15%, earnings up 27% and FY 2019 guidance increased from adjusted EPS $8.05 to $8.125 at the midpoint ($7.39 last year).

Moody's is an attractive business. The largest player by a margin in the duopoly/oligopoly that is the credit rating business. Regulatory requirements are increasing, long term bond issuance is increasing (even if short term down turns continue) and investors demand either a Moody's or S&amp;P rating (preferably Moody's).  That makes it nearly impossible for new entrants.

During the Great Recession (which caused no shortage of criticism of the rating agencies) revenues only fell briefly in 2007 before beginning their relentless march upwards again.

However, a lot of this good news is now priced in. The stock is up 70% from year lows and, valued at 27.1x current year estimates, it is no longer the bargain it was.

In short I think Moody’s is a great company and a long term hold. But I'm going to wait for the next market wobble. I don't think that wobble will be anything as bad as 2007 but, nevertheless, I think I'll be able to pick up Moody’s stock a lot cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

**Speculative and high risk (Sprint and Tupperware Brands)**

**Sprint Corporation,** the communications company, announced last week that it will report earnings on November 4th. However for most investors the results are irrelevant and it is the prospect of a merger with T-Mobile that will ultimately decide the value of Sprint’s stock. 

There are a number of commentators (such as Boost Mobile founder Peter Adderton) saying that Sprint Corporation is going to zero if the planned merger with T-Mobile doesn’t get approved.  On the other hand, with Justice Department approval, significant progress has been made and the primary issue remaining is the multi-state anti-trust lawsuit planned to start on December 9th.  Furthermore, former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell seems to believe strongly that this attempt to block the deal will fail (see Bloomberg link at bottom of post).

So what are the potential payoffs?  Under the current offer you need 9.75 Sprint stocks to get 1 T-Mobile stock if the merger is approved.  At yesterday’s close you would need $61.43 worth of Sprint stock to swap for $82.47 of T-Mobile stock. That represents a potential upside of 34.3%. However, if the deal fails we are assuming, like Mr Adderton, that you get zero.  On that basis, the implied probability of success of the merger is 43%.

Those who believe that the odds of success are higher, like Mr McDowell seems to, may wish to buy in. But they should understand that they could lose the entire stake if the deal falls through.

**Tupperware Brands** fell sharply on Wednesday after reporting a bad miss. Revenues fell 14% and EPS of $0.43 missed expectations by a whopping 19 cents. But with the stock down 40% this week to $9.71 (and down 85% from 2017 highs) it looks like it may now offer a (risky) opportunity.

Tupperware’s balance sheet looks fine and the lowered guidance of $1.95 (adjusted $2.80) would still be a good result for the company if it manages to deliver.  Even if we assume a worse deterioration with earnings halved to $1.60 the stock still looks reasonably priced.

The problem is challenging headwinds from economic and political concerns to declining relevance. The steps that management have taken to turn the company around don't seem to have worked. Worryingly there has been almost no indication of improvement.

However that is usually the best time to get in to a speculative opportunity.  The potential upside here is that a positive quarter or two could see the stock rise 200% approaching $30 if not higher. The downside is the stock could fall to zero. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Disaster of the week (Grubhub)**

Grubhub dropped 43% on Tuesday after guidance for flat revenues proved that any idea that the company possessed powerful double-sided network effects with restaurants and diners was incorrect.  It is a bleak assessment for the industry as a whole but hit Grubhub particularly hard given its high expectations.  In short, network effects appear to be only local and that’s why competitors like DoorDash, Uber Eats, Caviar, and Postmates have been able to carve out market share. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.

&gt; African swine fever set to claim a quarter of world’s pig population

&gt; Global pork prices are rising spurred by growing demand from China, where as many as 100 million pigs have died since the disease broke out there last year.

&gt; The virus has now been identified in 50 countries, including Poland, Russia, South Korea
and the Philippines. So far, the furthest west the disease has been found is in Belgium, among the wild boar population. A cull is now planned in the country.

&gt; “There have been suggestions recently from the Chinese government and industry representatives that the Chinese pig herd is ‘bottoming out’ and that we could see a recovery to something like previous levels in 2020.

&gt; “However, most global analysts believe this is very optimistic and that, given the enormous losses so far and the continued spread of the virus across China and other Asian countries, there will be a huge deficit in pork production for the foreseeable future.

&gt; “Pork prices in China are at record levels and there are already signs that consumers are switching to other proteins. The Asian [African swine fever] crisis is having an enormous impact on the global pork industry, with record export volumes pushing prices up around the world.”

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I’m thinking of taking out a loan to invest. 

If the loans have low APR (like 5% or less) of  interest and allows me to keep the money for at least a year while I invest it, then I will take the loan.

I would invest it in low volatility ETFs such as SPLV and if I wanna track the S&amp;P 500 I will go with VOO or SPDR.

Now I’m not just gonna take out the loan whenever or wherever. 

I’m gonna take it out during or just after a bear market to hopefully participate in the gains as the bear market recover and start to stabilize. 

If I lose money I would expect to lose 10% in a correction, 20% or more in a bear market. So 30% of my own cash plus the interest of the loan is for insurance so I don’t default. But since it’s right after or during a bear market chances are low I would lose an significant amount. 

Does anyone think this is an good strategy or is it just straight up retarded. 

Tell me why and perhaps something I don’t know about.

The question is...does the current stock price make it an attractive acquisition target?  

Reasons BlackBerry (BB) may be attractive for acquisition:       

•  BlackBerry has had a presence in the automotive market for a while now, supplying its QNX operating system for automotive 
    infotainment systems and connected cars.

•  The installed base for QNX has risen from 60 million units in 2016 to over 150 million in 2019.

•  The company is expanding into higher-value areas such as driver assistance systems, instrument clusters, and domain 
    controllers, while also testing self-driving software.

•  An increasing mix of its design wins for QNX are coming from the Non-infotainment market.

•  In Q2’19, all 8 automotive design wins were non-infotainment, compared to 5 infotainment and 4 non-infotainment in Q3’19.

•  The revenue base of the Technology Solutions business – which derives much of its revenues from these automotive bets – has 
    grown from $134 million to $204 million last fiscal year.

•  The Market For Vehicle Software Is Expanding Fast: Overall software content per vehicle is expected to grow from $1200 in 
    2018 to over $5000 by 2030, per McKinsey, and this is a trend that could benefit BlackBerry.

I honestly like this comparison a lot, if only since it gives a good foundation for honest discussion about the company itself, rather than the short-term behavior of the stock.

Similarities:

* Stock has/had more hype than any other public company and is extremely volatile
* Product appeals to those looking to reduce carbon footprint
* Game plan is to make this product desirable for other reasons
* Long term goal is to match/beat price point of market standard product.
* Big name competitors pose competitive risk, have much larger RnD budgets (Much of which, however, is already allocated towards portions of their business which don’t directly compete)
* Early sales were sky high despite price point.

———————————————————

**The biggest difference:** Sports cars, being a luxury item, and cars in general have a much smaller consumer population than people who eat burgers. This isn’t relevant to sales, but you’re going to have a much wider survey of people comparing the product to the non-eco friendly alternative.

Compared Advantages:

**Tesla Advantages:**

* Tesla didn’t have a comparable company like Impossible competing with it.
* I think it’s easier to make a sports car desirable than it is a synthetic meat compound.
* One could maybe argue that Elon is a better project manager given his engineering background.

**Beyond Advantages:**

* Beyond’s sales benefit from being able to sell product through well established brands who manage much of the consumer-side expense (marketing, vending labor, geographic penetration). Tesla specifically avoided this by not selling through dealerships.  

   * Note: *This can also make the product less “shiny” in the eyes of the consumer, which increases the risk that other brands will be able to grab the attention of consumers while also decreasing consumer perception should consumers fail to differentiate between the two products (one being better in quality).*",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,428151,public,self,Comparing Beyond Meat &amp; Tesla,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dptfh3/comparing_beyond_meat_tesla/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,1572640220.0,,,,,,,

&gt; ***Hi r/stocks! I am just putting out next week's most anticipated earnings calendar a day earlier than usual due to not being able to get around to do this tomorrow or this weekend. I really don't like to post these up any earlier than Friday's because sometimes the calendars can look a bit wonky where you might see some companies on the calendar that are actually not scheduled to report, or are reporting on another day, etc etc. but unfortunately I don't really have much of an option here...it's either putting this up now or no earnings thread at all for next week. Anyway, please do me this favor everyone and review carefully the companies that are scheduled to report on their respective days for next week. Admittedly, I did not get a chance to confirm all the companies that are on this week's calendar are actually reporting, but if you see something that doesn't look right, as far as a company that is listed up on this calendar on a particular day that isn't expected to report, please just post a little notice in this thread so that everyone is made aware of it! I'd greatly appreciate that. It's very possible that there are some company logos on this calendar that are misplaced here. FWIW, I do not create these calendars. These are coming straight from EW (Earnings Whispers). Thank you!***

KNX has been lying low for quite sometime now, thanks to persistent softness in freight demand. Consequently, revenues at the trucking segment (major source of revenues) are being hampered. Amid this weak freight scenario, an increased supply of trucks is putting downward pressure on pricing.
 
Stiff competition in the intermodal space is further weighing on the company’s performance. Additionally, high capital expenditures are hurting its bottom line.

Knight-Swift’s recently released (on Oct 23) third-quarter earnings report bears evidence to this dismal picture. The company’s third-quarter earnings (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 48 cents were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the bottom line decreased 26.2% year over year. Total revenues of $1,200.5 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,225.7 million and also declined 10.8% year over year.

This weak show is well reflected in the company’s price performance in the past seven days. Over this period, Knight-Swift has gained 2.8%, underperforming its industry’s 3.1% rise.


Earnings Report in Detail

Third-quarter results were affected primarily by low revenues at the trucking and intermodal segment. Notably, increased competition in the intermodal space induced 10.3% and 6.8% reduction in volumes and revenue per load, respectively.

Effective tax rate in the third quarter was unchanged year over year at 24.6%. For the full year, the same (before discrete items) is still expected in the 25-26% range.

From the first quarter of 2019 onward, the company started reporting under three segments, namely Trucking, Logistics and Intermodal following the realignment of its segments.

Segmental Results

Revenues in the Trucking segment totaled (excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions) $876.38 million, down 6.4% year over year. Results were hampered by 6.4% decrease in average revenue per tractor (miles per tractor declined 4.1%). Adjusted segmental operating income fell 22.1% to $109.76 million. Adjusted operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) also deteriorated to 87.5% in the third quarter from 84.9% a year ago. Notably, lower value of this key metric bodes well for the company.

Revenues in the Logistics segment (before intersegment transactions) amounted to $83.63 million, declining 24.9% year over year due to 25% fall in brokerage revenues. While adjusted operating ratio deteriorated 470 basis points (bps) to 95.6%, segmental operating income plunged 63.6%.

Revenues in the Intermodal segment (excluding intersegment transactions) totaled $108.76 million, down 16.4% year over year as a result of 10.3% fall in load counts. Segmental adjusted operating ratio of 102.4% deteriorated 980 bps while operating loss came in at $2,652 million against operating income of $9,688 million reported a year ago.

Operating Results

Total operating expenses decreased 8.7% year over year to $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated to 89.6% from 87.1% reported in the year ago quarter. Knight-Swift’s adjusted operating income declined 27.4% year over year to $113.71 million due to weaker segmental revenues.

Liquidity

The company exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $94 million compared with $82.49 million at the end of 2018. Long-term debt (less current portion) amounted to $364.77 million compared with $364.59 million in December 2018. During the first nine months of 2019, Knight-Swift repurchased shares worth $86.9 million and returned $31.2 million to shareholders through dividend payments.

Outlook

The company expects seasonal improvement in demand during the ongoing quarter albeit lower than previously anticipated. In 2020, it hopes to see a better freight environment.

Negative Estimate Revisions

The pessimism surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings being revised 5% downward in the past 60 days.

Given this bleak backdrop, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is well justified and hence we believe investors should discard this stock from their portfolios at the moment.

Facebook reached 2.45 billion monthly users, up 1.65%, from 2.41 billion in Q2 2019 when it grew 1.6%, and it now has 1.62 billion daily active users, up 2% from 1.587 billion last quarter when it grew 1.6%. Facebook scored $17.652 billion of revenue, up 29% year-over-year, with $2.12 in earnings per share.

Facebook’s earnings beat expectations compared to Refinitiv’s consensus estimates of $17.37 billion in revenue and $1.91 earnings per share. Facebook’s quarter was mixed compared to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of $2.28 EPS. Facebook earned $6 billion in profit after only racking up $2.6 billion last quarter due to its SEC settlement.

Facebook shares rose 5.18% in after-hours trading, to $198.01 after earnings were announced, following a day where it closed down 0.56% at $188.25.

Notably, Facebook gained 2 million users in each of its core U.S. &amp; Canada and Europe markets that drive its business, after quarters of shrinkage, no growth or weak growth there in the past two years. Average revenue per user grew healthily across all markets, boding well for Facebook’s ability to monetize the developing world where the bulk of user growth currently comes from.

Facebook says 2.2 billion users access Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger every day, and 2.8 billion use one of this family of apps each month. That’s up from 2.1 billion and 2.7 billion last quarter. Facebook has managed to stay sticky even as it faces increased competition from a revived Snapchat, and more recently TikTok. However, those rivals might more heavily weigh on Instagram, for which Facebook doesn’t routinely disclose user stats.

Facebook expects revenue deceleration to be pronounced in Q4. But CFO David Wehner provided some hope, saying “we would expect our revenue growth deceleration in 2020 versus the Q4 rate to be much less pronounced.” That led Facebook’s share price to spike from around $191 to around $198.

However, Facebook will maintain its aggressive hiring to moderate content. While the company has touted how artificial intelligence would increasingly help, Zuckerberg said that hiring would continue because “There’s just so much content. We do need a lot of people.”

Regarding Libra’s regulatory pushback, Zuckerberg explained that Facebook was already diversified in commerce if that doesn’t work out, citing WhatsApp Payments, Facebook Marketplace and Instagram shopping.

On anti-trust concerns, Zuckerberg reminded analysts that Instagram’s success wasn’t assured when Facebook acquired it, and it has survived a lot of competition thanks to Facebook’s contributions. In a new talking point we’re likely to hear more of, Zuckerberg noted that other competitors had used their success in one vertical to push others, saying “Apple and Google built cameras and private photo sharing and photo management directly into their operating systems.”

Overall, it was another rough quarter for Facebook’s public perception as it dealt with outages and struggled to get buy-in from regulators for its Libra cryptocurrency project. Former co-founder Chris Hughes (who I’ll be leading a talk with at SXSW) campaigned for the social network to be broken up — a position echoed by Elizabeth Warren and other presidential candidates.

The company did spin up some new revenue sources, including taking a 30% cut of fan patronage subscriptions to content creators. It’s also trying to sell video subscriptions for publishers, and it upped the price of its Workplace collaboration suite. But gains were likely offset as the company continued to rapidly hire to address abusive content on its platform, which saw headcount grow 28% year-over-year, to 43,000. There are still problems with how it treats content moderators, and Facebook has had to repeatedly remove coordinated misinformation campaigns from abroad. Appearing concerned about its waning brand, Facebook moved to add “from Facebook” to the names of Instagram and WhatsApp.

It escaped with just a $5 billion fine as part of its FTC settlement that some consider a slap on the wrist, especially since it won’t have to significantly alter its business model. But the company will have to continue to invest and divert product resources to meet its new privacy, security and transparency requirements. These could slow its response to a growing threat: Chinese tech giant ByteDance’s TikTok.

Some investors want Apple to sell its iPhone on a subscription basis to shift more of Apple’s revenue from transactional sales to recurring revenue.

Apple CEO Tim Cook didn’t shoot down the idea during a conference call on Wednesday and suggested that Apple is working on new ways to pay for iPhones on a monthly basis.

I mean who really needs a personal action cam, right? How much sky diving are you really doing... But who really needs health monitoring? Come on, it's your health, everyone could probably benefit in some way. It seemed like they were investing a lot in R&amp;D too, I thought it had a lot more potential than a fad device.

I bought some shares in the teens, I averaged down, it kept falling, I cut some losses. None of this was a major investment, just some rainy day funds. I considered adding more when it feel into the $3 range, but went for some more TSLA instead.

Look at a 5yr chart of them, it's not good... actually almost identical to GoPro. What happened is their market share dropped, it wasn't the days of them being the only wearable in town, and seemed inevitable that smart watches from the major players like Apple would kill them in that market in the long-run. Revenue popped from $745M in 2014 to $1.8B 2015, 2.1B 2016, but then down to $1.6 in 2017, down to $1.5 in 2018, estimates in $1.4 this year. Not profitable in that 2017-2018 stretch, only borderline now. But, they kept up the R&amp;D (1,694 employees in 2018, 56% in R&amp;D! [https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Fitbit-Reports-571-Million-Q418-Revenue-and-151-Billion-FY18-Revenue/](https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Fitbit-Reports-571-Million-Q418-Revenue-and-151-Billion-FY18-Revenue/) ). They've been increasing R&amp;D spending steadily every year, and continue to file and gain patents. Hell they even added an SPO2 sensor to devices being sold, for what seems like pure development purposes ( [https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Charge-3/SPO2-Sensor-is-on-where-is-the-data/td-p/3685429](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Charge-3/SPO2-Sensor-is-on-where-is-the-data/td-p/3685429) / [https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-sleep-apnea-trials-complete-7541](https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-sleep-apnea-trials-complete-7541) ).

They also have half a billion cash and no debt.

Their recent play has been monetizing healthcare, and that's back to my longterm outlook for them as everyone could benefit, but I admit it has shifted my image of their products from a trendy device to something that might be issued to my grandma by her insurance company. My fitbit that when brand new to me was a cool tech accessory, was suddenly not cool. Seeing the ""Fitbit"" logo on the face of it wasn't cool. I even stopped wearing it and considered getting an Apple watch. I was happy to see their Versa 2 ditched the logo. But still, they're probably not gonna outdo Apple in the smart-watch segment in the long run. This tech will only become increasingly easier to integrate into a single item and people won't have the need to have a ""fitness tracker"" and a smart watch - for these reasons, accepting a buy out deal makes sense. Now note, even as a more niche brand with a healthcare focus, I don't think they are another GoPro, yet their stock has still been priced like it.

So now to get to the point - the rumored/confirmed buyout from Google / Alphabet. Two questions I see are what is a fair price, and will Fitbit accept it. Now keep in mind, Google paid $3.2B for Nest, and Nest has struggled [https://www.vox.com/2018/4/23/17272756/google-alphabet-nest-q1-earnings-2018-revenue-operating-loss](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/23/17272756/google-alphabet-nest-q1-earnings-2018-revenue-operating-loss)). Nest generates much less revenue, they don't have nearly as broad of a potential market, I'm not sure what their IP is worth or the information coming in from homes, but it just doesn't seem out of line to me at all that Fitbit, with their IP and market share, might not be worth at least as much as Nest was to acquire. And Nest, btw, was Google's 2nd largest acquisition, behind Motorola ($12B). I could easily see Fitbit becoming the new 2nd place. Google wants to and is poised to expand in this market ( [https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-watch](https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-watch) ). **Now I don't know if they would do the Nest deal again in hindsight, but I think that FIT is at least as valuable to them as whatever they got out of that deal, probably much more.**

So now to the numbers: a $3.2B buyout of FIT works out to over $12/share. $2B is $7.73. $1.5B, about their (FIT) revenue this year, is $5.8, which is where it closed today. That's gotta be a no brainer for Google, I have to imagine the only question is whether Fitbit would sell (some think James Park will not, but come on Park, you gotta do it). But my thesis here is that **a deal over $10 makes the most sense AND is still a huge win-win for both Fitbit and Google**. That's up over 70% from current share price. I don't know if the first offer put on the table is gonna be accepted, but I think there is a good chance they will reach something due to the win-win nature of this. This won't be another Nest and can be had for much cheaper. If there's a bidding war involving Apple or Amazon as others have speculated, all the better... 

So, I've bought back in to increase my small stake by 75%, I'm thinking of fully doubling or more.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,427762,public,self,FIT - my new bet on Fitbit (including Google acquisition),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dpdx6l/fit_my_new_bet_on_fitbit_including_google/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,1572560419.0,,,,,,,

Broker can use shares in different ways and if it goes bad you may end up with entitlement to nothing (more details at the end).

So, I'm thinking about addressing that risk. In USA there are two ways **DRS** and **Physical Certificate**. Physical Certificate is way too complicated, so I'm looking at DRS. But I can't find any information how to actually do that. I get some references to the **Computershare** company. I'm I supposed to open an account there and transfer the shares from my broker to Computershare? Is there a good detailed instruction online how to do that?

And what about the **Europe** shares. Is there a way to hold it directly similarly to DRS in US?

Do you know a good resource on the topic? Not the details about laws but the **practical guide** how to register shares under your own name.

P.S.

When you buy shares via broker, you don't own it, what you own is entitlement to shares owned by broker. Broker owns your shares (see registered in street name). Broker can use shares in different ways and if it goes bust you may end up with entitlement to nothing. Or, it can use it as a collateral (hypothecation) and the creditor claim on shares has priority over your entitlement and again you end up entitled to nothing. It's even worse as there could be chains of ownership and collateral chains and if any participant in those chains goes bust it may end up badly. The SIPC insurance won't help as they have only around 1b$ in reserves, so they can help only in very small cases.

My Name is Sato, from Japan.

I’m in despair now.

A year ago, I was scammed by my friend and had more than 50,000$(5 million in Japanese yen) of debt.

I’m so disappointed, but I’m responsible for this, so I have been reimbursing it every month.

Bad things tend to happen one after another.

The huge typhoon hit Japan the other day, and a lot of houses in a part of Japan were flooded, including my house.

I thought “why must I only have such a terrible experience?”.

Even before the typhoon I had little money, I can’t afford to making a living.

I tried to commit suicide, but I couldn’t.

I’m introducing myself. I’m 32 years old. I got my master’s degree, and work in company now.

I used to not being wealthy very much, but I felt every day’s life happy.

However, the debt completely changed my life.

I have two dreams.

One is taking my grandmother, 95 years old, to a short trip. She was born in 1924, before the World War II. She may not be alive up to 100 years old, so I ‘d like her to give back when she is fine.

The other is… I want to live quietly. I was tired. Not necessary a rich life, but an ordinary life.

I broke up with my girlfriend few months ago, by beginning to talk from me. I didn’t say about the debt, but didn’t want to make her unhappy.

Finally, could anyone donate me some money? I don’t have parents now, so I don’t have any person to rely on in Japan. I thought situation never changes unless I take an action. The world is vast, so I decided to write such a request on Internet. A little money is so glad for me.

If you could do or listening to my situation, please contact me.

[liveforhappiness725@gmail.com](mailto:liveforhappiness725@gmail.com)

I made a paypal address and bitcoin address in order to receive money.

My bitcoin address is:

3PjjDLN1TGP5Vfhga7bLnMDioknxhH9DgM

If I could be given some donation, I will do everything if I can, as a gratitude.

Regardless whether there is any help or not, I want to guide visitors at the next year’s Tokyo Olympics as a volunteer, as my humble thanks. This is third “small” dream.

The U.S. toymaker’s shares rose nearly 20% in extended trading.

Worldwide Barbie gross sales rose 10% to $412.8 million in the third quarter, while analysts had expected a 1.2% drop on fears that demand would ease in the run-up to the release of the Disney princess movie “Frozen 2”, the doll rights to which are owned by Hasbro Inc ([HAS.O](https://www.reuters.com/companies/HAS.O)).

Mattel’s international gross sales rose 10% to $721.7 million, lifted by sales of dolls based on Korean boy band BTS, which has dominated international music charts.

Mattel bagged the rights for dolls based on the seven-member band earlier this year.

BTS and Barbie, which has been modernized with variants of based on popular celebrities, role models, different skin tones and professions, helped lift worldwide doll sales by 5%.

Adjusting for this, profit before tax increased 16.7%.

Analysts seem comfortable with this.  The stock is down 2% but up 20% over the last 6 months.

That contrasts with Q1 when the stock dropped 20% in April after a sharp drop in ad revenue that spooked the market.  

Alphabet bounced back in July as the Q2 report showed that it was business as usual with revenues and earnings both rising about 20%.  Core advertising business revenues were again growing strongly (16%) and there was an even better performance in the cloud business.

Q3 results this afternoon again show that investors have little to worry about.  That has allowed the stock price to return at last to where it was in April.  

So what did happen back in Q1?

I think CNBC provided a helpful insight in a couple of articles they published around the time (sorry I dont think multiple links are allowed on Reddit so I have provided the titles at the bottom).

These reported that changes had been made to the YouTube algorithm to curb the spread of fake news, conspiracy theories and harmful content and that this caused lower engagement and ad revenue growth on the site.

For me this is a significant positive. The company has addressed the industry’s most pressing issues, even though this impacted short term growth, and revenues and earnings are again growing at a healthy clip.  

Currently the trailing PE 26.9 compares favorably to growth.  If you adjust the PE for net cash (net cash $144 billion and adjusted PE 22.6) its valuation looks even cheaper.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.

So I clarified with her. I typed in Google's stock and showed her the chart. Then I told her, ""You're telling me that you can buy this stock at this very second for 10% off the current amount (what was on the screen)

She proceeded to tell me that she could.

I then clarified with her further.

She told me it's not a limit, nor a bid or an ask. And it's not options. So no shorts or calls.

When I asked for elaboration and played dumb, ie. ""Hey, I don't know much about investing and never heard about this. Can you teach me?"" -- She later mentioned it would take her about an hour for her to teach this to me, etc.

(the “Company” or “PreveCeutical”)** (CSE: PREV, OTCQB: PRVCF, FSE: 18H), is pleased to announce the successful completion of the design, synthesis and preliminary evaluation of key peptides from its scorpion venom-derived peptide research and development program (the “**Peptide Program**”). The Peptide Program is expected to enable the Company to develop their own proprietary, Nature IdenticalTM, peptide therapeutics, which are intended for therapeutic applications. PreveCeutical’s initial therapeutic focus was to understand the activities of such peptides in cell-based brain cancer models.

In the first stages of the Peptide Program, PreveCeutical’s research partner successfully identified four peptides that individually inhibit the activity of a target protein (the “**Target Protein**”) implicit in the progression of certain brain cancers (see news release dated March 11, 2019).

In the final stage of the Peptide Program, the four peptides were further tested in a number of *in vitro* studies in certain brain cancer cell lines and also in a patient-derived neural oncosphere cell line of a brain cancer. Screening of the four peptides in an invasion assay model showed that they had ability to reduce the invasion potential in brain cancer cell types (see news release dated April 10, 2019). The Company believes that this is an important development given that “invasion” is a key driver of the aggressiveness, rapid spread and poor prognosis commonly associated with certain brain cancers.

From these studies, two peptides showed the most potential for further development as therapeutic agents in the management of certain brain cancers. These two lead peptides were able to inhibit the activity of the Target Protein, which resulted in an obvious slowing of invasion, with the reduction in invasion particularly being seen in the oncospheres. The two peptides also displayed modest suppression of an important cancer cell marker, which has a role in promoting cancer spread/metastasis and is also associated with drug and immune resistance in brain cancer. Both lead candidates are a fraction of the size and structural complexity of Chlorotoxin, a scorpion venom-derived peptide known to target brain cancer cells from scientific literature.

PreveCeutical is now accelerating the process of evaluating options on how best to progress the two lead peptide drug candidates, which may include partnering to expedite their pre-clinical evaluation. The pre-clinical outcomes, along with the Company’s IP coverage, would have the

\-2-  
potential to demonstrate proof of concept and enable the Company to further extend dialogue with

pharma R &amp; D / biotech companies active in the therapeutic neuro-oncology space.

PreveCeutical’s President and Chief Science Officer, Dr. Mak Jawadekar stated, “We are indeed quite excited to have accomplished further strides towards proof of concept for these innovative Nature IdenticalTM peptide therapeutics for application into the neuro-oncology therapeutic area and look forward to progressing them through proof of concept studies.”",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,427061,public,self,"PreveCeutical Announces Successful Completion from its Design, Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluation of Novel Designed Peptides Derived from Caribbean Blue Scorpion Venom in a Cell-Based Brain Cancer Model",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/douahv/preveceutical_announces_successful_completion/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,1572461498.0,,,,,,,

The question is do we pull the funds out of these stocks now or let them sit until better times before pulling them out? If you have a good argument to make for leaving the money in the stock I suppose we'd be open to that option as well the AST stock seems like it's doing terribly and cutting and running feels good. On the first energy stock it seems to be a proven money maker but right now it's higher than it's been in the last 5 years, maybe a good time to sell and reposition the money.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I have conflicting views on this. 

On one hand, investing into an actual company can give you opportunity for dividends, and even if the price of the metal goes down a little bit, they could still hold stable if they do a good job. Also, price gains and risk on precious metals are at least partially represented in the value of such a stock. One could say investing in the company that extracts the resources could be like ""gains on gains"" because you get the growth of the business multiplied by the value of their assets increasing.

On the other hand, if precious metals are so scarce, then doesn't this imply there could be a long term trend towards it being gradually harder to extract future metals? Wouldn't this mean that it's possible if not likely that the price of precious metals could increase due to scarcity, but the mining companies suffer because there's not much left to mine?

I guess the question I need to ask is, assuming someone might have some kind of an idea on the subject, how many precious metals are left on Earth, and is the trend of precious metal inflation constant or shifting in some direction? I would assume more metal inflation means it's better to invest in the mining companies, and less inflation means it's better to invest in the asset itself.

Though some analysts are worried about the company’s acquisition, straying somewhat from purely wireless sales, including DirecTV, Time Warner, and some smaller subsidiaries, their returns greatly outperform their competitors for the fiscal year, and I believe their reinvestments are properly allocated.

It said in a letter to Pennsylvania's Department of Labor and Industry on Wednesday that it would close its warehouse in York, effective December 31, and that all 56 employees there would be laid off permanently.

Swift Logistics is an entity within Knight-Swift, the fourth-largest trucking company in the US by revenue. The company did not immediately respond to inquiries from Business Insider.

Knight-Swift announced third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, disclosing that adjusted operating income had plunged by 27.4% from 2018.

A downturn is hitting the trucking industry — and now even large employers are getting slammed

Trucking has faced significant headwinds this year. It has been in a recession since the first half of 2019, according to ACT Research.

Read more: Another 4,200 truck drivers lost their jobs in September as a recession slams America's $800 billion trucking industry

In the first six months of 2019, about 640 trucking companies closed, according to industry data from Broughton Capital cited by The Wall Street Journal. That was more than triple the number from the same period last year, 175.

America slashed 9,300 trucking payrolls in September and August alone.

The recession in trucking has especially affected small carriers, who operate largely on the spot market.

Trucking loads can be picked up on demand through the spot market or through a prearranged contract. The contract market makes up most of the trucking market, according to the American Trucking Associations.



Spot-market rates have crashed in 2019, while contract market rates haven't seen the same dip.

But these layoffs from Swift Logistics suggest again that the trucking industry's contraction is affecting large companies too.

Roadrunner, the 31st-largest trucker in the US, announced last month that it was cutting 10% of its total workforce, all in its ""unprofitable"" dry-van sector.

Cold Carriers, a refrigerated trucking company with about 400 truck drivers, filed for bankruptcy protection late last month; it said it would continue operations as it restructures its debt obligations.

Meanwhile, industry leaders like J.B. Hunt and Schneider have slashed their annual outlooks this year.

With Windows 10, all modern gaming PCs can also easily double as an Xbox, which is essentially a slim gaming PC on it's side, with gamepass and included  Xbox gamebar software.  So to get the games and licensing/distribution fees that console developers actually earn their money on, (not the console itself), to the customer, Microsoft pretty much already has their new platform in most PC gamer's homes already.  The actual console will just gather up the remaining Xbox loyalists by giving them what amounts  to a gaming PC in a pretty box... an, Xbox if you will  ;)   I don't think Playstation can overcome this.  They won't fail, of course, but the competition is about to become highly unfair as the old  ""console vs PC"" battle lines are about to get very blurry.

$T is announcing Q3 reports pre-market on Monday. I’m a strong holder and very bullish on their main competitor, $VZ. However, I’m favoring both sides of this wireless duopoly.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/att-earnings-preview-what-to-expect-51571957799

I expect solid returns and projections for the quarter, likely topping Verizon’s ~$0.01 beat at EP. Though some analysts are worried about the company’s acquisition, straying somewhat from purely wireless sales, including DirecTV, Time Warner, and some smaller subsidiaries, their returns greatly outperform their competitors for the fiscal year, and I believe their reinvestments are properly allocated.

It’s too late for me to buy into a market surge, but I believe I probably should have. I expect about a 10% - 15% gain some time Monday morning.

I purchased 500 shares of an ETF at $64. I want to set up a  stop-limit to sell all 500 shares if the price hits my stop of $63.80.  But if the price goes up, I want to sell 200 shares at $64.50 and 300  shares at $65. 

I know how to do an OCO with just two orders (for instance if I  wanted a stop-limit at $63.80 and to sell everything above $65). But I  can't figure out how to create something with three orders like this  (with two or more limit orders above the current price, each selling a  portion of my holdings as the price moves up). 

I am using the ThinkOrSwim trading platform from Ameritrade. Whenever  I try to create the first two orders (the stop-limit at $63.80 and the  limit at $64.50), if I then try to create another limit order to sell  the remaining 300 shares at $65, then thinkorswim cancels the first  order (because it treats it as conflicting with the stop-limit, I  think).

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019.

# **The Fed and Apple earnings will make or break market’s return to record highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/25/the-fed-could-be-what-makes-or-breaks-the-stock-markets-push-into-record-territory.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&amp;P 500 companies get set to report.
*****
&gt; Stock prices are bumping up against their highs, but whether they can burst through and hold gains may, for the near term, depend on what investors hear from Jerome Powell in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; In a week stacked with major events, the Fed’s two-day meeting is likely to be the high point. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to make its third quarter point interest rate cut Wednesday afternoon, followed by comments form Fed Chairman Powell. Those comments could be his most important message of the next few months, as investors watch to see whether he holds the door open to future rate cuts, or signals it’s time to pause, as some economists expect.
*****
&gt; “Our view is they’ll be done after this. We’re not expecting a cut in December, and we’re not expecting cuts next year. The economy, in my mind, looks like it’s stabilizing, and there should be more evidence of that in the next couple of weeks. focusing on the labor market is the key thing,” said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. If the labor market holds up, expectations for rate cuts should decline. “I do think the dissenters are arguing they shouldn’t be cutting at all.”
*****
&gt; But Matus’ view is just one of many on Wall Street. Some economists expect another cut in December, while others expect one or more cuts next year, depending on how they view the economy. Goldman Sachs economists laid out a case where the Fed will clearly signal that it plans to pause after Wednesday.
*****
&gt; All of this could make for volatility in stocks and bonds, depending on which market view prevails in Powell’s comments. “It’s going to be choppy going into the Fed,” said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. In the past week, yields were higher with the 10-year Treasury yield touching 1.8% Friday.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.2% for the week, ending at 3,022, just below its closing high. On Friday, it briefly traded above the July 26 high of 3,025. The Dow ended the week with a gain of 0.7%, at 26,956, and it remains about 1% below its closing high.
*****
&gt; In addition, the earnings calendar remains heavy with about 145 S&amp;P 500 companies releasing earnings, including Alphabet Monday and big oil Exxon Mobil and Chevron Friday. On Wednesday, earnings are expected from Apple, which is setting new highs of its own.
*****
&gt; # Big economic reports

&gt; On top of that, November kicks off Friday in what looks to be the most important day for economic data of the new month. Besides the critical monthly employment report, there is the key ISM manufacturing report, expected to show a contraction in manufacturing activity for a third month.
*****
&gt; Both reports could be distorted by the GM strike, which is expected to result in an October employment report with fewer than 100,000 jobs. According to Refinitiv, total non farm payrolls are expected to be 90,000, while manufacturing jobs are expected to decline by 50,000. That would include the impact of GM workers, but also the employees of the many suppliers and services that support the car company’s manufacturing operations.
*****
&gt; “The jobs number will be big, but the ISM could be bigger. If that turns up, like Markit [PMI] suggested, that could be a big deal,” said Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist James Paulsen. On Thursday, Markit flash PMI manufacturing data for October was higher than expected, and still has not shown a contraction.
*****
&gt; “If it turns up, I think that’s to affect a lot of people and how they feel about things. That could take on a whole new dimension of what happens to Wall Street earnings estimates,” he said.
*****
&gt; Manufacturing data has dragged, due to the impact of tariffs and the trade war, and some big companies have taken a hit as a result, like Caterpillar which on Wednesday reported weaker than expected earnings and sales. Caterpillar also cut its outlook, in large part due to weakness in China. Caterpillar shares were slammed but on Friday, the stock was bouncing back by 3.5%.
*****
&gt; # Stocks at ‘inflection point’

&gt; Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s chief market strategist, said the fact Caterpillar was able to come back at the end of the week was a positive for the market, which she says is now entering the late year seasonal period where stocks typically do well. At the same time, she said news for the market looks like it’s about to get “less bad.”
*****
&gt; ″″Less bad’ is not a full fledged agreement with China. Less bad is a truce. It means that Dec. 15 extension in tariffs does not happen,” she said, adding the market appears to be at an inflection point with investors expecting an agreement of some type between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping when they meet in November.
*****
&gt; ″‘I’m not bullish. I’m not bearish. I’m optimistic. This market has been led by the defensive sectors. You’re starting to see that move into consumer discretionary. It’s telling you the market is seeing growth, albeit it not stellar growth, but when it gets ‘less bad’ you’re going to see that it’s being reflected in this inflection point in the market,” said said. “We’re seeing a move more and more into the cyclical and growth sectors, and by the way, we’re seeing a steepening of the yield curve.”
*****
&gt; The yield curve represents the difference between the yields of two different duration Treasury securities. When the curve inverts, the yield on the shorter duration security, in this case the 2-year has become higher than that of say, the 10-year. That is one part of the curve that was temporarily inverted, and if it stayed inverted it would be a recession warning.
*****
&gt; The 10-year has been moving higher, and the 1.80% level will be important if the yield can stay above it.
*****
&gt; “If it pushes through 1.80, you’re going to take the inversion out, by the bond market, not the Fed,” Paulsen said. Paulsen said it would be a sign of confidence in the economy if yields can push higher.
*****
&gt; The Fed taking a pause may add to that sense. “I think most people think one more cut and done,” he said. “The bigger news will be what [Powell] says in that press conference. He can go pretty off script sometimes.”
*****
&gt; # ‘Greater optimsim’ in market

&gt; Paulsen said stocks could be in a good period, and earnings news seems to be already priced in. “The data by and large has been okay. You have earnings that are okay, and there’s no sense of imminent recession. It just seems there’s greater optimism,” he said.
*****
&gt; Of the approximately 200 S&amp;P companies that reported by Friday morning, more than 78% have beaten on earnings per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to decline by 2% for the third quarter, based on estimates and results from companies that already reported.
*****
&gt; Paulsen said there’s some sense in the market that Brexit will not end in a worst case scenario, but it is something to watch in the week ahead as British lawmakers decide whether to hold an election.
*****
&gt; Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with Cresset Wealth Advisors, said he thinks Brexit would be a bigger deal than the trade agreement for the world economy, if it goes poorly, with the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal. “A no deal Brexit is likely to take 2 percentage points off of British growth...It would take 1% off European growth...I think that’s significant,” Ablin said. “I think investors are underplaying it because it’s so binary. It’s hard to position for a binary outcome. If we get some resolution there, to me, that has the biggest impact for the markets.”

# Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy Treat Next Week

&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 25 years. From the tables below:
* Dow up 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.4%.
* S&amp;P up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.5%.
* NASDAQ up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.7%, median gain 2.3%.
* Russell 2000 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.2%, median gain 2.5%.

&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains are made from October 31 to April 30, while the market goes sideways to down from May through October.

&gt; Since 1950 DJIA is up 7.5% November-April and up only 0.6% May-October. We encouraged folks not to fear Octoberphobia early this month and wait for our MACD Buy Signal which came on October 11. We have been positioning more bullishly since in sector and major U.S. market ETFs and with a new basket of stocks. But the next seven days have been a historically bullish trade.

# Normally a top month, November has been lackluster in Pre-Election Years

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000’s (since 1979).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef59a01a84a6391160b8624e5d05acf0/795865009b4c2002-94/s400x600/2d11d5ae114446e6162b685da1210ec1c8e83e73.jpg))**

&gt; In pre-election years, November’s performance is noticeably weaker. DJIA has advanced in nine of the last 17 pre-election years since 1950 with an average gain of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 has been up in 10 of the past 17 pre-election years, also gaining on average a rather paltry 0.3%. Small-caps and techs perform better with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 10 pre-election years, averaging 1.2%. NASDAQ has been up in 7 of the last 12 pre-election year Novembers with an average 0.9% gain. Contributing to pre-election year November’s weaker performance are nasty declines in 1987, 1991 and 2007.

# Q4 Rally Is Real. Don’t Let 2018 Spook You

&gt; Understandably folks are apprehensive about the perennial fourth quarter rally this year after the debacle that culminated in the Christmas Eve Crumble in 2018. But the history is clear. The fourth quarter is the best quarter of the year going back to 1949, except for NASDAQ where Q1 leads Q4 by 4.5% to 4.0%, since 1971.

&gt; Historically, the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Election Cycle is the three-quarter span from Q4 Midterm Year through Q2 Pre-Election Year, averaging a gain of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971. Conversely the weakest two-quarter span is Q2-Q3 of the Midterm Year, averaging a loss of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.

&gt; Market action was impacted by some more powerful forces in 2018 that trumped (no pun intended) seasonality. Q2-Q3 was up 9.8% for DJIA, 10.3% for S&amp;P and 13.9% for NASDAQ. Q4 was horrible, down -11.8% for DJIA, -14.0% for S&amp;P and -17.5% for NASDAQ.Q1-Q2 of pre-election year, especially Q1 gained all that back.

&gt; Pre-Election year Q4 is still one of the best quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, ranked 5th, for average gains of 2.6% for DJIA and 3.2% for S&amp;P since 1949 and 5.4% for NASDAQ. Additionally, from the Pre-Election Seasonal Pattern we updated in last Friday’s post, you can see how the market tends to make a high near yearend in the Pre-Election Year. So, save some new unexpected outside event, Q4 Market Magic is expected to impress once again this year.

# 2019 May Be One of the Best Years Ever

&gt; “Everything is awesome, when you’re living out a dream.” The Lego Movie

&gt; As the S&amp;P 500 Index continues to flirt with new record highs, something under the surface is taking place that is making 2019 extremely special. Or dare we say, “awesome”.

&gt; First, let’s look back at last year. 2018 was the first year since 1969 in which both the S&amp;P 500 (stocks) and the 10-year Treasury bond (bonds) both finished the year with a negative return. Toss in the fact that gold and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil were both down last year, and it was one of the worst years ever for a diversified portfolio.

&gt; “As bad as last year was for investors, 2019 is a mirror image, with stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil all potentially finishing the year up double digits for the first time in history,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it has been a great year for stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil. Of course, there are still more than two months to go in 2019, but this year is shaping up to be one of the best years ever for these four important assets.

# An Early Look at Earnings

&gt; We're now in the thick of the Q3 earnings reporting period with 130 companies reporting since just the close last night. As shown in our Earnings Explorer snapshot below, earnings will be in overdrive for the next two weeks before dying down in mid-November.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/explorer.png))**

&gt; Through yesterday's close, 248 companies had reported so far this season, and 75% of them had beaten consensus bottom-line EPS estimates. However, just 63% of stocks have beaten sales estimates, and more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance. In terms of stock price reaction to reports this season, so far investors have seen earnings as relatively bullish as the average stock that has reported has gained 0.60% on its earnings reaction day. Below we show another snapshot from our Earnings Explorer featuring the aggregate results of this season's reports and a list of the stocks that have reacted the most positively to earnings. Four stocks so far have gained more than 20% on their earnings reaction days -- PETS, BIIB, APHA, and LLNW.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsstats.png))**

&gt; We provide clients with a beat-rate monitor on our Earnings Explorer page as well. Below is a chart showing the rolling 3-month EPS and sales beat rates for US companies over the last 5 years. After a dip in the EPS beat rate earlier in the year, we've seen it steadily increase over the last few months up to its current level of 64.46%. That's more than five percentage points above the historical average of 59.37%.

&gt; In terms of sales, 57.87% of companies have beaten top-line estimates over the last 3 months, which is much closer to the historical average than the bottom-line beat rate.

# Banks - On To The Next Test

&gt; It has been a pretty monumental two weeks for the KBW Bank index. Since the close on 10/8, the index has rallied just under 9% as earnings reports from some of the largest US banks received a warm welcome from Wall Street. The index is now once again testing the top-end of its range, one which it has unsuccessfully tested multiple times in the last year. If you think the repeated tests of 3,000 for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 18 months have been dramatic, the current go around with 103 for the KBW Bank Index has been the sixth such test in the last year! We would also note that prior to last year's fourth quarter downturn, the same level that has been acting as resistance for the KBW Bank index was previously providing support.

&gt; In the case of each prior failed break above 103 for the KBW Bank index, sell-offs of at least 5% (and usually 10%+) followed, but one thing the index has going for it even if the sixth time isn't the charm is that just yesterday it broke above its downtrend that has been in place since early 2018. The group has passed one test at least! From here, if we do see a pullback, that former downtrend line should provide support.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks.png))**

&gt; Turning to the KBW Index's individual components, the table below lists each of the 24 stocks in the index along with how each one has performed since the index's recent low on 10/8 and on a YTD basis (sorted by performance since 10/8). In the slightly more than two weeks since the index's short-term low, every stock in the index is up and up by at least 4%. That's a pretty broad rally!

&gt; Leading the way to the upside, State Street (STT) has rallied nearly 20%, while First Republic (FRC), Northern Trust (NTRS), and Bank of America (BAC) have jumped more than 13%. In the case of STT, the rally of the last two-weeks has also moved the stock into the green on a YTD basis.

Among them Microsoft, Paypal and Intel pleased the markets while Amazon, eBay and Twitter disappointed. Looking beyond the larger names there were also some interesting  small and mid cap developments.

**Consumer Cyclical** 

**Skechers** dropped  4% after hours on Tuesday following strong Q3 results. Sales were up 15.1% (17.2% on a constant currency basis), gross margins were up 30 bps and net income was up 13.6%. Q4 Guidance was for sales of and EPS of $0.35-$0.40 compared to $0.31 last year.

It appears that investors were profit taking after a 40% increase this year and the stock has pretty much fully recovered all of those losses. 

Skechers' brands have been resonating with influencers and key opinion leaders globally even if it has failed so far to resonate with investors. The brand lacks the macho appeal of Nike and Under Armour. However, in the current environment, I would consider that to be a positive.

Currently trading on $37.89 with a market cap of $5.94 billion, the PE of 17.57 looks cheap compared to recent growth and peers. Adjusting for almost $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents the PE ratio improves further to 14.8.

&amp;#x200B;

**Airlines**

**JetBlue** was up on Tuesday after reporting strong Q3 results. Adjusted earnings were up 32% and the CEO said the company was still ""on track to deliver on our goal of $2.50 to 3.00 dollars EPS in 2020""

RASM was hit in the Caribbean by Hurricane Dorian but offset by cost improvements. Domestically RASM outperformed the industry and improved by over 3%.

Stock price increased to $18.76 but still looks cheap compared to 2020 guidance. Beyond 2020 JBLU's plan to ditch 60 Embraer regional jets (and operate solely Airbus aircraft) should improve fuel efficiency and reduce operating costs further.

&amp;#x200B;

**Healthcare (Biogen and PDL BioPharma)**

**Biogen** stock jumped 40% on Tuesday after the company announced it was reviving its approval application for Alzheimer drug Aducanumab. It was thought that that drug was dead in the water but new analysis of a larger dataset shows that the terminated Phase 3 EMERGE study met the primary endpoint . 

Like others, I remain sceptical about the reversal of test results and feel that the likelihood of FDA approval is by no means certain. But this is an asset that had been thought capable of generating $10 to $20 billion in sales. Even a 50/50 chance of winning approval with chunky margins and growing global demand would be significant. Biogen still trades on a trailing PE of 10.3, even after Tuesday jump, and that market valuation looks very attractive.

Engine Capital published a letter on Wednesday calling on **PDL BioPharma** to consider strategic options including a possible sale or liquidation of the Company.  Now Engine Capital isn’t what you would call a well known entity but they point out that they have had numerous discussion with senior management, former employees and competitors and believe that the company has a number of high-quality assets. What we can see and what looks interesting is;

1.  PDLI’s book value per share of $5.35 compares very favourably to the current $2.71 share price

2. a net cash position of $156 million compares well to a market cap of $310 million

3. Engine Capital’s belief that there is scope to cut about $20 million out of PDLIs cost base looks reasonable and meaningful compared to the $310 million market cap and TTM PE 8.2.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value Stock**

Hewlett Packard Enterprises issues upbeat guidance on Thursday with EPS of $1.78 to $1.94 forecast for 2020 and long run CAGR of 7-9%. This is not the printing company rather it’s the technology company that serves cloud computing and storage centres. HPE has improved profitability across the company and now plans to offer everything as-a-Service to continue to drive profitable growth. Trading on 9.3x current year estimates it looks like good value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cyclicals** 

**Whirlpool** reported GAAP EPS of $5.57 compared to $3.22 last year on Tuesday. However adjusting for tax and gains on the sale of the compressor business to Nidec, EPS were $3.97 compared to $4.55 last year. 

The company said it was trending towards the high end of its ongoing EPS guidance range of $14.75 to $15.50. That compares to Fridays stock price close at $15.36. However this is a cyclical stock and with the stock up over 50% this year I would say it’s fully valued.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insider Buying**

On Tuesday, RV manufacturer,  **Thor Industries** CEO Robert Martin picked up nearly $600,000 of stock after setting out on Monday the company’s key three targets for the year 2025 including 

1. $14 billion in annual net sales

2. Sustainable gross margins of 16%

3. Generate over $3 billion in cumulative net cash from operations

That signals a vote of confidence in ambitious targets that forecast a doubling of sales. The stock price has fallen more than 50% due to concerns that the company has increased debt, to acquire Erwin Hymer Group, just as it approaches the top of the cycle. I think that Thor has started to make progress in paying down that debt but I am concerned about where we are with the business cycle and don’t believe there is really upside after recent gains.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other**

The Tile Shop stock price ended the week down 50% at $1.63 after  management reported plans to delist from the Nasdaq. Cabell Lolmaugh, the Company' s CEO, said ""we believe the savings that will benefit our shareholders outweigh the advantages of continuing as a Nasdaq-listed and SEC reporting company"". I think he needs to reconsider.

long story short:

I bought tesla originally at 220 and sold at 258 about a week ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent days upon days pouring through their financials, looking at every article and press release i could find prior to their recent q3 2019 . i came to the conclusion that the stock should have a price around 350 and was quite confident heading in to this earnings call.

i then continued reading and researching masses of articles to make sure i didnt miss anything and poured over statements from giant hedge fund and billion dollar portfolio managers and managed to convince myself that i must be missing something because these people handling so much capital and who were so ""much smarter than me"" all had an across the board shared consensus opinion of negative EPS and there must be some flaw in the company that i wasn't seeing. i allowed this doubt to overrule my technical analysis of the stock price and sold prior to the q3 earnings call for a meager profit.

&amp;#x200B;

tesla is currently $328 a share and to say i am feeling burned is a massive understatement, i learned an incredibly valuable lesson however which is the reason for this post;

However, RRC is the best operator in this bad neighborhood with Applachian assets second to none. There are 3 reason to seriously consider buying the stock.

1) In a July 25, 2019 press release, management announced the sale of 2% of forward revenues in the form of a royalty interest for $600 million in cash. At that time, RRC's market cap was $1 billion. In other words, 2% of revenues sold for 60% of the company's market cap.

2) In the recent 3rd quarter earnings announcement, management revealed another transaction of similar importance. After the July asset sale, RRC sold another 0.5% of revenues for $150 million in cash. This is the same price per $ of revenue as received in the previous sale (0.5% = 25% of 2%, $150 million = 25% of $600 million) demonstrating that the first sale was not some weird fluke.

3) In the earnings presentation, management showed a slide highlighting how simple math values the company's proved reserves are worth $24 per share at the current market price of natural gas. Proved reserves are not a guess. They are an audited, defined value. 

4) The company also announced a share buyback program of $100 million (or 10% of the market cap) in the same earning announcement.

This is a $4 stock. Low priced stock are volatile so the shares could drop to $3 for no apparent reason in the short term, but it is clear that management believes their stock to be massively undervalued and determined to slap this fact into the market's face over and over again with small asset sales until people wake up.

Half a year has passed since the post. I continued to purchase $TSLA stock throughout April and May 2019. My thesis has not changed, nor my conviction. Tesla continue to execute their plans. I am holding long-term but I wanted to provide an update, and a prediction (see further down).

&amp;nbsp;

Just so everyone's clear: I've been acquiring Tesla stock since early 2016. It's just that 6 months ago, I found myself facepalming so hard at how much analysts, media and ""investors"" were missing or just had plain wrong. I'm an opportunistic investor. I saw opportunity but didn't have much cash so instead of buying with savings, I nuked most of my stock portfolio and bought more Tesla.

&amp;nbsp;

The stock is $316.73 as I type this on the back of strong Q3 results.

**Predictions:**

&amp;nbsp;

- Short squeeze underway.

&amp;nbsp;

- Q4 2019 results will be bonkers. Record everything that matters including net profit, production, deliveries, gross margins. This is so obvious it hurts.

- By Q4 2020, Giga 3 should be fully ramped, Giga Europe will be under construction, annual output over 500,000, over $5 billy in the bank.

&amp;nbsp;

- Unless Elon drops LSD with Joe Rogan very soon, this is probably the last time we'll see the stock under $300.

&amp;nbsp;

- Stock will continue on a bumpy, upward trajectory throughout the 2020s.

The year was 2014, and AMZN had been trading in the low-mid 300 range all year after hitting an all-time high of \~400 in January, so it was a bit of a down year.  I don't remember exactly what was going on inside the company at the time, but then, on 23 October 2014, it missed on earnings and the price ""plummeted"" the next day, trading in the 280s/290s.  

On that day, it just so happened that I was kind of stranded in the middle of Camp Pendleton with shyte signal, no computers anywhere nearby, and busy AF running a 75-person detachment on 24 hour operations.  It was only a coincidence that I saw the AMZN news because it had been reported in mainstream media and I got an alert on my phone.  I had been watching the company for a few months and thought to myself, what a great day to buy!  They will certainly recover, this company is solid.   

So I whip out my phone, but I didn't have my brokerage app installed... I've only had a smartphone for two years at this point and still wasn't comfortable putting my financial-related apps on there.  But I said to myself, screw it, you can't miss this opportunity.  So I try downloading the app... but, again, shyte signal... download failed.  Try again... download failed.  I tried this for about an hour until while things were quiet, then everything got busy again and I had to abandon my quest to download the app.  

Next thing I know, market is closed, ahhh damn I missed my chance I say to myself.  I get home from camp Pendleton two weeks later and see that the price has now ""recovered"" to 300+ and I figure, oh well not going to buy it now.  

Yeah, so I know everyone has their ""one that got away"" but hot-damn it's not always so easy to pinpoint the moment in time when it happened.  And I would have held it... I'm a long-term investor.  So yeah, that's my unsolicited sob story.

In any case, I haven't learned my lesson because even though AMZN stock price will plummet again today due to missed earnings, I'm not going to buy it... I'll never be able to decouple my emotions from that stock, I'll just let my ETFs and MFs with AMZN holdings deal with it for now.

&amp;#x200B;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

They earned $0.34 per share (425 million) Vs the $0.26 per share forecast.  Seems like a decent beat so I was surprised to see that they actually had an operating loss of $261 Million.  The loss before taxes was $19 million .  The only reason they posted a positive quarter was due to a $442 million tax benefit.  This seemed like an unusually large amount so I dug deeper into the filling.  Next is the direct quote from the filing about the benefit.  

""In the third quarter, we recognized a tax benefit of $442 million, primarily from non-U.S. restructuring items, resulting in a tax rate of 2,326% on our $19 million loss before income taxes.""  Yes you read that percentage right.

Management offered little explanation as to why it was so substantial but I am assuming it is related to the $1 billion in special item losses related to its global restructuring efforts.  That includes an $800 million impairment charge for fixed assets in India related to its joint venture with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra.  There are some positives in the report as well but this was what I found to be the most striking.

Yet the weak results sent the retail giant’s shares, which ended trading at $1,780.78, tumbling over 7% in post-market trading.

Here were the key numbers, according to a consensus forecast from Bloomberg:

Revenue: $70 billion vs. $68.7 billion expected

GAAP earnings per share: $4.23 vs. $4.58 expected

Amazon Web Services: $9 billion vs. $9.19 billion expected

Much of the quarter’s upside was driven by Amazon Prime’s higher membership price tag, and the rollout of free next-day delivery announced in April — leading to a 24% boost in sales and cash flow from the comparable year-ago quarter. 

At least some of Amazon’s sales growth was offset by higher marketing and shipping costs. Amazon previously warned that the investment in one-day shipping was exceeding the $800 million it originally allotted for the task, and intended to spend at least as much in Q3.

It appears much of that investment will drag on fourth quarter and full-year expectations, with Amazon forecasting Q4 net sales to fall between $80.0 billion and $86.5 billion, representing 11% and 20% compared with fourth quarter 2018, subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. Operating income is expected to be between $1.2 billion and $2.9 billion, compared with $3.8 billion in fourth quarter 2018.

As you can see I changed the title of the post simply because a few people aren't getting the idea of what the post is about and wasting time shouting in the comments how wrong I am or talking about option puts etc which don't apply to me I don't trade options. I really couldn't say if this system would work for options because I really know nothing about them. 

I say in my posts/videos if these things line up, earnings release, trend, market direction then finally pre-market then I will trade this stock. Now if all four of those things don't line up then it is a no trade. That is very simple, right? 

It isn't that difficult to understand unless you are being deliberately stupid and just want to leave bad comments. And if so then I just feel sorry for you. From today I won't reply to negative or stupid comments simply because I really can't be bothered.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Today's possibilities.

 

American Electric Power Company, Inc.(AEP)

The stock is in an uptrend, earnings are expected to be good and the market is slightly up. Again if the earnings are good keep an eye on the pre-market it that stays in the green too then it is a trade, if not leave it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Astrazeneca PLC Common Stock (AZN)

Same as the previous choice but more of a possibility because the earnings is estimates to be slightly higher.

 

Comcast Corporation Class A Common Stock (CMCSA)

Finally my main choice of the day. Good solid fundamentals, plus expected positive earnings. 

&amp;#x200B;

No video today as I am sick.

The world's largest planemaker also said it was delaying plans to step up production on its money-spinning 737 line in the Seattle area, and would not hit a record-level 57 aircraft monthly until late 2020, months later than previously planned.

Despite the trio of industrial setbacks, Boeing shares were up 2.6% in morning trading as its steady estimate of a 737 MAX return in the fourth quarter appeared to be eclipsing the downside of the 787 production cut and other problems, an analyst said.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,424042,public,self,Boeing profit slumps 53% as MAX crisis deepens,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dm0qnl/boeing_profit_slumps_53_as_max_crisis_deepens/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,1572210099.0,,,,,,,

Skechers' brands have been resonating with influencers and key opinion leaders globally even if it has failed so far to resonate with investors.  For the fourth time in the past five years, this week Skechers was awarded the “Best of Manhattan.” and “Pay it Forward” awards. 

The brand lacks the macho appeal of Nike and Under Armour but in the current environment that should be a good thing.  Additionally women and children account for almost 70% of Skechers' sales compared to sales to women accounting for 25% at Nike.

There is only one stock today! Boeing (BA)

With Boeing's problems and an expected loss of around 20% then this is going to be a sell/short. Watch pre-market as usual be wary, don't use too much leverage as nothing is ever guaranteed! 

Yesterday was a bust but then that is the way it goes. I didn't lose anything because my trading system said that it was a no trade. I think I missed out on HAS because the trend for that stock was slightly down but never mind that is how it goes. A dollar saved is a dollar earned. 

I hope you all have a great day! 

I will post the video later but nothing really to say as the trade itself is fairly simple. (hopefully it will upload today)

The integrity of Boeing’s corporate culture is now under the spotlight, whether it deserves to be or not, and the probability of more negative stories emerging has increased.

Boeing has moved quickly to get their spin on the story out saying “it is obvious that there was no ‘lie’” and that “Mark thought the plane was safe, and the simulator would be fixed.” However, having read the transcript (see link below) neither of these comments really stand up.

The question of whether Boeing knew beforehand of a problem but chose to move forward due to commercial pressures will undoubtedly be raised at the congressional committee hearing next week at which CEO Dennis Muilenburg is expected to testify.  It is difficult to see how, innocent or not, Boeing can spin this to their advantage.

Boeing’s stock price has held up so far on the basis that (with a high probability c.90%) the 737 Max will be fixed and flying again early next year, customer trust will return quickly with FAA approval and that (operating in a duopoly with huge order back logs) EPS will recover quickly to $16+ and that a PE of 20 will allow the stock price to recover again to $400+.

The problem is that the 90% certainty is now falling and the stock price is wobbling as near term risks increase.  At the same time there is no upside.  There will be no good news or FAA approval for Boeing while this hearing and scandal about the instant messages hang over the company.  

I still expect everything will probably be ok for Boeing.  Nevertheless, with no apparent upside, I would avoid this stock until next weeks hearing has passed and is disappearing in the rear view window.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.

The ratings agency said the ongoing MAX grounding could further delay the aircraft's return to service and have a lasting impact on the company's reputation, profitability, and financial strength.

Lyft will be profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the fourth quarter of 2021, which is one year earlier than analysts were expecting, Green said in an interview Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal’s WSJ Tech Live conference. EBITDA is a measure of operating profits before financing-related expenses like interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

“We have in the bank over $3 billion, we have a clear path to profitability and the team is executing well,” Zimmer said. “We need to build trust with a new class of investors and with two quarters beating expectations, we’re excited for the next few quarters.”

Lyft and rival ride-sharing service Uber have been in a race to reach profitability amid growing investor skepticism around money-losing tech companies. Shares of Uber and Lyft have dropped sharply from their IPO prices of $45 and $72 a share, respectively.

Lyft went public in March with ballooning losses of $900 million and no clear path to profitability. Since then, it has shown signs of breaking even. The company reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter and CFO Brian Roberts said he believes Lyft reached peak losses in 2018.

What a tragic day it's been, after only trading for a few months. Let me start this by saying my emotions got the best of me, and it really hurt. I wasn't ready or expecting to take the loss I did, but I did learn a lot about myself in such a short period of time. Let's go over the trade today:

I am subscribed to warrior tradings chatroom. He's been amazing at giving his mindset, and helping people like me emulate a winning mindset. So today he was watching BOXL, a running stock. In case you don't know, he calls everything out live in his room. I put typed in BOXL and saw it at 2.80. Then I hear him call out that he's gotten long in a position. Seeing how there were many stocks that ran in the past week, this seemed like another. SES and BIMI have both ran in the past few days, so I didn't want to miss the next big runner. As usual, I was slow to place my orders in. I ended up getting filled at 2.93, and added again at 3. Then a nightmare happened, it didn't break 3 and snapped back down. Now at this point, warrior said he was ready to bail. I was in my position full size, and stuck down 30 cents with a 2.97 average long. Then, next thing I know the stock doesn't bounce and warriors out of his position. Unfortunately, my emotions got the best of me, and I held on. It held 2.70 well, and I was thinking it was going to squeeze all the way to about 3.50 for a nice gain, but it didn't. It broke 2.70, and snapped all the way to 2.50, where I covered at 2.48 for a blow up loss. My emotions got the best of me and I was greedy when I should've taken it off at $3 when warrior said it was holding. Instead, I held and held, until it was over.

This experience has been extremely important as a learning and educational experience. I'm going to come back stronger, and not let my emotions get the best of me. Next month I'll be coming back in pursuit of becoming a top 5% trader, funding my account, and re-subscribe to get a better education.

Around 15 years ago I knew someone online who talked about how they made a good living doing nothing but day trading all day using technical analysis methods.

I considered giving it a try back then, but didn't.

Today I'm wondering if it's still a viable way to make money as a full time job, or if changes in technology and markets have altered that strategy.

Why would time alter it?

1. I've heard that with the increased processing power and AI sophistication that big players in the markets are able to make more money by buying and selling on very small margins using automated systems. If these systems were really that common they could feasibly alter the way the market behaves and how easy it is for an individual doing things manually to scrap off their profits.
2. Maybe the markets behave differently after both the tech bubble burst and the the housing crisis? All the books I bought on the subject are at least 15-20 years old.
3. Potentially more people trying to day trade and do technical analysis could potentially alter the way it works and how easy it is, couldn't it? Maybe things weren't as sophisticated 20 years ago and fewer people were trying to do it?",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,423529,public,self,Does Technical Analysis still work to make a living daytrading with?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dlkgnn/does_technical_analysis_still_work_to_make_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,1572193645.0,,,,,,,

I figured someone else might find it useful if they’re doing the same and needed a tracking sheet. All the calculations are preset with formulas – the only thing you need to add is the premiums of your sold options earned, quantity, your initial stock purchase(s), and the current stock price (oh, and of course the stock name/ticker). 

Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/uYf8ac7

So in my current display, I am selling weekly(ish) covered calls on my 100 shares of Sprint. At the current pace, I will need about 62 more weeks to make my initial investment of $615 when I bought the original 100 shares (i.e. +100% profit or double). If we factor in the profits/losses based on market value of the stocks since purchase, then I will need 59 weeks. Not a bad “dividend” rate!

Note: This value is not technically correct since I skipped one week (projection formula is configured based on contract counts, not weeks). So in theory it could take longer or shorter depending on your contract writing frequency. Will probably revisit and correct at a later time.

I saw some posts on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) about people making a lot of return on puts on stocks that are going down. So, stupid me I saw $LK stock up 5% for the day on Monday and I thought it would swing back. I don't understand puts very well and I am USUALLY smarter to not get involved in something that I don't understand. I thought maybe it could be a learning experience even if I lose some money.

\- I bought a $20 put on $LK at $0.65 for $65 (100 shares). $LK is up almost 3% today and I'm down $32. What happens if I go down to $0 (does the put just disappear?)?  
\- I'm not sure if I should wait until Friday when it expires and lose another $33.  
\- Can I sell the put anytime I want?  
\- How can one calculate the math behind calls and puts to assess my risk-reward?
