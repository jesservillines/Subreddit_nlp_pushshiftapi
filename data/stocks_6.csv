**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co bowed to a growing cash squeeze by suspending commercial 737 production from January for the first time in more than 20 years, as the grounding of the planemaker's best-selling MAX after two fatal crashes drags into 2020.

Boeing, which builds the 737 south of Seattle, said it would not lay off any of the roughly 12,000 employees there during the production freeze, though the move could have repercussions across its global supply chain and the U.S. economy.

The decision at a two-day board meeting came after the Federal Aviation Administration refused to approve the jet's return to service before 2020 and delivered what was seen as a public rebuff to Boeing's hopes of moving faster.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,451226,public,self,Boeing crisis deepens as 737 production stops for first time in two decades,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ebosko/boeing_crisis_deepens_as_737_production_stops_for/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That comes on the heels of the U.S. and China announced on Friday that a limited trade deal had been reached.

Yet, silver trails gold in terms of gains in 2019. While gold is almost up 15% in 2019. The 200 EMA is at 17.14, which is below resistance at 17.25. The 50-day EMA is 16.72.  


Oftentimes, the silver price lags behind gold, but closely follows.

Despite that silver has not increased like gold, the so-called “poor man’s gold” still had a good year. Silver advanced 16.9%.

Silverbugs will want to keep an eye on the U.S.-China trade situation and global growth prospects. Standard Chartered precious metals analyst Suki Cooper.

“For silver, trade negotiations are one of the key risks. Given the impact, it has on industrial demand growth, economic growth, and outlook for the tech sector,”Suki Cooper told Kitco News. “We do expect the Federal Reserve to remain on hold in 2020, but there will likely be continued concerns around the U.S.-China trade negotiations… Given that there is still negative-yielding debt on a global basis, this is likely to create a positive backdrop for safe-haven assets.”

Brexit, too, will play a role in silver prices.

“For gold and silver, it is going to be the macro-environment that is a key driver,” she said. “We think the trade tensions will be the underlying theme for the complex as a whole, whether that’s going to impact industrial demand or auto sector growth. Or whether that triggers safe-haven interest in gold and silver.”

According to RJO Futures senior market strategist Philip Streible. The Dutch bank ABN AMRO projects silver to reach $18 an ounce by year-end after averaging $16.60 throughout 2020.

“We think that an aggressive sell-off in silver prices in the coming months will be an opportunity to position for higher prices later in 2020,” ABN AMRO senior FX and precious metals strategist Georgette Boele said. “Silver prices will probably be more supported if global growth and global trade start to stabilize and improve somewhat.”

TD Securities strategists believe silver could peak even higher. “Silver \[could\] jump to $20/oz by the end of 2020 in response to its firming fundamentals and spillover investment demand from the yellow metal,” the bank’s strategists told Kitco News.

TD Securities strategist Daniel Ghali added: “A lot of the drags on growth, such as print episodes of deleveraging in China, tightening in the U.S, all been flashed out. Going forward, we should see some improvement.”  
Standard Chartered believes silver could average $17.50 in 2020. In Q2, it could reach a peak of $18.

“Gold has seen considerable safe haven buying from investors concerned \[over\] low and negative yields in the bond market and fearing a possible downturn in equities,” said George Milling-Stanley, chief gold strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Gold exchange-traded funds have also been “feeling the benefit of strategic asset allocation type buying by institutions and individuals.”

He added: “Ongoing uncertainties, both macroeconomic and geopolitical have provided support for both types of buying.”  


Gold remained steady on Monday as investors sought clarity on what “phase one” of the trade deal between the United States and China would be.  


Spot gold decreased 0.1% to $1,474.46 per ounce on Monday after gaining 1.1% last week.  


“This (trade deal) does not mean things get fundamentally better; it essentially means they’re not going to get any deeper into a slowdown … There still are risks down the road,” said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities. “A combination of expectations of high (trade) deficit, lower interest rates and U.S. political risks emerging during election year, all point to investors wanting to at least have some gold in their portfolio.”

The uncertainty over what “phase one” will look like has kept gold steady.  
“These overall concerns are still keeping gold prices relatively elevated,”said FXTM market analyst Han Tan.

Elsewhere, palladium jumped 2% to $1,969.41 an ounce. The autocatalyst metal struck an all-time high of $1,979.95 on Friday, when it also snapped a 15 session-long winning streak that saw it repeatedly breaking new records.  
Gold futures ended on Friday at $1,481.20 per ounce. The prices of the most-active contract up 15% year to date, making it the largest yearly rise since 2010, back when prices increased by nearly 30%.

Milling-Stanley is surprised by how quickly gold increase in price after sitting below $1,350 level this past summer, constituting “the upper bound of the trading range that had been in existence for six years, since the spring of 2013.”

In June, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he would “make a mid-cycle adjustment and give the markets the interest rate cut they had been clamoring for, gold rapidly rose to over $1,550 an ounce by September,” according to Milling-Stanley.

Gold futures reached $1,560 on September 4, marking the highest settlement price since April 2013.

The U.S. central bank cut interest rates three times in 2019, and then on Dec. 11 held its benchmark interest rate steady at a range of 1.5% and 1.75%.  
Between early 2001 to late 2010, gold prices increased from $250 an ounce to $1,250 per ounce. That’s an “average gain of $100 per year,” said Milling-Stanley.

He believes this was due “to increasing jewelry purchases throughout the emerging markets on the back of sustained good economic growth in the region.”

He noted that “speculative activity” drove prices up $500 in just nine months in 2011. As speculative interest decreased, gold prices fell back to $1,250 level in the spring of 2013. While Milling-Stanley is “hoping for modest, sustainable gains in gold over the coming years,” he is also “acutely conscious of the power the speculative community can have over gold in the short term.”

Milling-Stanley added: “I don’t believe the speculative community will want once again to risk missing the first 10 years of a bull market in gold, and the first $1,000 rise in the price, as it did at the beginning of this century.”  


Meanwhile, platinum was flat at $928.22, and silver increased slightly to 0.3% higher to $16.99.

Palladium’s bull run has been caused by a structural deficit, while platinum has been in a surplus, according to Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs.

  
“However, substitution of palladium for platinum is unlikely to happen until extreme physical shortages develop which create problems in producing automobiles to force the automakers to make expensive investments to make the switch.

Ive been investing for a while now, but I still consider myself a beginner. I recently convinced a friend to start investing. He asked me to help him build up his portfolio. Here is what he is looking for:

-He is ready to put in 3K USD 
-He doesn’t want his portfolio to be professionally managed (for now).
-Planning long term (buy and hold). He wants to see how the first three years go. So the goal is to be in the best position possible in this time frame.
-He is pretty conservative, looking to break even at worst.

Could you help me come up with some good stocks to start with. Here is what I’m am thinking so far:

- Go for tech and real estate
- Go for ETFs and maximize dividends through ETFs

**Oragenics (OGEN)**

\&gt;Oral Mucositis

Chemotherapy and radiation kill rapidly growing cells, including those in the mouth and hair. As a result, some cancer patients undergoing these treatments develop painful mouth sores and ulcers, called oral mucositis. Described to be the “most common complication for chemo/radiation therapy”, this indicates that the patient pool would virtually be anyone undergoing chemo/radiation therapy.  

\&gt;What is AG013

Stated to prevent Oral Mucositis (OM), this medication addresses an unmet need for those who undergo chemo/radiation therapy for head and neck cancers and suffer OM as a result as no drug has yet to be approved for this designation.  AG013 is OGEN's drug hopeful closest to approval. 

\&gt;Key findings in Phase 1b

In a Phase 1B clinical trial in 25 cancer patients with OM, AG013 was safe and well tolerated. Data published in the journal Cancer showed a 35% reduction of the duration of ulcerative OM in the AG013-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, close to 30% of the patients treated with AG013 were full responders while all placebo-treated patients developed ulcerative OM.  

From their September 30th ESMO presentation which showcases some of their Phase 2 results, it was revealed that incidence of Severe Oral Mucositis (SOM) was 47%, compared to the historical 70%. However, it should be noted that out of the initial 71 patients taking AG013, only 42 had “complete OM data” and thus, the results presented, while assuring, does not necessarily indicate certain success. 

\&gt;Drug Approval Status

AG013 received the FDA fast track designation and orphan drug status for the EU. Their primary endpoint is OM incidence rate and measurement in days of severe OM. The secondary end point is the number of OM-free days, time to onset, use of pain medication and alteration in cancer regimens. Topline Phase 2 results expected to be ready 1Q2020. 

\&gt; Competition and Comparisons

1. Amgen’s Kepivance \- FDA approved Kepivance for the treatment of oral mucositis in patients with blood cancers who are receiving intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by a stem cell (blood or bone marrow) transplant. OM severity 4 incidence was 20% compared to 62% for placebo. Severity 3-4 mucositis was reduced by approximately one-third – 63% versus 98% percent with placebo. Kepivance reduced the duration of painful OM, severity 2-4, to 8 days versus 14 days with placebo. While Kepivance differs from AG013 as it specifically treats OM related to blood cancers, it sets the bar for efficacy and safety that AG013 most likely has to meet.

2. Galera’s GC4419 – Phase 2B trials showed dose-dependent reduction, relative to placebo, of SOM incidence by 7.7% and 34% for 30mg and 90mg dosages respectively. Mean SOM duration was 24,8, 18.4 and 16.1 days for placebo, 30mg does and 90mg dose. Comparing placebo to 90mg does, there was a 35.1% reduction in mean SOM duration. Administration methods were intravenous using 250ml of saline solution over a period of 60 minutes. 

**Cash Burn Rate**

With $22.29m in cash available on its balance sheet and R&amp;D expenses of $9,360,520 and $4,178,294 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively (from 10-Q), OGEN has enough runway to operate through 2020 without the need to raise additional capital. However, I still believe that they would most likely raise more capital by dilutive new equity offerings after releasing (a hopefully successful) topline results in the first quarter of 2020. 

**Total Addressable Market**

A separate study, “Risk, Outcomes, and Costs of Radiation-Induced Oral Mucositis Among Patients With Head-and-Neck Malignancies”, evaluated 204 eligible patients and found that overall, “91% of patients developed OM”, of which 66% was severe (grade 3-4). Patients who received chemo-radio therapy were at significantly higher risk of developing OM (98%) while those receiving only radiotherapy had relatively lower risk (85%). The key takeaway is the high incidence of OM for cancer patients with oral cavity chemo/radiotherapy.  

The company estimates “peak share of 20-25%” with estimated cost of treatment $90/day for an average 70 days and 90% gross margin. An estimated 65,410 people (the addressable population) will develop head and neck cancer annually in the US.  Furthermore, assuming a conservative 55% of the addressable population undergoes chemo and/or radiation therapy, and the low end of market penetration, OGEN’s annual gross profit would be about USD 40.8 million. 

**Comments and Thoughts**

Similar to other small cap biotech stocks, their whole valuation hinges on FDA approval, subsequent market penetration and possible competition. With regards to the first issue, from their most recent Phase 1B trial, the efficacy of reducing OM incidence was similar to the already-approved Kepivance (30% vs 35% reduction). Duration of OM was also reduced, and its effectiveness was once again close to Kepivance’s. The same could be said when comparing AG013 and Galera’s GC4419. The standout issue is that AG013’s direct competitor, GC4419, has a shorter time to market. This would adversely affect market penetration. However, I believe that adoption of AG013 would be smoother than GC4419 due to the difference in their method of administration. GC4419 is administered intravenously over a 60-minute period while AG013 requires patients to simple rinse their mouths after every meal. It is not hard to see that most patients would choose AG013 over GC4419. 

With no currently existing treatment and superior administration method, I think that AG013’s value far outshines OGEN's current valuation. Even at 10% market penetration, it would bring in annual gross profit of USD20.4million, close to its current market cap.

**Catalyst dates and possible moves**

This stock is a high-risk play, OGEN only has one product that is anywhere close approval and thus it is not a stretch to say that its entire valuation rests on the progress of AG013. Despite this, I believe that the risk/reward of OGEN is worth it and would recommend allocating a small amount of capital to it (that you are willing to lose the entirety of) between now and before the release of its topline Phase 2 results in 1Q2020. However, in the event of a successful phase 2 results, I think there would most likely be another round of new equity offerings, which could dampen any gains for long-term investors.

**TLDR**

OGEN's AG013 has safety profile and efficacy close to the currently approved drug Kepivance. AG013 has one other competitor, GC4419, which I believe AG013 is superior to due to the differences in drug delivery. Using what I think are conservative estimates, I believe value of AG013 is much higher than OGEN's market cap.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,450369,public,self,"OGEN, a brief analysis",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/eal4q3/ogen_a_brief_analysis/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Value stocks (Thor Industries)**

**Thor Industries** ($THO) reported earnings on Monday with sales up 22% and gross margin improvement.  The sales increase was driven solely by the acquisition of Erwin Hymer Group in Europe but it was the news that dealer inventory rationalization is nearing completion that was the main reason to cheer. 

Dealers had built up stocks after years of strong demand. However a long winter in 2018 led to a drop in demand and dealers were left with an excess of inventory that is only now finally working its way through. That should lead to a return of growth in the near term while long term demand has been boosted by growing millennial demand from a new “experience” seeking generation. The stock remains down over 55% from its 2017 high and looks attractive on a PE of 12.8.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Stitch Fix,**  **Ciena Corporation, Ollies Bargain Outlet, Holdings Inc)** 

**Stitch Fix** ($SFIX) yet again brushes aside competition concerns with revenue growth of 21%, active client growth of 17% and growing revenue per active client by 10% year over year.

The stock price has gone nowhere in 2 years despite sales doubling and the company becoming profitable (just about). Compared to growth, the valuation of 1.34x current year revenue estimates looks cheap.

Competition, especially Amazon, remains a risk but Stitch Fix believes its algorithms give it an advantage and recent results support that thesis. Regardless there is room for more than one player, even Amazon. TAM estimated at $431 billion compared to $SFIX market capitalization of $2.6 billion.

Shares of **Ciena Corporation** ($CIEN) jumped 17% on Thursday after the manufacturer of high-speed networking systems reported an 8% rise in revenues and 9% rise in earnings. However it was comments by the CFO James E. Moylan that provided the real boost when he said the company was maintaining its target annual revenue growth rate of approximately 6% to 8% over the next three years and 20% adjusted EPS annual growth target over the next three years.  That’s a decent clip for a company valued on just 16x current year estimates.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ollie’s Bargain Outlet** shares rally 17% on Wednesday following strong Q3 results that beat expectations. Net sales increased 15.3%, operating income increased 22.0% and adjusted net income increased 28.3%. That’s an earnings beat of 5% compared to a miss of 24% in Q2 and should provide comfort to investors that the Ollie Bargain Outlet growth story remains on track.

Ollie’s had been a growth stock king until comp growth slowed in Q1 this year. However the wheels came off with the Q2 results in August when the company reported comps down 1.7%, earnings down 10% and full year guidance was reduced.

That was a set back for a company that had reported comp growth of 4.4% last year and has executed without issue since its IPO in 2015. However the company’s previously consistently strong track record leads me to take a favorable view of management’s explanations for the shortfall.

The company admits management made mistakes with poorly-timed inventory decisions that led to an excess of out of season goods and a shortage of in season goods. For example Ollie’s didn’t order in air conditioners ahead of the hot weather and by the time they arrived they had to be sold at a discount. That was a screw up that hit both sales and margins, that shouldn’t have happened and is not expected to happen again.

More generally logistics have been hit by the rapid growth of the company with an 18% increase in stores including 13 former Toys R Us locations that were generally larger than Ollie’s typical format. That has put a strain on sourcing and supplying stores and, with the company on the limit, some stores have been under stocked which has also impacted comp sales.

Finally, with several of the Toys R Us stores located near to existing Ollie’s stores there was an element of cannibalization of sales. That is unfortunate, and should have been foreseen, but there is almost no chance of that being repeated with the firms planned growth strategy which is pretty much into “white space” untouched territory.

However, even with recent difficulties, the company has reaffirmed full year guidance for a decent growth outlook (15% sales growth and 8% earnings growth).

Medium term, the potential for growth is remarkable. The company has 345 stores in 23 states and, after receiving third party research, believes it can increase its store count nationally to over 950.

The stock is trading at 35x revised guidance. That’s not cheap but it looks attractive. The bigger picture that we should not lose sight of is that off price retailers is the best sector to be in retail and that Ollie’s has a huge opportunity to grow its store count. Analysts forecast earnings growth of mid to high teens going forward. If Ollie’s can put the last two troublesome quarters behind it and restore its profit margins, that looks very achievable.

**Pharma (XBiotech)**

**XBiotech Inc's** ($XBIT) valuation jumped 75% this week to $816 million after agreement to sell antibody Bermekimab to Janssen. But that almost totally disregards $600 million of milestone payments

The company  has $40 million of cash, will receive cash upfront from JNJ (through its Janssen unit) of $750 million and potentially $600 million of milestone payments. Details on those payments are still vague but I doubt they are worthless;

""In addition, Janssen will be obligated to pay the Company up to four milestone payments of $150 million each, or a maximum of $600 million if it receives specified commercial authorizations within a specified timeframe for a pharmaceutical product that contains bermekimab and is for a non-dermatological indication.""

Bermekimab is an antibody that inhibits interleukin-1 alpha, which triggers inflammation that contributes to a wide range of diseases spanning cancer, autoimmune disorders, and type 2 diabetes. The enormous potential of the drug, 14 clinical programs in total, for non-dermatological indications was good enough for Janssen to pull the trigger.

I think both these operators are savvy enough to negotiate challenging but meaningful milestone payments.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insider buying (ClearOne)** 

Warning nano cap with market capitalization of just $32 million.

CEO and Chair of ClearOne, Zee Hakimoglu, picked up $45,000 of stock on Thursday and was joined by two directors Edward Bagly and Bruce Whaley. The purchase come after the company reported last month that a U.S. District Court had granted their request for a preliminary injunction to prevent Shure from manufacturing, marketing, and selling its competing ceiling microphone array in an infringing configuration. ClearOne released its beamforming microphone array in 2012 and the second generation in 2016, however the company has seen its revenues half over the past few years as it claims Shure has infringed its property rights. The ruling should help the company in its fight to win back those revenues.

I'm in 8th grade and we have a period where teachers choose a topic they like and teach about it (half the length of other periods). I am in one where we use the Investopedia simulator and are having a competition to see who can make the most out of the given $1,000,000. I have followed the stock market a bit for a while, but before we started the simulator we learned many of the basics. Currently, I just want advice on how good my (fake money) portfolio looks. Because I've only spent about 1/5 of my money so far, but everything is off by a bit, I can't really get percents. But I can give the general stats:

In total I've invested $202,334.20 of my million. I've made $2,255.14 total and the stocks I currently hold have made $1776.86 of that. I have

100 shares of AMZN (accounts for most of the money I've spent, will probably sell some of it soon)

50 shares of DG

50 shares of F

150 shares of IP

35 shares of CASY\*

15 shares of SCHL\*

20 shares of UL\*\*

10 shares of NGG\*\*

30 shares of WRK

15 shares of PEP

\* stocks that I got because quarterly earnings are coming out monday for those and I am hoping they'll improve and then I can sell (CASY might have released their report? I can't really tell)

\*\* stocks that I got of UK companies on the US exchanges because UK economy is doing better, I plan on keeping UL

I also made the other $500ish by buying lots of ADBE Wednesday, and selling it yesterday after they released their very positive quarterly reports. That's kind of my strategy for half of it, I plan on keeping everything without any asterisks (except some of the AMZN)

Any advice on good strategies or ways I could improve?

Investors have been waiting to see if new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would emerge by a Dec. 15 deadline and after the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged.   


# Spot gold was at $1,472 an ounce and U.S. gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,479.10.

“The slight fall in gold can be attributed to profit-taking after the Fed decided to keep rates on hold, but the change is minimal as investors are still cautious about what will happen

on Dec. 15,” said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler.  


The U.S. Fed’s benchmark overnight rate in its range between 1.50% and 1.75% three-quarters of a percentage point below where it started the year.   


“With the Fed possibly expanding the balance sheet again in 2020 … gold should be a regular feature in one’s asset allocation during periods of market uncertainty, especially when interest rates are low,” AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes noted.  


U.S. President Donald Trump met with top advisers on Thursday to discuss trade and the Dec. 15 deadline for new tariffs on nearly $160 billion worth of Chinese consumer goods, three sources familiar with the plans.  


According to Mitsubishi’s Butler, investors should look at gold as a longer term hold. Markets focused on the U.K. election which could lead to Britain’s departure from the European Union, and Christine Lagarde’s first meeting of the European Central Bank later in the day.   


Gold has long been considered a potential safe-haven investment during political and financial uncertainty.   


Palladium had increased 1% to $1,928.04 and has hit a record high of $1,931.50. The metal soared passed $1,900 for the first time in its history. Flooding in South Africa mines pushed the metal higher, as they triggered severe power blackouts and thus hindering production.   


“Even after the mines open in South Africa, palladium prices are not expected to correct much. It rather has a high potential to hit $2,000 soon,” Butler added.  


Platinum increased 0.3% to $941.89 while silver was little changed $16.88.

Gold had surged to a five-week high before selling off due to a tweet from President Trump. Gold futures were down $1.10 an ounce at $1,473.90 and March Comex silver prices were up $0.01 at $16.94 an ounce.   


Downbeat U.S. economic data is also bolstering gold’s outlook with jobless claims increasing more than forecast.   


Gold bulls cheered when the new European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde appeared dovish on ECB money policy, saying that it would continue its bond-buying program as long as it takes.   


President Trump then tweeted that the U.S. and China wanted a trade deal –– a positive sign that a partial trade deal could soon be completed.  


The FOMC meeting of the Federal Reserve meant no change in U.S. interest rates and a positive upbeat of the U.S. economy.   


The FOMC said there were no rate-cut plans planned for 2020, with most comments coming out of the meeting viewed as neutral.  


Gold and Treasury markets rallied, nonetheless, as the U.S. dollar index sold off and hit a five-week low in the aftermath of the FOMC statement Wednesday afternoon.

As the title says, I owned shares of a company, and this year they accepted a cash merger with larger company. Without any action by me (with my brokerage) I was paid an amount per share, and my shares disappeared.  just noticed this yesterday.

Can someone help me understand?

Say you have $100k invested in stocks. At the start of the year your portfolio was worth $100k and at the end of the year it is still worth $100k.

Throughout the year, you have made several short term trades. All the stocks that went up in value you already sold (cashed out), but all of the stocks that have gone down in value you are still holding on to in hopes that they go back up.

If my understanding is correct, this means that when December ends you will owe quite a bit of short-term capital gains taxes because your gains were all realized when you sold, but your losses (which would normally offset those gains) were never realized because you held on.

So why wouldn't you just, on December 30, sell all those stocks that are down, and then re-buy those stocks on the same day in order to realize your temporary losses for tax purposes for that year and still hold on to those stocks in case they do go back up?",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,450101,public,self,Why do people with unrealized losses not just sell and instantly re-buy their stocks that are down at the end of the year?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ea81tn/why_do_people_with_unrealized_losses_not_just/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just feel like filling the market with a bunch of new investors with barely any capital and not much experience and letting them buy partial shares with small amounts is just going to lead to a bad place.

I’m not trying to sound like a dick, I myself don’t have a lot of money to put in the market either but I just feel like these companies are making it seem like EVERYBODY needs to put their money in and that is not true.

Yeah you should contribute to your 401K/IRA which I guess.. kind of works the way of the fractional shares but its being managed by someone who gets compensated by how that fund works and has ways to manage that risk and you usually get a nice company match.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I've never posted to this sub, and I hope this post is appropriate. If it is not, will someone direct me to a different subreddit, that would be sweet. 

Anyways, 

My dad got very into trading and buying stocks this year, sort of as a hobby, nothing too crazy. I thought it would be a neat idea to get him a book related to stocks this year for Christmas. 

I do not want to get him anything boring or something that you'd expect to see a student reading. I was hoping to get something that has more of a narrative that also has stock related info within it. I don't want it to be a confusing or boring read, but I also do not want it to be like ""stocks for dummies"" type crap, something that is a nice in-between of stock terminology and narrative. 

Does anyone know of a book I should go with?  

I'm open to getting any of them!

Looking to see follow through on the move.  If it has some, we could see 32 by year end.  Volume has been decent on the day, but typically you want to see a heavy volume day to confirm the breakout.

Internet says the stock market has historically returned 10% a year over long term. Does this mean the stock price overall overtime goes up by an average of 10% yearly?
Do you think stocks continuously going up in price like this would make it hard to buy-in generations down the road? Or would new cheaper stocks come in and become the new go-to buys for everyone?
I guess the markets been going on for generations already and millions of people are still buying everyday. Just seems if stocks are past 1k per share it would be harder for people.?

Probably just thinking like this bc I dont have huge bank, was curious if anybody had any thoughts or had a strategy for these stocks that just keep going up and up.

Let's rewind to December of 2009. FB is not yet public. TWTR's tweets are still petite and the stock is unlisted. GOOG is back at $300 for the first time since its pre-recession peak. AAPL is also nearly back at $30, returning to pre-recession highs. MSFT is also at $30, where it has been stagnant since falling after its monopoly-esque problems. 

Fast forward to 2019. FB is at $200. TWTR is now listed and at $30, down from its IPO and recent highs near $45. GOOG is now at $1345. AAPL is $280. And MSFT is $151. Hot damn. Had you been holding since 12/2009, you would have made quite a return on any of these giants.

Internet consumption tripled from 50 minutes to 157 minutes from 2009 to 2019. TV dropped from 187 minutes to 163. 

But this major shift is IMO what is driving the internet boom. 

So what does this mean for 2030? What stocks should we pick now for 4-10X return in 10 years? 

I think the trend from 2009-2019 will continue through to 2029 even if the relative gains of internet consumption decrease. There is still XX time elsewhere to cannibalize, on TOP of 163 minutes of daily TV time. 

That internet time consumed by average person has tripled, and that the companies that benefit from this have more than tripled, belies the importance of media consumption and the tech revolution as we look forward to 2029. So to that end, what will still be around in 2029, what will be more consumed, what will be more profitable, and what will people be DOING more than today?

I think the 107 minute per day gain in media is going to hold over the next ten years re: internet use. As people have more free time in general due to the proliferation of the gig economy (tech insecurity = semi-unemployment / gig economy = media use in off time, besides increasing media use in general), FB, TWTR, GOOG are only going to become more engrained into society's everyday functioning. 

I am currently long on FB, and I think TWTR will be the next addition due to its recent drop. TWTR was tracking FB nicely post-2018 correction, and I believe the current price offers an entry target that is substantially undervalued. 

I see 2020 offering a major boon to both companies as election attention ramps up. TWTR will be a bigger name than ever this cycle as it plays out on the internet vs. TV more than any previous cycle (a trend that will only continue in 2024 and 2028). While concerns about FB's reach exist, I do not think they will result in a break-up as long as TWTR survives, as it removes the claims of monopoly. So TWTR's survival is actually also in FB's interest and as it survives it will only become more ubiquitous now that it is profitable. 

I think MSFT and AAPL and GOOG are probably great bets for 2029 as well, but I love FB and TWTR's potential over the next 10 years and would argue FB in particular could be like AAPL around 2009 in terms of impending growth. TWTR could be more of a GOOG. But both offer major return potential.

There is no so-called ‘phase-one’ deal in sight, and a U.S. central bank policy meeting could provide an outlook for 2020, causing either an increase or decrease in the price of gold.

Gold increased 0.43% to $1,470.25 per ounce, as gains extended into a third straight session. U.S. gold futures increased 0.47% higher to $1,475.0

In the latest events during a 17-month long trade war, U.S. President Donald Trump will decide this week whether or not to implement more tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese goods. Economic and trade advisors are expected to meet in coming days with Trump over the final decision, a source told Reuters.

“Gold has been up because of the uncertainty of the trade talks, along with the FOMC meeting this afternoon,” said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.

The Fed is not expected to change the rates much and neither is the European Central Bank in its Thursday meeting regarding that bank’s rates.

“The global economy appears to have stabilized after a year of growth uncertainty. If yields on U.S. 10 (Treasury) yields rise above 1.90%, we think that will signal the end of golds rally and push prices below $1,400/oz,” analysts at OCBC bank said in a note.

Meanwhile, palladium continues to break records, increasing 0.6% to $1,907.70 per ounce. Mine shutdowns in South Africa due to blackouts caused by flash flooding has also led to supply concerns. Palladium should enjoy its 14th straight session of price increase.

“South Africa produces 40% of world’s palladium and the ESKOM outages are hitting some mines, giving palladium just that extra nudge above $1,900,” said Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO. “We’ve now had 13 consecutive positive sessions, which seems a little rich, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see some consolidation, though the overall trend continues to look quite positive.”

“Gold is riding higher on dollar weakness and caution ahead of a looming tariff deadline,” said FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga. He believes tariffs could lead to gold gains, though the Wall Street Journal reported analysts expect the tariffs to be delayed. 

“In the short-term, if the Fed shifts to a more hawkish assessment, gold is at risk from further repositioning. Technically this could pull prices back to $1,410/oz,” UBS analysts noted.

Goldman Sachs remains bullish on the yellow metal.  


Since then, as the S&amp;P 500 increased more than 10 percentage points, the gold price declined 7 percentage points over the same period, for an increase of 17% on the year. Despite the pullback, Goldman is still bullish.  


“Gold’s strategic case is still strong,” Goldman Sachs ’ Mikhail Sprogis, precious metals analyst at Goldman, wrote in a note to clients. “We expect ‘Fear’-driven investment demand for gold to be supported by late cycle concerns, political uncertainty and high \[developing market\] household savings.”  


He highlighted how interest rates remain historically low, suggesting this is a bullish sign for gold, since there is a limited chance of bond prices rising, which could send investors to safehaven investments like gold.   


Like Deutsche Bank, he believes “more widespread discussions of \[Modern Monetary Theory\] could lead to greater demand for gold on debasement concerns.”  


Another reason for increased gold demand is increasing popularity of Modern Monetary Theory, MMT, which suggests national debt is not a constraint on countries. Bernie Sanders-advisor and economist Stephanie Kelton subscribes to this theory, as does Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

Fiscal concerns around national debt are unfounded, proponents suggest, as long as inflation remains low. They suggest low rates should be taken advantage of in order to fund infrastructure and social programs to boost growth and reduce inequality.  


“In the next recession, our US economists do not expect governments to adopt direct monetary financing and expect inflation to remain firmly anchored,” Sprogis wrote. “But this doesn’t necessarily prevent an increase in debasement concerns if conversations around MMT become more widespread — a potential boost to demand for gold as a debasement hedge.”  


Goldman’s 12-month target for gold of $1,600 per ounce calls for an 8.5% gain from Monday’s opening price. In the past 12 months, gold has increased nearly 14%. Continuing political uncertainty could increase demand for gold.  


“High political uncertainty due to continued trade tensions and the approaching US elections should also be supportive gold in 2020,” Sprogis wrote. “This uncertainty may be one of the reasons why we see evidence of a non-ETF vaulted gold build, as high net worth individuals may want to store gold outside the financial system.”

(iii) why they might be acquired by the potential suitors. 

Here’s couple of my speculation:

- Docusign (DOCU) to be acquired by Salesforce (CRM) - Almost all workflows supported by CRM could technically have a touchpoint for document/content generation and signature. It wouldn’t be an illogical acquisition to make. Additionally, CRM have mandated themselves for continuous double digit growth in coming years which won’t be possible just organically.

- XILINX (XLNX) to be acquired by Qualcomm (QCOM) or Broadcom (AVGO) - As Qualcomm will need to continue to look for alternate revenue sources as Apple will eventually not need them, XLNX being a mid sized company, compared to QCOM, could be a good target.

Over the years he has challenged cross Atlantic shipping records and round the world balloon races.  Coincidentally, his latest venture into space seems to be a vehicle that is just as useful for promotion as it is for extra-terrestrial propulsion.

However he has now been joined by some brave analysts who have been attempting to forecast the future of space travel in 2040.  That has generated a lot of publicity for the analysts as well as Mr Branson’s company.  

The attention has also created a boost for the stock price that had been retreating since last month’s IPO.  However, I suspect that the pull of gravity will shortly return and that any gains will be short lived.

I may be wrong.  Maybe Virgin Galactic will take a 40% share of the $800 billion 2040 inter continental space travel industry and generate 10% net margins.  If so (assuming a future PE of 15) then the stock should be valued today at closer to $80 billion rather than its current $1.8 billion market capitalization.  An even higher valuation of $480 billion in 2040 would be possible.

That offers an attractive return but one that should be considered carefully along with the likelihood of set-backs and cost overruns (over the next twenty years), the risk of disaster and the certainty of competition.

I was curious about this because I was reading about Brian Chesky a while back and was confused because he had a net worth of 3.8 ~ 4.2 billion in 2019, as calculated by Forbes, but Airbnb isn't public. He also seemed to not have any other sources of income that would be able to generate billions worth of assets. Even Elizabeth Holmes had an officially recognized net worth of 5.9 billion dollars but Theranos was never public, does that mean that her private equity holdings in the company were counted - since her net worth dropped to zero after the company was formally dissolved. For several days now I have tried to find an answer to this, but could not find a direct solution online.

Also, if the answer is yes then who decides what your holdings are worth? Does Forbes have a list of verified investment bankers and business evaluators to calculate your net worth? 

And if you have a 60% profit margin with a steady growth rate then what amount of revenue, in the millions or hundred of millions, do you personally believe would give your business a billion dollar valuation?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Disney+ being released was certainly not priced in. The stock jumped on the news release, but slowly tumbled down. Until we see how profitable this venture is to the bottom line, how can you make the assumption anything is priced in?

1. 15% electronics tarif will go in affect on Sunday night if no deal is achieved or if trump doesn’t push them. This will kill bestbuy, Apple ,...etc 

2. Fedex is tied to trade significantly. Every time China is mentioned this past  year the stock moves( 2-6%). Last quarter the cut guidance down due to trade tensions and stock went from 175  ( which was recovering ) to 139 huge L this means that the bar is low. If they do raise guidance expect the stock to move up bigely  

3. It seems like news is mixed on the deal. A bit more optimistic. My opinion is trump needs the deal be re-elected. However this is only phase one. I am worried he might  not push tarifs since job report last week was great and consumer spending is high. On the other hand pushing the tariffs will be positive news specifically for fedex it will also help trump have one less war to fight on the world stage ( he has France , China , Brazil all trade ) impeachment internally 

4. Online spending is sky rocketing this means returns will be high both of which will reflect positively for shipping. 

5. Most of the retailers (target , bestbuy and Macy’s ) shipped in UPS while few were fedex (Walmart) 

6. Fedex has strong flight shipping vs ups focuses on ground so maybe they have a partnership on some routes that I am kissing. I reached out to friends in Texas, Chicago and Minneapolis  same companies used same carrier( UPS) keep in mind this isn’t a big sample size to determine the population at all ) 

7. Fedex had a huge job shortage because of the holiday season. They had to hire somewhere around 10,0000 additional sorters . It reached a point where they had bus people accords state lines to their main facility

PG&amp;E officially stated that moving forward they would be shutting down the power even more frequently, as a precaution, against high wind or dry conditions that may risk another major fire. So unfortunately, this is more sad news for Californian businesses and residents who are dreading the blackout days ... but it doesn’t have to be a painful experience for them and for PG&amp;E, thanks to Bloom Energy and it’s micro grid power generation solution.  


I don’t expect California’s critical infrastructure like hospitals, stores, schools, offices, data centers, factories and even day to day residents wanting to go back to the 18th century ..living in darkness and without water ( and toilet flushes)..risking their peace of mind, lives and business revenues  ( note: if you are living in those areas affected by the PG&amp;E wild fires - my sincere sympathies..please do comment how you feel about the power cuts..) !!!

Given that another major fire incident will be a kiss of death for $PCG stock value and for its management — $BE’s fuel cell microgrid power generation (its like a mini PG&amp;E on-demand power plant to meet power needs locally) is ripe for an immediate and sustainable solution to power this critical infrastructure . The Bloom Energy fuel cell microgrid power generation solution is much cheaper, safer and cleaner than installing traditional generating sets ( with traditional generators and turbines - mechanical efficiency is much lower, and green house gas and particulate emissions are much higher polluting communities near these traditional power generating sites..and by the way not everyone can afford and maintain a traditional generator ...thankfully no such issues for Bloom’s fuel cell sites, and existing local grid infrastructure cn be used to distribute the power to everyone ).

Solar and Wind power may have an important role to play but these are a part of the solution with $BE fuel cell generation ( powered by natural gas or methane generated from community or farm waste sites) ..  
Solar and Wind power sources can’t work alone all by themselves.. solar and wind source intensity changes daily and seasonably, requiring a Battery to store their power or to pump back the power in a grid..  
There is no such Battery of that size in the world today (and not expected at least for the next 5-10 years) - that can power this critical infrastructure load (peak load and  average load) for hours and days!!! ...the largest battery for such utility-level use is has been attempted by Tesla and it is only used to balance the peak loads for just a few seconds (balancing peak power loads variation) !  


In conclusion, I expect a huge order pipeline for $BE fuel cells in 2020 &amp; beyond from California and many other states across the US ( and for that matter , I am bullish on micro grid sector as a whole ) ..Other long term trends include increasing % of EV's that will add loads on the electrical grids..  


As Utilities and their boards wake up to these expensive risks (as PG&amp;E did , and it is just a start as you will see other state utilities coming up with resiliency plans) , and State &amp; Local Politicians better understand that they will be voted out of “power” if their voting district residents are “out of power” (NY legislators recently allowed propane pipeline for Long Island) — the logical need for $BE products and services will only go up...and its investors, clients (and planet - BE servers can use Methane from waste sites and capture harmful emissions) will be handsomely rewarded !!  


( BTW: In my view - and I am long on $BE, the $BE stock is severely under-priced at this time due to the sellers activity...but short sellers no matter how smart did not foresee three things: 1. California wildfires reaction from its hard working communities and others including ""media"" who supported them  - as evidenced by PG&amp;E's settlement today, 2. the ""sensible"" green energy talk in US Presidential election cycle and topic of Climate Change back on the worldwide stage,  3. intensity of the regulatory changes propelling Bloom servers installations and other clean energies sources..as politicians have to make rapid practical decisions if they don't want to risk losing their next election)

&gt; Google announced its intentions to acquire Fitbit on Nov. 1 for about $2.1 billion in cash, or $7.35 per share. Facebook views the sale process as complete and doesn't plan to bid again now that Google has agreed to the purchase, one of the people said.

&gt; According to the filing, Fitbit CEO James Park had dinner with ""the chief executive officer of Party A"" on June 11, 2019, to discuss the wearables technology landscape. That person would be Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, sources said. Park and other members of Fitbit's senior management had dinner with Zuckerberg again on July 2, the filing said. Zuckerberg and Park met once more in September, according to the filing.

I know I'm unlikely to beat the market but it's fun and all. I'm not actively trading, just doing a few hours of research each week and buying positions in stocks that seem to be undervalued and planning to hold for the long term.

I've found that when I initiate a position in a stock that stays flats or goes down it doesn't bother me too much. I bought the stock because I felt it was undervalued in the short-term and a good value to buy. So assuming there hasn't been a structural change to my investment thesis (which I'm trying to review about quarterly), I just shrug and DCA downwards thinking I get to pick up more shares at an even better discount.

On the other hand when the stocks goes up, DCAing feels bad because I'm not getting as good of value as the position I've already entered. Psychologically I don't like seeing my overall cost basis going up. Plus I know I'm not smart enough to be picking *exact* values of any of these stocks so who's to say whether my thesis has played out?

So for example when I'm down 15% on $WMB I add to that position, but when I'm up 40% on CVS I just hold that position. Stepping back from that it feels wrong to be doubling down on the losers and leaving the winners untouched - you'd probably want to do the opposite.

&gt;Prior to their merger closing last week, both CBS and Viacom had suspended their buyback programs, Bakish said. But a roughly $2.5 billion buyback program for which CBS had been granted previous authorization will be restarted, he said.

Couple interesting happening:   
**UK Election, Fed Meeting, and US Trade Decision.**

&amp;#x200B;

I think it'll be a fun and volatile week.

In the background, there are ongoing global protests, there's the impeachment inquiry, and there's Rocketman. You also have very high government and student debt - and more recently, record levels of corporate and household debt.

The yield curve inversion has mostly been forgotten about and is now very uncool - but prior to the last few recessions, the curve inverted and the un-inverted a few months before the actual recession hit. The S&amp;P500 has gone up 5% since the September before the yield curve scare. 5% is not bad - 5% would double your money every 15 years, and it beats inflation. And that's measuring from the peak. We are up +30% from the lows.

There's been a bunch of shitty IPOs recently - large investment firms like SoftBank are losing their prestige while others like Berkshire are finding it hard to find a good reason to spend money. Sketchy stuff is starting to become a little more common - i.e. the infinite money glitch, 'House-Hacking' out of college, internet/catfishing/phone scams, commission-free stock betting, e-coin trading, etc. All of these I've seen mentioned as signs we are at 'late-stage'

Negative yields are still a bit of a mystery. QE (or 'Not-QE'?) has been brought back and is here to stay. The Fed probably won't cut or hike at this next meeting, but markets think that there will be cut in 2020 - which isn't a great sign for the economy. Especially since, isn't QE supposed to end mid-2020? Every time the Fed has cut more than 75 basis points at a stretch, the economy ended up going into a recession.

Do any of these affect a companies stock price directly? Maybe not - but I think if markets do take a hit this week, and you're left holding the bag, you'll look pretty silly given all these 'indicators'. Especially if you're one of the lucky few who has seen the value of your investment rise 100% since the 2008 highs, or 400% from the 2009 lows and you're still pushing for more. We are at all-time highs, in a trade war with a country that just banned the use of foreign technology in their government offices.

I wanted to gather some thoughts on Humana Healthcare. Recently they have been climbing greatly and have hit a 52 week high. I hold a fair amount of shares (from the past few years) and am a little torn on whether or not to sell.

In 2020, all healthcare insurance providers will need to pay the health insurance tax (H.I.T) part of Affordable Care Act. This new tax will be used to supposedly lower premiums for Affordable Care plans. Each major health care company will pay their market share and Humana is slated for about $1B.

I’ve been lurking on this forum for years. I am 28 years old making $64,000 as of right now. I currently put 5% into 401k and 5% into Roth IRA and my employer matches 4% each. 18% of my income is currently going into retirement. I have a low debt ratio, once all of the bills are paid including money into savings, I have $200 that I’d like to invest biweekly.

For my current 401k/Roth IRA, future I'll need to change - In 3 years, my annualized rate of return is 10.25% and my cumulative is at 29.77%. Would you go for a target fund retirement or only invest 100% in one thing?

25% Vanguard Small Cap Index Adm VSMAX

25% Vanguard Mid Cap Index Admiral VIMAX

50% Vanguard Large Cap Index Admiral VLCAX

I have a brokerage account which I am considering putting a percent for long term either ETF XNTK or VTI for 15-20 years. XNTK expense ratio is 0.35%. VTI has 0.3% expense ratio. I’m leaning towards VTI. Which one would you do Outside of that ETF I have been thinking about the rest playing with stocks if the market crashes 2020 that’s when I’ll buy in, which my mindset is buy/hold then sell once it gets to 4-8% gain increase.

For the actively managed funds I plan to zone in on some industry sectors that I think will do well in the future, and pick funds depending on fees/structure/what shares they own etc.

Now, I'm not feeling confident enough to trade in stocks myself, but I have a gut feeling about some stocks that I think will grow over time. Say for example that I like Coca-Cola, and would like to invest in a fund that owns Coca-Cola shares.

For the time being I have scrolled through lists of funds and looked at what stocks they own. Would it be possible to reverse the search, i.e. searching for ""Coca-Cola"" and find all investment funds that own Coca-Cola shares? I realize that the point of actively managed funds is for the manager to switch up the portfolio when they see fit, but try to humor this question nonetheless!

Hopefully my question is clear – English isn't my first language so it's possible the finance terminology doesn't translate right.

Im 29 y/o my company provides a 401k plan for retirement and I also have an IRA.I set a budget and usually stick to it. When I get my paycheck I set a side money for bills, put 30% of my paycheck to savings and set aside pocket money just for everyday use. End of each month I ended up having a few hundred remaining which I fell into the habit of buying stuff on amazon that I want (not need) that I use for a bit and then just put it in a box. So I decided to try to get smart about it and instead of blowing it on useless stuff online I decided to try to develop an additional revenue stream. 

My goal is to invest this extra money each month into dividend paying stocks. So I can slowly but surely stop having to invest my own money into buying stocks and be able to use the dividends that I earn to reinvest. Eventually creating a second ""paycheck"" in case I fall on hard times or just keep reinvesting into securities to keep it growing when business is good and even eventually when I retire live off social security ( if its still around) , my 401k, IRA and these dividends.

I am fully aware that for me to reach my goal of getting decent sized payments when dividends are paid will take many years and I am ok with that. 

To summarize I have a 10 year goal of additional monthly income &amp; a 30ish year goal of additional retirement benefits added to what I already have.  

Currently, 

I have a pretty diversified portfolio with only dividend paying securities. I have a portion of my portfolio invested in penny stocks with very high paying dividends (11-18%) , blue chip stocks like AT&amp;T, Ford , Pfizer and many others that usually pay (3-7%) dividends, ADRs like Honda ( 3ish %) and REITs ( pay monthly dividends 9-11%). 

I am not heavily invested into any one security and I never invest any sum of money that would hurt if tomorrow I lost all my principal(it would suck and might emotionally break me but wouldn't effect my finances and current life style). I do have alerts set up on my phone to notify me if any of the stocks that I own drop below a certain value that would make me uncomfortable owning. Plus out of those few hundred (200-300) that I use to trade each month about 30% of it I put in my brokerage account but dont invest it. I keep it to invest in dividend paying blue chip stocks when a recession hits and stock prices drop in the hopes of when we enter recovery they stock value will grow and I will get higher % of return from the dividends. The only risk I am personally seeing is with my some of my more higher paying dividend stocks is volatility which is acceptable for me  because of the bigger returns.I dont really want to do any short term trades like buying stock ""x"" @ $25 and selling it a few weeks later @ 36 as I would have to manage my investments 100x more actively. Even tho it would probably make me more $ short term I dont have the time to actively manage anything.  

As my career grows and and my income increases I my monthly surplus will increase proportionately as well so I can invest more until it starts paying for itself.

So thats basically where I am at 

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for my strategy or advice. Ill even take any suggestions anyone has on any decent dividend paying securities . Right now I am looking into municipal and govt bonds since the safety and annual returns are appealing. Even though I do hold securities that are slightly risky I would prefer a relatively stable stock with decent dividends. Capital appreciation is a benefit but not my main goal for me 1st goal is liquid income , 2nd is stability 3rd is growth.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,447792,public,self,need advice for my investment strategy and stocks,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/e7r64i/need_advice_for_my_investment_strategy_and_stocks/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Years ago this company was acquired a few years ago by GE and a new subsidiary was created.

Enter Compushare, a business designed to manage merging of stock, distributing dividend checks, among other things for big corporations. Compushare runs this scam where they get a list of all the many thousands of small minority around the nation like me, and they send a letter informing us that we each must pay Compushare $300 or give up 10% of our stock (whichever is a greater dollar value). Compushare declares if we do not pay them then:

A) They will withhold any future dividend checks and

B) We cannot sell or transfer our stock.

My dividends would be around 100 a year spread across four checks, and I have been in a stalemate with Compushare for about five years now, meaning they owe me about $500 just in dividends, not to mention my stock.

Fast forward to today and I received a thin envelope in the mail from Compushare. Upon opening the envelope I find a 1099-DIV form assigning me responsibility for the taxes on the dividends Compushare refuses to pay me. Compushare is obviously doing a few things wrong and I am guessing class actionable / illegal running afoul of the IRS.

1) Compushare is obviously earning funds for themselves using the dividends of many people across the USA and world (Compushare is global)

2) They are lying to the IRS about taxes on these fund by claiming the people who should be are own the tax liability, even though Compushare is keeping the money for themselves.

When you multiply this scam by the vast number or corporation doing business with Compushare both with stock certificate management and dividends, it seems like Compushare is scamming huge amounts of money, but they are able to get away with it because they only do scam small share holders who individually wield no power.

I am a 29 year old and for the last few years I have been putting my savings into a fund (a UK bank fund) and the returns over that time has been just shy of 5%. I am thinking of investing in individual companies now and was looking for some advice. My time frame is 5-10 years. Now the stocks I want to invest in some are not very popular. I was thinking of investing in the following:

\*Uber $20K (Uber is not going anywhere imo and I just don't see how this company can fail given that it's become so ubiquitous. It also has first mover advantage. Once they stop concentrating on expansion I think they have a good chance at profitability)

\*TWTR $10K (Would I get shouted at if I said this is like a utility company? It has become part of everyday life and is used by politicians and all the way down to the common man. You want live news. This is the closest you can get to that.)

\*VRTX $10K (produce the only drug that directly treats cystic fibrosis itself. This could be a huge profit driver)

\*VISA $10K (contactless payments are on the way up and society is going towards cashless transactions)

I am open to ideas and if this seems stupid do tell. I have a good job and an emergency fund should I need it. I want to start investing now so I can be comfortable when I am an old man iA.

According to Netflix, their churn rate, i.e. people unsubscribing, is around 9% per quarter. Using this, one can calculate the total churn, the gross added subscriptions as well as the net added subscriptions. CAC (customer acquistion cost) is calulated by dividing marketing spend by gross added subscriptions, netCAC by dividing marketing spend by net added subscriptions. Numbers in thousands, apart from CAC and netCAC. 

&amp;#x200B;

||Q1 2018|Q2 2018|Q3 2018|Q4 2018|Q1 2019|Q2 2019|Q3 2019|

|Marketing|$250.719|$251.298|$210.595|$312.739|$221.046|$250.606|$211.793|
|Churn|4.958|5.036|5.126|5.264|5.421|5.409|5.456|
|Gross add|7.030|5.830|6.034|6.655|7.007|5.295|5.926|
|Net add|2.277|872|998|1.529|1.743|(126)|517|
|CAC|$35.66|$43.11|$34.90|$46.99|$31.55|$47.33|$35.74|
|netCAC|$110.11|$288.19|$211.02|$204.54|$126.82|($1988.94)|$409.66|

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, CAC has only risen marginally. netCAC however - which is the important metric - has reached enormous levels. The marginal cost of adding one additional subscriber is nearly $410 - equal to more than 16 quarters of average revenue (\~$25). So right now it takes more than 16 quarters for a new user to just recoup the marketing spend. 

The outlook: Netflix own estimates for total domestic subscriptions is 61.220.000 - that is adding 600.000 new subscribers in Q4. They also stated that marketing spend will be more weighted towards the fourth quarter. Let's just assume a lower bound of $312 million - which would be the same spend as in Q4 2018. In reality, marketing spend should be closer to $400 million, thanks to new competitors (Apple TV, Disney+, NBCUniversal's Peacock...). But numbers are already disastrous with the lower bound. $312 million for 600 thousand new subscriptions is around $520 per effective new subscriber. That is more than 20 quarters - or five years. 

These numbers are unsustainable. Effectively, Netflix has reached its peak user baser in the US. There are around 129 million households in the US. Nearly 50% have a Netflix subscription (probably even more, if you consider shared accounts). There is just no one left who would still become a new Netflix subscriber. 

At the same time, new competitors enter the ring (as mentioned above). Which means, that the churn rate might rise a little bit. Maybe up to 10%, maybe even 12%. More importantly though: the users who decide for a subscription service have a choice now. Disney+ is only $7 a month. And they've spent the last two years acquiring licenses for all time classic movies and series. This makes them a lot more attractive than Netflix. 

Some people might even consider Apple TV - others have Amazon Prime Video. There is also Hulu, HBO Go and NBCUniversal's Peacock. What all of those companies have in common: They are not solely reliant on streaming as a source of revenue. Apple and Amazon have pockets deeper than the Mariana trench. Netflix doesn't. In fact, Netflix burns around $3.5 billion dollars of cash this year. And the year before. They have amassed more than $32 billion in debt. Financed through junk bonds. Just in 2019, their interest payments will be more than $600 million. Those numbers are rising dramatically. Unless they raise new capital...

Netflix uses the cash to produce new content. All kinds of movies and series. But here is the trap: In the moment they stop, people will unsubscribe. They do not have the same library depth anymore. I remember when I could watch ""The Godfather"" on Netflix (I am located in Germany). Not anymore. Same with other favourite movies of mine. So all Netflix has remaining, are their own productions. And so they have to produce and produce and produce more shows - while prices for production increase and they suddenly have to share the market with more players. 

Internationalisation does not help much, since different cultures prefer different content. Series like ""Casa de papel"" which cater to an international audience are rare. So what should Netflix do? Continue their content-producing spending spree, getting more and more into debt? What if interest rates rise and suddenly they have to pay 8% or more? 

Their latest issued bond is already at 6.375%:

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/netflix\_incdl-notes\_201919-29-bond-2029-us64110lax47](https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/netflix_incdl-notes_201919-29-bond-2029-us64110lax47)

So that means they have to stop spending so much on production and marketing. Unfortunately though, that would make people leave the platform even quicker. Also, they would lack arguments as to why people should subscribe in the first place. 

Lastly, international growth will not help to ease the pressure. Each market wants their own series and movies. New markets are more expensive. And there will hardly be a market with similarly high revenue per subscription as the US. 

While I am positive that Netflix will find its way - $150 billion market valuation is just 70% too much for a company that stopped growing in its most important market and burns $3.5 billion in cash every year. Financed by more and more expensive junk bonds and trapped in a ""damned if you do, damned if you do"" situation, there is really no basis whatsoever for a valuation as right now.

# **What Trump does before trade deadline is the ‘wild card’ that will drive markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/what-trump-does-before-trade-deadline-is-the-wild-card-that-will-drive-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Trump administration’s Dec. 15 deadline for new tariffs on China looms large, and while most strategists expect them to be delayed while talks continue, they don’t rule out the unexpected.
*****
&gt; “That’s the biggest thing in the room next week. I don’t think he’s going to raise them. I think they’ll find a reason,” said James Pauslen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. But Paulsen said President Donald Trump’s unpredictable nature makes it really impossible to tell what will happen as the deadline nears.
*****
&gt; “He’s the one off you’re never sure about. It’s not just tariffs. It could be damn near anything,” Paulsen said. “I think he goes out of his way to be a wild card.”
*****
&gt; Just in the past week, Trump said he would put new tariffs on Brazil, Argentina and France. He rattled markets when he said he could wait until after the election for a trade deal with China.
*****
&gt; Once dubbing himself “tariff man,” Trump reminded markets that he sees tariffs as a way of getting what he wants from an opponent, and traders were reminded tariffs may be around for a long time.
*****
&gt; Trade certainly could be the most important event for markets in the week ahead, which also includes a Fed interest rate decision Wednesday and the U.K.’s election that could set the course for Brexit. If there’s no China deal, that could beat up stocks, send Treasury yields lower and send investors into other safe havens.
*****
&gt; When Fed officials meet this week, they are not expected to change interest rates, but they are likely to discuss whether they believe their repo operations to drive liquidity in the short-term funding market are running smoothly, ahead of year end. Economic reports in the coming week include CPI inflation Wednesday, which could be an important input for the Fed.
*****
&gt; Punt, but no deal
&gt; As of Friday, the White House did not appear any closer to striking a deal with China, though officials say talks are going fine. Back in August, Trump said if there is no deal, Dec. 15 is the date for a new wave of tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese goods, including cell phones, toys and lap top computers.
*****
&gt; Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas, said it seems like a low probability there will be a deal in the coming week. “What the market is focused on right now is whether there’s going to be tariffs that to into effect on Dec. 15, or not. It’s being rated pretty binary,” said Clifton. “I think what’s happening here and the actions by China overnight looks like we’re setting up for a kick.”
*****
&gt; China removed some tariffs from U.S. agricultural products Friday, and administration officials have been talking about discussions going fine.
*****
&gt; Clifton said if tariffs are put on hold, it’s unclear for how long. “Those are going to be larger questions that have to be answered. This is really now about politics. Is it a better idea for the president to cut a deal without major structural reforms, or should he walk away? That’s the larger debate that has to happen after Dec. 15,” Clifton said. “I’m getting worried that some in the administration... they’re leaning toward no deal category.”
*****
&gt; Clifton said Trump’s approval rating falls when the trade wars heat up, so that may motivate him to complete the deal with China even if he doesn’t get everything he wants.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, director of rates strategy at Wells Fargo, said his base case is for a trade deal to be signed in the next couple of months, but even so, he said he can’t entirely rule out another outcome. It would make sense for tariffs to be put on hold while talks continue.
*****
&gt; “The tweeter-in-chief controls that one, ” said Schumacher. “That’s anybody’s guess...I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he suspends it for a few weeks. If he doesn’t, that’s a pretty unpleasant result. That’s risk off. That’s pretty clear.”
*****
&gt; Because the next group of tariffs would be on consumer goods, economists fear they could hit the economy through the consumer, the strongest and largest engine behind economic growth.
*****
&gt; Fed ahead
&gt; The Fed has moved to the sidelines and says it is monitoring economic data before deciding its next move. Friday’s strong November jobs report, with 266,000 jobs added, reinforces the Fed’s decision to move to neutral for now.
*****
&gt; So the most important headlines from its meeting this week could be about the repo market, basically the plumbing for the financial system where financial institutions fund themselves. Interest rates in that somewhat obscure market spiked in September. Market pros said the issue was a cash crunch in the short term lending market, made better when the Fed started repo operations.
*****
&gt; The Fed now has multiple operations running over year end, and Schumacher said it has latitude to do more. Strategists expect there to be more pressure on the repo market as banks rein in operations to spruce up their balance sheets at year end.
*****
&gt; “No one is going to come to the Fed and say you did too much in the year-end funding,” said Schumacher. “If repo happens to spike somewhat on one day, the Fed is going to hammer it the next day.”
*****
&gt; Paulsen said the markets will be attuned to this week’s inflation numbers. Consumer inflation, the CPI is reported on Wednesday and producer prices are Thursday.
*****
&gt; A pickup in inflation of any significance is one thing that could pull the Fed from the sidelines, and prod it to consider a rate hike.
*****
&gt; “I think the inflation reports might start to get a little attention. Given the jobs numbers, the employment rate, growth picking up a little bit and a better tone in manufacturing. I do think if you get some hot CPI number, I don’t know if the Fed can ignore it,” he said. “Core CPI is 2.3%.” He said it would get noticed if it jumped to 2.5% or better.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s inflation target is 2% but its preferred measure is the PCE inflation, and that remains under 2%.
*****
&gt; Stocks were sharply higher Friday but ended the past week flattish. The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher, up 0.2% at 3,145, and the Dow was down 0.1% at 28,015. The Nasdaq was 0.1% lower, ending the week at 8,656.

# Reasons We Still Believe In December

&gt; It has been a rough start to the most wonderful month of them all, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down each of the first two days of December. Don’t stop believing just yet, though.

&gt; Everyone knows December has usually been a good month for stocks, but what happened last year is still fresh in the minds of many investors. The S&amp;P 500 fell 9.1% in December 2018 for the worst December since 1931. That sounds really bad, until you realize stocks fell 30% in September 1931, but we digress.

&gt; One major difference between now and last year is how well the global equities have been performing. Heading into December 2018, the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% year to date, but markets outside of the United States were already firmly in the red, with many down double digits.

&gt; “We don’t think stocks are on the verge of another massive December sell off,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “If my Cincinnati Bengals can win a game, anything is possible. However, we are quite encouraged by the overall participation we are seeing from various global stock markets this year versus last year, when the United States was about the only market in the green heading into December.”

&gt; Stocks have also overcome volatile starts to December recently. The S&amp;P 500 was down four days in a row to start 2013 and 2017, but the gauge still managed to gain 2.4% and 1%, respectively, in those years.

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, December has been the second-best month of the year for stocks going back to 1950. It is worth noting that it was the best month of the year before last year’s massive drop. Stocks have historically been strong in pre-election years as well, and December has never been lower two times in a row during a pre-election year. Given stocks fell in December 2015, bulls could be smiling when this month is wrapped up.

# Could Impeachment Be Good for Investors?

&gt; Impeaching a President with the possibility of removal from office is by no means great for the country. However, it may not be so horrible for the stock market or investors if history is any guide. We first touched on this over two years ago here on the blog and now that much has transpired and the US House of Representatives is now proceeding with drafting articles of impeachment we figured it was a good time to revisit the history (albeit limited) of market behavior during presidential impeachment proceedings. The three charts below really tell the story.

&gt; During the Watergate scandal of Nixon’s second term the market suffered a major bear market from January 1973 to October/December 1974 with the Dow down 45.1%, S&amp;P 500 down 48.2% and NASDAQ down 59.9%. Sure there were other factors that contributed to the bear market such as the Oil Embargo, Arab-Israeli War, collapse of the Bretton Woods system, high inflation and Watergate. However, shortly after Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 the market reached the secular bear market low on October 3 for S&amp;P and NASDAQ and December 6 for the Dow.

&gt; Leading up to the Clinton investigations and through his subsequent impeachment and the acquittal by the Senate the market was on a tear as one of the biggest bull markets in history raged on. After the 1994 midterm elections when the Republicans took back control of both houses of Congress the market remained on a 45 degree upward trajectory except for a few blips and the shortest bear market on record that lasted 45 days and bottomed on August 31, 1998.

&gt; Clinton was impeached in December 1998 and acquitted in February 1999 as the market continued higher throughout his second term. Sure there were other factors that contributed to the late-1990s bull-run such as the Dotcom Boom, the Information Revolution, millennial fervor and a booming global economy, but Clinton’s personal scandal had little negative impact on markets.

&gt; It remains to be seen of course what will happen with President Trump’s impeachment proceeding and how the world and markets react, but the market continues to march on. If the limited history of impeachment proceedings of a US President in modern times (no offense to our 17th President Andrew Johnson) is any guide, the market has bounced back after the last two impeachment proceedings and was higher a year later. Perhaps it will be better to buy any impeachment dip rather than sell it.

# Typical December Trading: Modest Strength Early, Choppy Middle and Solid Gains Late

&gt; Historically, the first trading day of December, today, has a slightly bearish bias with S&amp;P 500 advancing 34 times over the last 69 years (since 1950) with an average loss of 0.02%. Tomorrow, the second trading day of December however, has been stronger, up 52.2% of the time since 1950 with an average gain of 0.08% and the third day is better still, up 59.4% of the time.

&gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, December has opened with strength and gains over its first seven trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year when last minute selling, most likely for tax reasons, briefly interrupts the market’s rally.

# Odds Still Favor A Gain for Rest of December Despite Rough Start

&gt; Just when it was beginning to look like trade was heading in a positive direction, the wind changed direction again. Yesterday it was steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina and today a deal with China may not happen as soon as previously anticipated. The result was the worst first two trading days of December since last year and the sixth worst start since 1950 for S&amp;P 500. DJIA and NASDAQ are eighth worst since 1950 and 1971, respectively.

&gt; However, historically past weakness in early December (losses over the first two trading days combined) were still followed by average gains for the remainder of the month the majority of the time. DJIA has advanced 74.19% of the time following losses over the first two trading days with an average gain for the remainder of December of 1.39%. S&amp;P 500 was up 67.65% of the time with an average rest of month gain of 0.84%. NASDAQ is modestly softer advancing 61.11% of the time during the remainder of December with an average advance of 0.30%.

It was a popular choice with Mr Pichai being seen as a safe pair of hands with a collaborative style.

**Expedia** ($EXPE) announced a C-Suite transition that was altogether less smooth with the resignation of both the CEO and CFO after a disagreement on strategy and disappointing Q3 results. The company's now ex-CEO Okerstrom had begun a push for Expedia to integrate its brands and technology earlier in the year.  It appears he has been ditched due to a subsequent lack of focus on Expedia's core business that resulted from this push.

However pressure from Google suggests Okerstrom' strategy may have been the right one. Competitors Airbnb, TripAdvisor and Booking have all been implementing a similar strategy of integrating their brands and technology.  Expedia’s very real problems remain, namely it needs to wean itself off of Google SEO as a source of traffic or face getting further squeezed as Google continues to convert more traffic from free to paid.

There were also a couple of interesting articles in Barron's saying **Amazon** ($AMZN) ""cannot be beaten"" and that **Nike** ($NKE) ""is in the early innings of transition from a traditional wholesale business""

In summary, Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said other traditional retailers and e-commerce firms are unable to replicate Amazon's scale and capabilities. That means that Amazon can continue to grow by selling goods at a loss while offsetting losses with the profitable selling of services to enterprises. If he is right then Amazon looks cheap with annual forecast growth of 72% compared to a TTM PE 78. 

However it seems there is one very specific exception to Mr Bazinet’s assertion with Nike’s decision to no longer sell merchandise through Amazon showing that strong brands are realizing that traffic driven to their own site is self-sustaining, more profitable, and actually brand enhancing. Morgan Stanley’s Kimberly Greenberger’s has a TP 22% above current level and says, “We continue to believe NKE is in the early innings of transition from a traditional wholesale business to a digitally-driven, direct-to-consumer brand,”

Elsewhere **Johnson &amp; Johnson** ($JNJ) said on Tuesday that more tests showed that Johnson’s Baby Powder was free of asbestos and **Peloton** ($PTON) had a bad week with their Christmas advert branded “dystopian” and “sexist”. I am going to take this opportunity to say nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks (Signet and At Home Group)**

**Signet Jewelers Limited** ($SIG) reported Q3 results with same store sales up 2.1%.  CEO Virginia Drosos says the company’s “transformation journey” is starting to pay off with recent initiatives beginning to take hold. “Starting with customer first, much better product marketing, and a transformed media plan for this holiday season, better omni channel, iPads in the hands of every jewelry consultant, and better websites,” Drosos said “And we're driving out costs in the business that we've been able to reinvest to drive growth.”

The company guided to full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $3.11 - $3.29 which looks attractive compared to the stock price of $20.58.

Encouragingly Drosos said “In the jewelry category, the consumer market is healthy,” and continued, “We've seen over the last number of years low single digit growth in the category, and we expect that to continue.""

&amp;#x200B;

**At Home Group** **Inc** ($HOME) beat top and bottom line third-quarter estimates but disappointed analysts with a guidance cut. After a difficult Thanksgiving, At Home sees fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 31-36 cents per share, significantly below the 49 cent per share consensus estimate. That reflects 25% off discounting on seasonal items at an earlier time than At Home has ever implemented.

However the stock looks cheap following its 33% drop with a valuation of less than 10x current year estimates.

KeyBanc Capital Markets Bradley Thomas maintained an Overweight rating but cut its price target from $14 to $10 (Friday’s closing price was $5.67) and said “Ultimately, recent trends are undeniably frustrating, but we believe the Company is taking its medicine on markdowns and has mostly de-risked 4Q,” Thomas wrote, “New store performance remains strong and HOME continues to take share from competitors.”

Wells Fargo maintained a Market Weight rating and $7 target with Zachary Fadem saying encouragingly, “Looking ahead to next year, we believe the roll outs of EDLP+ \[Everyday Low Prices\] and BOPIS \[Buy Online Pickup Instore\] can drive incremental sales and improve HOME’s value perception with consumers”.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Duluth Holdings Inc, The Trade Desk and Ulta Beauty)** 

**Duluth Holdings Inc** ($DLTH) is up 20% after reporting strong Q3 results on Thursday that beat expectations with healthy top-line growth of 12% and improved third-quarter operating margin and earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Revenue of $119.90 million thrashed analysts’ estimates of $114.97 million and full year EPS guidance of 60 cents to 66 cents compared to consensus forecasts for 60 cents.

That’s good news for the rapidly growing lifestyle brand with well-established direct business. The company opened 3 new stores during the quarter, taking the total to 58, but has identified markets with 100 potential store locations meaning there is still plenty of potential for growth.

At $247.35 (market cap of $11.2bn) **The Trade Desk's** ($TTD) stock price has recovered some of Monday’s correction but is still significantly down from recent highs of $290. On Friday, Needham analyst Laura Martin upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy with a new $325 price target.

That’s in line with the CEO who maintains the view that most of the $700 billion plus pie of advertising will end up programmatic - that's a huge opportunity for the $11 billion market leader.

Global markets in particular have huge potential but account for just 14% of The Trade Desk’s current business. That figure should grow to two-thirds, reflecting the global break down. The Trade Desk is the only mainstream DSP with a strong play in China and that could drive huge returns.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ulta Beauty’s** ($ULTA) stock jumped 11% on Friday after reporting a strong Q3. Comps rose 3.2%, driving overall revenue growth of 7.9% and gross margin improved 40 basis points to 37.1%. Full-year guidance was raised to EPS of $11.93 to $12.03, up from a previous range of $11.86 to $12.06 and up from $10.94 last year.

That will suit CEO Mary Dillon who bought $308,000 of stock in September. The prestige cosmetics industry has seen growth slow from its frenetic pace of recent years but (on a PE of 22x current year estimates) Ulta doesn’t look expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

**Speculative and high risk (electroCore)**

This week, the UK’s Depart of Health agency NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) published its guidance recommending the use of **electroCore’s** ($ECORE) gammaCore treatment for the acute and preventive treatment of cluster headache in adults.

Even though treatment costs about £3,000 ($4,000) per year, the NICE guidance states that gammaCore, when added to standard of care, can save an average of £450 ($590) per patient in the first year of treatment.  Additionally, among the comments received by NICE in their review of gammaCore are endorsements from UK neurologists expressing strong support for patient access to gammaCore in the NHS, such as “This device has changed the way we practice - it has huge implications beyond the results of headache diaries,” and “\[I have\] had a lot of experience with seeing clinical responses and the meaningful and significant impact this treatment can commonly have on people's lives.”

That’s pretty encouraging.

Iain Strickland, Managing Director of electroCore UK, said “approximately 66,000 people in the UK suffer from this devastating headache disorder, and experts have reported that 25-50% of the most severely affected will benefit from our therapy,”

Back of the envelope that suggests (66,000 x 37.5% x 4,000) $92.4 million of revenues from the UK alone which would go along way to offsetting electroCore’s $50 million annual cash burn and set up the company for profitability.

Additionally, in the US back in April 2017, the FDA cleared electroCore’s gammaCore therapy for the acute treatment of cluster headache, or CH. CH is an extremely painful form of headache affecting approximately 350,000 people in the United States with an estimated total addressable U.S. market of approximately $400 million. Additionally, according to a 2016 market research survey, 87% of respondents reported dissatisfaction with the then-available treatment options for managing CH. 

Further, in January 2018, the FDA cleared electroCore gammaCore therapy for electroCore’s lead indication: the acute treatment of migraine in adults. Reports suggest an even greater total addressable market of approximately $4 billion and some reports suggest that up to 60% of migraine sufferers are dissatisfied with, or have contraindications to, the current standard of care treatments. 

Unfortunately the UK news probably comes too late to save existing shareholders from significant dilution. With an annual cash burn of c.$50 million and cash of just $33.5 million as of September 30th.  We could easily be looking at 30 million new shares at $1, diluting exiting shareholders 1:1 (or worse).

It is probably wise to wait to see the terms of that issuance before entering into a position. However, the guidance and comments from the UK are extremely positive. If electroCore can execute in the UK and bring some of that success back to the US then, even with dilution, it could yet be a multibagger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insider buying (Evolent Health and Kodak)** 

Insider buying at **Evolent Health** ($EVH) Inc this week with the CEO purchasing $228,000 of stock on Tuesday followed by a $100,000 purchase by the President on Thursday. It comes after a 75% drop in the stock in just over a year. Last week the stock dropped almost 40% after reporting that it’s largest customer, Passport Health, had lost the contract to manage the $8B per year Kentucky Medicaid business which it had maintained for 20 years.

It’s a terrible blow that could put Passport out of business and bad news for Evolent who derive 12% of their revenues from Passport and had recently agreed to purchase a 70% ownership for $70 million (expected to close by the end of this year). However I think the 40% drop looks overdone and insider buying sends a signal that management think so too.

CEO Frank Williams noted that there was a possibility that Passport would not be awarded the Kentucky contract in the Q3 conference call last month and said, “If Passport's contract is not renewed beyond June, 2020 than we anticipate services growth in 2020 of at least 10%.” That is a lot lower than the 20% expected if it had one the contract but still suggests a very healthy level of growth. Additionally Passport Health Plan has confirmed that they intend to appeal Kentucky's decision meaning they could well win some of the business.

However, even when assuming the worst case scenario of 10% growth, the valuation of Evolent (trading at just 0.77x sales) looks cheap. 

&amp;#x200B;

Insider buying at **Kodak** ($KODK) after two directors made purchases of $5.5 million and $11.1 million this week. They follow Executive Chairman James Continenza who increased his holding last week by 50% with a $103,000 purchase. 

The once iconic film manufacturer has struggled since it emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in 2015. It does have a number of growth engines that account for about 25% of revenues, including its SONORA Process Free Plates which grew by 22% in Q3 and the PROSPER Inkjet Platform which grew by 5 percent, but these as yet have not been enough to offset the decline and overall revenues fell by 4.3%.

The company is not expensive with a market cap of $111 million compared to net cash of $75 million. It reported Operational EBITDA of $14 million in Q3 ($9 million Q3 2018). However, with the core business still facing strong headwinds, it is difficult for an outsider to see any value in the business.

That said, what I can't wrap my head around is TSLA market cap.  Their current stock price values them as a $60 billion company. 

Ford which sells almost **ten times** more vehicles per year and operates with profit is only valued at $35 billion and GM which is #1 auto retailer selling even more vehicles than Ford is valued at $50 billion both have good P/E ratios.  That seems to me like the TSLA price is already extremely high and has years of growth and profit factored in, doesn't it?  

It's like TSLA is priced as if it has **already** become the #1 auto retailer, selling ten times more cars than today and then some at solid profit margins.  A price of $500 would make it a $90 billion market cap.  Is that not ridiculous for an auto manufacturer? Even with additional revenue from solar city?

 [https://patents.justia.com/patent/10494697](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10494697) 

Background:  Scandium is among the most expensive elements. Price for pure scandium fluctuates between 4,000 and 20,000 US dollars per kilogram. Meanwhile, the limited market generates a variety of prices at any given time... The world production of scandium is in the order of 15 tonnes per year, in the form of [scandium oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandium_oxide). The demand is about 50% higher, and both the production and demand keep increasing.  (source:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandium) )

**Scandium’s applications are in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)  (produced by $BE ).** SOFCs are a major application of Scandium. These fuel cells can produce energy very cheaply and efficiently through continuous heat-producing internal reactions. SOFCs (Bloom Energy fuel cell servers can use multiple inputs)  can be powered with cheap natural gas, hydrogen or methane produced from organic waste, and electricity from these cells costs only cents for each kilowatt hour..on par or cheaper with large Utilities (Utilities have a growing transmission  and upkeep costs such as evidenced by California wild fires, and resiliency issue - another topic to talk about later on ).

With $BE's hold on this efficient Scandium's chemical extraction process - it just added a tremendous technology and cost advantage to its Fuel Cell clean and cheap electricity production..  And that is going to reflect in their coming earnings reports and help increasing  gross margins $ as they move forward in 2020 (pushing Earnings and stock price). Also look at other patents that $BE won in the last few months alone:  [https://patents.justia.com/assignee/bloom-energy-corporation](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/bloom-energy-corporation) (Bloom has tens of patents around fuel cell technology and remote maintenance).

My personal opinion, **Fuel Cell Power Generation Technology  is going to create long-term huge upswing in the $BE enterprise value** (which will eventually show up in the current stock price\*), **as the Battery Energy Storage IP did to push Tesla $TSLA enterprise value..**

Would love to hear your comments...!!!

PS: My personal opinion (disclosure: I am a small (tech) investor and I do my own due diligence.. I am long on $BE) I look forward to the upswings in the stock soon (see my notes on the Short Sellers activity and their false rumors that did damage the stock...but their activity is now coming to an end and their misinformation campaign is over - you can see my other blog on the inevitable  Short Squeeze coming soon..)

They say that maximum gains are made when there is a discrepancy between market perception and the reality..so here are the three things I have discovered that analysts covering $ALKS out there are not yet talking about (or only sharing reports with their deep pocket hedge fund clients).. So here is my analysis for the small, hard-working investors out there saving their money and giving them an edge, for a change (big institution investors are always ahead of you most of the time)...  

Reason 1 =&gt; Alkermes recent acquisition of Rodin Therapeutics is a hidden gem..Rodin has a revolutionary patented (and it is important to create value) technology for brain mapping (neurons health &amp; connections to be specific) ..these scans are performed using non-invasive and easy-to-use outpatient technology (which means there are no side effects, and it is cheap and frequent use technology) ...and these scans have tremendous potential in Alzheimer's and other neuro-degenerative disorders (which is one of the largest and growing market need). This technology can be used in many other applications even for performance measurement for other drugs and clinical trials.  
I am not going to comment on Rodin's drug pipeline because they still seem to be working with Alkremes their new parent company to plan the trials - but that should be a big surprise ( I expect in Q1-2020 in their earnings calls). Remember, Rodin only gets $900 million if they deliver results and achieve milestones - so they will be working hard to get there. Rodin management and scientific team is impressive.. Do you know that Google Ventures is an investor in Rodin Therapeutic...!!!  


Reason 2 =&gt; Increasing funding to fight Opioid Addiction and Litigation Settlement Monies coming from Opioid Lawsuits will greatly favor Vivitrol Drug=&gt; Do you know that Vivitrol injection (monthly dose) is only a few of those drugs to help with the severe Opioid relapse patients (Vivitrol is also prescribed to Alcohol addiction patients ) that keeps them healthy without giving them another Opioid? Given the Opioid epidemic and Medicare/Medicaid approving the reimbursement for Vivitrol - the drug revenue is going to be on the upside...Do you know that most of the other drugs (these are called MATs) are mild Opioids - so basically you are giving mild Opioids to help patients stay sober (and exchanging one addiction with another)...Vivitrol is a non-Opioid that blocks the receptors in brain that create urges for drug addicts. So Vivitrol patients can eventually withdraw from it after 1-2 years. Vivitrol is already reimbursed by government paid insurance and private insurance..and according to the last management update they are already approved in 20+ states and expanding. This will be a huge revenue surprise visible in 2020.  


Reason 3 =&gt; This may be a strong possibility in late 2020 or early 2021 - but $ALKS is great acquisition target (for Biogen and others) given $ALKS wide ranging CNS drug pipeline..and new management team they acquired via Rodin Therapeutics. The 52-week stock range of $ALKS is $17.11-$37.75 ( I expect in the next year - they will be $45 target)..in other words - given where the stock price is today, there is a good chance that you will see 200%-300% increase in stock price...  

 Now many people will wonder what are my credentials and intentions to present such analysis...well, I let's say I have the background and doing years of research in this field, and on this company in particular because of the good drug they have developed to fight addiction. I am not a stock pusher ..I am a self-learning and hard working investor like you ... who wants to share my thoughts with like-minded small-investors out there and help them make some money knowing that universe will return to me multiple times over (hence my username and anonymity). Yes, I believe in my own research and I have long-term positions in this stock so there is a positive bias in my opinion.

I have only one ask - if you like my analysis and use it to make some money - just Click Like or reply to me so I know that you care...may be if you make a lot of money so you will send me a thank you note too :))
Please share other comments if you feel I missed any important points..I love to hear divergent views and not just drink my own cool aid (sitting too much in front of my terminals and reading research reports) ...

Anyone following DG? Here's my theory for what's up, what's your view?

&amp;#x200B;

DG is trading at historically high P/B and P/E ratios, and investors were aware of it, so when the earnings were good (there was a lot of loss to the run up of the earnings call, especially since Dollar Tree tanked on mildly weak earnings) most investors saw a good time to exit and capture their gains. So instead of encouraging new buyers onto the floor, owners saw an opportunity to exit before a more significant correction.

Other than that, I can't understand it. It's still murky because every stock right now is trading at higher than normal P/B &amp; P/B, plus DG does well in market downturns since it's a discount retailer. Investors are anticipating a correction to DG before the larger correction to the market?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I have money in many large US companies such as GOOGL, APPL, MO, PM, XOM, AMAT, JNJ, NWL to name a few. If the global economy or the US economy enters hyperinflation, will these stocks go to 0 or lose most of their value for the next 30 years?

I understand that know one will really know the future and some may disagree on hyperinflation occurring. I want to know if I need to really consider diversifying more or if it is safe to buy more and hold onto these stocks in the 2020s in a hyperinflation scenario.

What if the USD hyperinfates and then becomes discontinued and all USD currency is worthless? Will all of these US companies end up becoming worthless or will they switch their stock price to another currency or to gold?

* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell

Currently, I am holding mainly biotech stocks, so I hope my portfolio becomes less risky and focus more on long term growth.

Firstly, I’m thinking  of investing in AMD. I think it has large potential, and I want to hold it long term. However, i’m not sure if I should just buy it now or wait and look for a dip first.

I’m also thinking of investing in clean energy. I think i prefer ENPH (Enphase Energy) over SUN (SunRun) as of right now, but i’m not sure. Also, ENPH is pretty high right now too.

Lastly (for now), I’m thinking of investing in consumer staples. My two stocks im looking at currently are KR, Kroger, and COST, Costco.

I would hold all of these for long term; however, the market is pretty high right now so i’m not sure if i should wait to invest. I would be okay with waiting but i’m just not sure how to tell whether something is a good dip or if i wait too long and miss my chance.

If anyone could possibly provide some insight onto these stocks, or others, I would be glad to hear anything.

After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other expenses, the communications-software company reported losses of 2 cents a share, an improvement from a loss of 30 cents a share a year ago. Analysts on average were expecting adjusted losses of 8 cents a share on sales of $156.1 million, according to FactSet.

DVAX has a single product, a two-dose hepatitis-B vaccine, as opposed to the old, three-dose vaccine. Heplisav-B costs about the same as the old vaccine, is more effective, and was approved by the FDA in November 2017. DVAX will have made around $35 MM in revenue this year from it, but the company burning through cash and isn't profitable. The net loss seems to be shrinking as the revenue grows.

The adult hepatitis-B market is worth about $500 million per year, and DVAX has 7% of it. The only significant risk seems to be safety concerns. DVAX had tried to get the FDA to approve its vaccine three times, succeeding only in the third attempt with conditional approval, pending a post-marketing safety review that will publish its results in mid-2021, if I recall. An earlier investigation suggested that there were seven times as many fatal heart attacks in people receiving the vaccine than those that received the old one. This number wasn't statistically significant because of the large sample size, but nevertheless worried people at the FDA.

Yesterday, DVAX said that it had finished an interim report that found no greater risk of heart attacks in people who are vaccinated with Heplisav-B than there are in those vaccinated with the older vaccine. There could still be worries about immunological problems, such as anaphylaxic shock, inflammation, and shingles, but nothing major has turned up, insofar as anyone is aware. 

This puts the pressure on DVAX's sales team to drive sales of Heplisav-B. It's not clear how long it might take to generate enough revenue for the company to break even, rather than operating at a loss. 

The company had an oncology unit with some promising drugs in development, but that unit was burning up cash, and DVAX made the decision to shutter that unit's operations to focus on the commercialization of Heplisav-B. This was clearly a plan ""B"" for the company, since Heplisav-B has been on the market for two years and, while it's selling, the sales of $35 MM this year are modest. I think that the original plan was to rely on Heplisav-B sales to fund the oncology unit through the approval of a drug and commercialization, which would have become the real money-maker. But that's not on the table anymore. 

Given all of this, I've been trying to figure out what a fair value for the share price is. I bought my shares at a cost-averaged price of $5.3047/share. The price closed at $5.695/share today. If I sold all of my shares at that price, I'd be up by $2,439.375, or $1,585.69 after short-term capital gains tax. (I've held the shares for two days.)

The Wall Street analysts who follow the company forecast a one-year share price of $13/share. That seems crazy to me and I'm not impressed with Wall Streets' previous forecasts, when DVAX had its oncology unit. Whenever any Wall Street analyst would declare a forecast, DVAX's price would drop by at least 50%. The worst came recently, when the share price crashed to $2.60/share. 

I have little faith that $13/share is even remotely possible in one year unless Heplisav-B experiences explosive sales growth, but it's difficult to imagine how they could achieve this. The share price has been volatile, dropping to $5.23/share yesterday, and gapping up at the open today close to $6.00/share before falling back down.

Because I've made over a $30k bet on DVAX, I've set conditional sell orders with my brokerage. Whenever a particular lot of shares falls in price to $0.02 above what I paid for that lot, a sell limit order will get triggered. The idea is to protect myself from a violent swing downward, while not setting a profit exit but just letting the price go on the upside. I'd like to hold for one year to see what happens, but I don't want to risk a trip back to $2.60/share. For all I know, the next quarterly report could hurl the stock price toward $0. Without any concrete interim data, I don't know what to expect. There's no obvious bottom support level, and the share price seems to mostly be influenced by a tug-of-war among day traders.

If DVAX is going to get to $13.00/share in one year, it would have to appreciate by around $0.625/month on average. If that's true, it seems reasonable to expect the price to stabilize above $6.00/share by Christmas, barring a recession, bear market without a recession, institutional price manipulation, and price manipulation by speculators.

I started trading in early 2016.  I was shocked that I made good money.  I bought FATE at 1.75 and sold at 2.90 a couple of  months after I bought it.  And then I bought AMD at 1.95 and sold for 4.  I bought  MGT at .80 and sold the same week for 2.00 (shot up to like 7 or 8 dollars a week or so later).   I bought SRPT at 12 and sold for 15 the same day.   

Current FATE price:  14.11 (hit almost 23 in July 2019...roughly 3 years after I bought)

Current AMD price: 38.90 (hit almost 42 last month...a little over 3 years after buying)

Current SRPT price:  111.31 (hit over 160 last year.. a little over 2 years after buying)

Again, ALL THREE of these stocks were 10 baggers within 3 years.  How do I develop the mindset NOT to panick and secure profit?    I was new to trading (even though I won my high school stock contest in math class) but the bull market had already continued for 7 years and I was afraid that eventually it will come down.

China’s growth has been slowing, despite recent positive reports, as the trade war wages on and geopolitical tensions increase. Among others, countries like Singapore and South Korea, who export manufactured goods to China, are slowing.

Positive economic signs do persist, with consumption remaining steady at 2%, and private residential investment increasing in the third quarter of 2019. (though this has steadily declined since the end of 2017). Despite this, business investment has begun to fall.

Large companies have cut back capital expenditures, citing policy uncertainty and the trade war as harbingers. With declining investment in business, wages will likely decline, leading to weaker demand and slower hiring.

Certain financial markets have shown signs of slowing. The collateralized loan obligation market has seen falling standards in the value of the products. This market is comprised of risky loans that have increasingly been substituted for junk bonds in the U.S.

The Federal Reserve has intervened in the repo market, suggesting liquidity issues, as reported by Bloomberg. Beyond that, government policy won’t provide much economic support, as interest rates have already been low (below 2%) and the Fed likely won’t implement quantitative easing unless an economic crisis breaks out.

The signs of economic downturn don’t stop there. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released data supporting more evidence that U.S. industry has slowed in the last six months.

U.S. industrial companies are not placing new orders for equipment, leading to lower production. Lower productions leads to fewer jobs. ISM®’s New Orders Index were 47.2 percent in November,

a 1.9 percentage point decrease against 49.1 percent reported in October. New orders contracted for a fourth straight month, leading to a decline in stocks of approximately 350 points.

The U.S. could benefit from global weakness, as capital flows could be sent to the U.S. amid political unrest elsewhere. China weakness and slow downs in Germany and South Korea, as well as protests in Hong Kong, Spain, Latin America, the Middle East, and elsewhere, could see a flight to the calmer shores of the U.S.

The weak overarching economic data, including the poor manufacturing data, kept gold prices steady.

As reported by CNBC, gold remained “little changed at $1,464.20 per ounce. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.3% at $1469.2.” The manufacturing data will likely support gold throughout trading today.

“Market started the day on a risk-on tone, but got caught off guard when the ISM data was a bit weaker-than-expected. We saw equities, yields and the dollar all correct, which has helped gold a bit,” said Ryan McKay, a commodity strategist at TD Securities.

Though some experts remain pessimistic that further rate cuts will five the economy a shot in the arm, others say further rate cutting remains on the table.

“The notion is that the U.S. Federal Reserve is done cutting (interest rates) for now and we’ll need to see a trend in weaker data through early 2020 to convince the market that we’re going to get more cuts. Until then, there’s no real impetus to see gold rally,” McKay added.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I’m socially far left and fiscally more centre left. Wealth inequality in the United States is absolutely appalling. I don’t want anyone to live in a country where people gain hundreds of millions in cash every year whilst median income households and generally common folk have to face the highest dues in student debt in the world and with a lot of these folk not being able to pay for or have the general right to basic health care either. 

I do think that taxing higher income folk via raising the top federal capital gains/dividends (how the vast majority of billionaires and entrepreneurs get cash) tax rates to much, much higher than it is today is great first step into moving towards a sustainable direction into funding fundamental health care and aiding a great deal to students. And I’m very open to many other solutions to make these extremely extravagant folk pay their fair share and to fund many other proposed beneficial programs for the lower and middle class.

But something does concern me about the wealth taxes proposed by senators like Bernie and Elizabeth who both I admire. The wealth tax taxes an entrepreneur or a billionaire based on the individual’s net worth. It sounds absolutely brilliant on paper until I thought about it a little more vividly. So the tech industry is the king industry in America right? And an overwhelming majority of tech companies generally don’t distribute dividends (in other words profit) to their shareholders. So the pioneers and founders of these companies result into very slowly and incrementally selling some of their shares in their companies or sell some worth a small percentage once in a while, so that they don’t or never lose ownership in the companies they founded. 

But from my understanding of the wealth tax, this would mean tech entrepreneurs or successful entrepreneurs in general who have companies who don’t distribute dividends, or whose dividends collectively don’t add up to enough to pay those annually due taxes, will have no choice but to eventually at one point sell the entirety of the ownership they have in the successful company they founded. And that does concern me because I think a lot of people like me dream to start a very successful business in the future, and I’d hate having to know that if I ever did all the right things to make my company grow or put my heart and soul into it so it could really thrive. That it ever got really big I’d inevitably lose my ownership in it in about anywhere from 5, to 10, to 15 years. And not to mention the effects of over saturation and massive inflation of many of America’s staple companies on the public markets or the general massive exit of capital investment in the country, and all the economically catastrophic effects it would entail.

Okay, I really hate to sound like I’m pandering to the snobby Bezos’s and Zucks of the world. I really do despise a lot of really rich folk because of a lot of the things they generally can get away with. But it’s not those individuals my concern is with. My concern lies with people whose ambitions will ultimately be capped by something like this. Or the ceiling it would ultimately put over anyone whose continually ambitious dreams have anything to do with business, entrepreneurship or capitalism in general.

“Positive data from China creates an optimism that the Chinese market is improving, that gives people confidence to invest in riskier assets, and in turn, reduces the safe-haven demand for gold,” said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit Financial Services.

The rising dollar also placed pressure on gold. In recent months, the United States and China trade dispute had led investors into safe havens such as gold. When the U.S. issued legislation in support of Hong Kong protesters, and China demanded the United States decrease its tariffs, trade talks stalled.

“Nothing particularly has really changed (on the trade front) from last week, the market remains in the dark about how things will progress. Investor appetite for gold is just waning a little bit on lack of direction,” ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said.

Gold has increased more than 13% this year mainly due to the trade dispute war driving demand for safe assets.

“The fundamentals are still quite supportive, this lull is not going to last too much longer. Maybe into year end we will see gold prices recommit the uptrend we saw earlier this year,” Hynes said.  
Silver sunk 0.6% to $16.93 per ounce.

The SPDR Gold Shares exchange-traded fund (Ticker: GLD) generally tracks the price of bullion. It fell 4.1% in the three months preceding Nov. 29.

to a gain of 7.3% for

The SPDR S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ETF, tracking the S&amp;P 500 stock index, gained 7.4%, not counting dividends.  
“The specs \[speculators\] keep increasing longs, not decreasing them,” writes Rick Bensignor in his Bensignor Investment Strategies financial newsletter.

Speculators have six times the amount of bullish bets on gold than bearish bets. “That keeps me bearish \[on\] gold,” he writes.

Regardless, he has largely suppressed share price / potential bounce as he has already sold 66 million shares which is an incredible amount for the market to absorb.

Prior to the holidays he was on track to be completely sold out by December 12th.  We will be able to better estimate his final selling date with tonight's #'s.

Kalanick has sold 66+ million of his shares and looks to unload the remainder it would seem.  His selling should be finished by \~Dec 12th at current pace.  Him finishing selling and resigning from the board alone will be enough for a rally.  

The stock has stood strong in the face of a dozen negative news pieces recently.  

We have witnessed massive accumulation near all time lows, and these deep pockets didn't do it for fun.  Time to unload these shares at higher prices on retail.  Technical divergences everywhere I look.

I am positioned for a bounce to 32-38.  Will take profits accordingly

AMD is up to around $40 now, NVDA is past $210.  $MRVL has been bouncing around the same range for months, so maybe that could be a buy and they have earnings coming this week.

I'm looking for a quite specific type of book about investing. I'm a college student, I've already had some finance / investing classes, and I'll have more in the future. I believe I know the basics, but I still have a lot to learn.

I'd like to read something that's entertaining and anecdotic but also educational at the same time (so basically something between The Wolf of Wall Street and a finance textbook). I would like the book to be centered around the valuable experience / wisdom of the writer, not just the raw explanation of certain theories. So far I've found One Up On Wall Street to be the best choice, but I figured I'd ask your opinion.

Let’s say the company I work for offer a share matching program. I have the option to spend a maximum USD$5,000 per year purchasing the company shares. This 5k is split for the monthly pay cycle and shares are bought each quarter. 

Let’s say your first quarter earns you 50 shares. After 3 years of being in the program and you continue to be involved the company match the shares bough in first quarter, in quarter 1 of year 3. So you purchase your 3 year Q1 shares and the company give you 50 more shares. And this continues on and on. Effectively doubling your purchases.

1. They say calls lose value over time, does this mean that if I get a call of ABC that is currently $10 a share for let’s say 18$, and in 2 weeks the share price rises to 15 dollars, I can still buy the shares for $10 a pop right for a net profit of $482 ( excluding taxes and stuff ) ? When they value decreases does that mean if I want to sell the call itself that is what is losing value? What if  I buy OTM and 2 weeks later it’s ITM?

2. Is options a better way to make money than just regular stock trading? I’ve heard jokes about losing your house over options trading but as far as I know you can only loose as much as the premium you paid for the call.

&amp;#x200B;

i am just beggining to learn about income statements and balance sheet and some of the important ratios. I have a question about Total Assets and Total Debt. 

I am including a screenshot of the balance sheet 10-k here or reference [https://imgur.com/nQYq0XU](https://imgur.com/nQYq0XU) 

looking at Kimberly Clark this page is for calculating total liability [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Total+Liabilities/NYSE:KMB/Total-Liabilities/Kimberly-Clark](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Total+Liabilities/NYSE:KMB/Total-Liabilities/Kimberly-Clark) . For fiscal year 2018 at the bottom where the equation is we see that **total asset is 14,518 which matches the balance sheet.** 

&amp;#x200B;

however looking at this page[https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Total+Assets/NYSE:KMB/Total-Assets/Kimberly-Clark](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Total+Assets/NYSE:KMB/Total-Assets/Kimberly-Clark) for total asset I see two different figures for total asset from the equations for fiscal year ending in dec 2018. 

&amp;#x200B;

my questions:

1) why is that?  14,294, and 14,277 are no where on the balance sheet (10-k) for total assets. Why are there two values? 

2) why does [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Total+Liabilities/NYSE:KMB/Total-Liabilities/Kimberly-Clark](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Total+Liabilities/NYSE:KMB/Total-Liabilities/Kimberly-Clark) show 14805 for total liabilities and [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Total+Assets/NYSE:KMB/Total-Assets/Kimberly-Clark](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Total+Assets/NYSE:KMB/Total-Assets/Kimberly-Clark) shows14564.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/december-could-be-good-for-the-stock-market-but-theres-one-big-risk.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks have had a bang-up year so far, and they’re heading straight into the month that is often the best of all.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 25% for the year. Thanksgiving week was technically positive for the market, with the small cap Russell 2000 breaking out, joining other indexes in an uptrend.
*****
&gt; Stocks, however, were lower Friday in sluggish trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. Through Wednesday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 had all popped to new record highs, with consumer discretionary and tech names leading the market higher this past week. The Russell 2000 is not yet back to its highs, but it pushed above its previous 52-week high, in a healthy sign for the overall market.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, investor focus will move more intently to the topic of trade, and that is what will make or break the rally at year-end.

&gt; President Donald Trump has promised that a preliminary trade deal with China is close, but there still is no agreement and the Dec.15 deadline for new tariffs is getting closer. Trump’s signing of legislation Wednesday supporting the Hong Kong protesters drew a negative reaction from Beijing and adds more uncertainty to trade talks.
*****
&gt; The health of the economy is also a factor for markets, and there is some key data, with the ISM manufacturing report on Monday followed by the government’s all-important monthly jobs data on Friday.
*****
&gt; # Best month of year
&gt; 2019 has turned out to be a very good year for the market, with the Jan. 1 to Thanksgiving Day period the 14th best for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928, according to Bespoke. The 25.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500 was the best for the period since 2013, and now the market enters a typically strong period.
*****
&gt; “December is the best month of the year. The S&amp;P is up 1.6 percent on average. It also has the highest frequency of advances, up 76% of the time,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. December is also the least volatile month of all, but it could see some bumps.
*****
&gt; “The market tends to go through a mid-December low, which then represents a good buying opportunity, at least through the end of January,” Stovall said, adding he thinks the decline would be no more than 5%. “I don’t think we need a big pullback or a correction. A mid-single digit decline would be sufficient.”
*****
&gt; Stovall said 2019 was set up to win because of the way the year started, following the sharp sell-off last December. When the months of January and February are higher, the S&amp;P 500 has an average total return of 24%, according to data going back to 1945. If the following year does not see have a similar double gain in January and February, it still does fairly well with a normal average return of 8% to 9%, he said.
*****
&gt; The market’s performance for the entire year also bodes well for a positive move into year-end, according to Bespoke. Since 1928, when stocks are up 20% or more by Thanksgiving, like this year, the S&amp;P 500 usually ends the year even higher, with an average gain of 1.8% between Black Friday and New Year’s Eve, Bespoke noted.
*****
&gt; # S&amp;P Sub-industry sector performance
&gt; Stovall also looked at sector performance for December, going back to 1995 and found that some of the worst performing S&amp;P sub-industry sectors were retail oriented and are highly dependent on good holiday sales. On average, computer and electronics retailers were weakest, off 4.5%, followed by leisure products off 2.2% and department stores, off 0.9%. Specialty stores and apparel and luxury goods were also among the 10 poorest performers.
*****
&gt; While 87% of the sub-industry sectors were positive, the top performer was homebuilding, up 4.5 %, followed by home improvement retail.
*****
&gt; “You want to buy now what nobody wants to own,” said Stovall, noting the market is forward pricing so investors are looking ahead to building activity picking up in spring and summer when they dip into homebuilders. Companies that sell fertilizers also do well in December.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Friday closed out their best monthly performance since June. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.4% to 3,140, and the Dow closed Friday at 28,051, up 3.7% for the month of November.
*****
&gt; Technology was the best performing sector for the month, gaining 5.2%. That helped drive the Nasdaq up 4.5% for the month to 8,665.
*****
&gt; Biotech was also a top performer, helping lift the Russell 2000, which gained 4% in November to 1,624. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up 11% for the month.
*****
&gt; # Trade tensions
&gt; The big risk to the market in December is the outcome of trade talks, but economic reports will be important as investors continue to assess whether the Fed was right in ending its rate cuts.
*****
&gt; The economy has shown some signs of picking up, and a string of improved data has led economists to look for better growth in the fourth quarter. But the critical driver of growth continues to be the consumer, so holiday sales will be an important indicator to watch.
*****
&gt; Employment data remains the most important of the economic reports, since a strong labor market is crucial for consumer confidence and spending.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the economy added 183,000 jobs in November, according to Refinitiv. The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, even with the negative drag of 46,000 striking GM workers and the reduction of 17,000 federal government jobs, due to the end of temporary employment for Census workers.
*****
&gt; “For the employment report, we think one factor that is likely to result in a slightly stronger headline payroll number is the fact we will now count the GM workers that were on strike,” said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram. “We estimated 36,000 to 40,000 were left out of the report in October. We think they’re to be counted as part of the November report. Much of that is going to be seen in private payrolls and especially in manufacturing payrolls.”
*****
&gt; In October, ISM manufacturing activity improved, and even though it remained in contraction, some economists said the slowdown may be showing signs of bottoming.
*****
&gt; The ISM index is expected to be at 49.4, still shy of 50, which shows expansion, but better than October’s 48.3. “We still think it’s going to be a sub-50 print,” said Sriram.
*****
&gt; October’s durable goods report showed a surprise gain in business investment when economists had expected to see contraction.
*****
&gt; Sriram said the speed of decline in manufacturing has certainly slowed, and she is watching the data closely. “I don’t think we’re comfortable saying we bottomed,” she said.
*****
&gt; OPEC and Russia hold meetings in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, and analysts expect them to extend their production cutting agreement. However, Russia may seek to change the rules for how it counts its petroleum output, so the meeting may not be as predictable as expected, some analysts say.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/29/19

&gt; Even with a holiday and a shortened session Friday leaving no US releases in the past 48 hours, it was a very busy week for economic data with 36 releases in the first three days. Most of this data came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading where there were no forecasts. While the bulk of the week's data was strong, manufacturing data, namely from the regional Fed indices, was mixed. We started off with a weaker Chicago Fed National Activity Index on Monday. The index fell from -0.45 last month to -0.71 rather than the expected improvement to -0.2. The Dallas Fed's index was also out on Monday and it improved more than expected as well as versus the prior month. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed's gauge on manufacturing was also worse than expected. On the bright side, other manufacturing hard data like durable goods came in much stronger than both the previous month and consensus forecasts. Housing data was also solid this week with better than anticipated home price growth shown in two of the three indicators: the quarterly Home Price Purchase Index, FHFA, and Case-Shiller (only the Case-Shiller index was weaker than expected, albeit up from the prior month). The second release of third-quarter GDP was the most notable indicator of the week with a much stronger than expected reading which showed the economy grew by 2.1% QoQ versus estimates of a 1.9% growth rate.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco1.png))**

&gt; We kick off December with another busy few days next week. Final November Markit and ISM numbers will kick off the week on Monday. While Markit is not expecting any change from the preliminary readings, ISM is expected to improve to 49.2 which would still be a contractionary print. In hard manufacturing data, later in the week we will see final durable and capital goods numbers for November. Vehicle sales figures will be the only release on Tuesday followed by the service counterparts to Markit and ISM indices on Wednesday as the rest of the week's main focus will be on labor data. After a surprisingly strong release last month, Nonfarm Payrolls is again expecting a strong print showing 190K jobs created in the month of November.

# Stocks To Be The Most Thankful For

&gt; Below is a list of the 25 best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tops the list with a gain of more than 100%. While no other S&amp;P 500 stocks have yet to double this year, another semi name, Lam Research (LRCX) has come close with a gain of 99%. Xerox (XRX), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Target (TGT) have also all risen more than 90%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-2.png))**

&gt; Apple (AAPL) is the 19th best performing stock in the list above. But because of its trillion+ dollar market cap, Apple's (AAPL) 69% gain has a much bigger impact on the overall stock market than all of the other stocks that have seen a bigger price move this year. In fact, of the S&amp;P 500's 25% price gain this year, Apple has accounted for 2.24 of those percentage points (or roughly 9%).

&gt; Instead of looking at simple year-to-date price change, below is a list of the stocks that investors should be most thankful for this year because of their contribution to the S&amp;P's gains. Right behind Apple (AAPL) in first is the other trillion+ dollar company -- Microsoft (MSFT) -- which has accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 25% gain. After AAPL and MSFT are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Together these five mega-caps account for 25% of the S&amp;P's move higher this year. While this group of companies has been vilified in 2019 for a number of things, they're certainly still delivering for the stock market in a big way.

# S&amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Running Strong

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 may be hitting record highs at a pace of more than once every other day, but would you believe that there are still Industry Groups trading below their 50-day moving averages? The chart below shows the rolling percentage of Industry Groups trading above their 50-DMAs over the last several years, and the current reading stands at 91.7%. Over the last five years there have been numerous periods where a higher percentage (and even 100%) of Industry Groups traded above their 50-DMAs, and the most recent was back in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA-Chart.png))**

&gt; So which are the two outlier groups that are still below their 50-DMAs? Well, when everyone seems to be taking an offensive posture in the market, it's only natural that defensive sectors would be lagging, and two of the most defensive-oriented sectors in this yield-hungry world we live in are Utilities and Real Estate. Even these two groups, though, are only about 1% below their 50-DMAs, so all it will take is one or two good days for these groups to get them back over the hump. On the upside, Health Care Equipment &amp; Services is the furthest above its 50-DMA at 7.72%.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is currently just over 4% above its 50-DMA. What's interesting to note here, though, is that just 9 of the 24 Industry Groups are further above their 50-DMAs while 15 are not above their 50-DMAs by as much as the S&amp;P 500. In terms of YTD returns, the S&amp;P 500 is currently sitting on a gain of more than 25% YTD. Leading the way higher this year, Tech Hardware (Apple) has rallied just under 48%, while Semis are up just over 40%. Behind these two leaders, four other Industry Groups are up over 30% YTD. While there is no downside on a YTD basis, Energy has been the biggest laggard and is just barely hanging on to a YTD gain. If Energy can't hang onto a YTD gain in a year where the S&amp;P 500 gains more than 25%, Energy investors may need to wear paper bags over their heads.

# Technology Sector P/E Highest in Ten Years

&gt; As equities run to all-time highs, valuations are at a fairly interesting point. As shown in the chart below using data from our Daily Sector Snapshot included with our Morning Lineup and The Closer, most sectors' valuations are at the upper end of the past ten years' range. Four sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Utilities, and Technology all have trailing P/E ratios in the 90th percentile or higher of the past ten years' readings.

&gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 established its first all-time high since July on October 28th, Health Care and Financials have been two of the strongest performers rising 6.68% and 4.35%, respectively. Despite these runs, both of these sectors still have reasonable valuations relative to the past decade. For Financials, the current trailing price-to-earnings ratio is in the 42nd percentile of all days of the past ten years. No other sector has such a low reading although Materials and Energy are on the lower end relative to other sectors. On the other hand, Utilities and Technology have some of the highest valuations of the past ten years with the current P/E in the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/PE2.png))**

&gt; As shown in the chart below, most of the last 9-12 months has seen valuations for Utilities consistently in the uppermost range of the past ten years as investors chased yield in a low interest rate environment. But as risk-free rates have risen more recently, valuations for Utilities have pulled back a bit as price has slid. While there have been other periods in the past ten years where Utilities' P/E ratio was similarly elevated, arguably only 2016/2017 saw it remain at the upper end of the ten-year range as consistently as has been the case this year.

&gt; For Technology it is a whole different story. The P/E for the sector got crushed this time last year and after plummeting to the 31st percentile, it is has rebounded to the highest levels of the past ten years. The only other time that the sector traded at a similar premium relative to the past decade's range was back in early 2018.

# Thanksgiving through Santa Claus Rally Trade

&gt; Everyone is talking about yearend seasonal strength this year, but it’s not news to us. 2019 has been tracking historical seasonal market patterns quite closely this year and that suggests it is likely to continue to track it.

&gt; Our good friend Larry McMillan (@optstrategist) trades seasonal yearend strength with the Russell 2000 from the close the day before Thanksgiving through the end of our Santa Claus Rally (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year).

&gt; So here we have run the numbers from 1979 when the Russell index data begins comparing R2K to the DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The small-cap index Russell 2000 is the best performer up an average 3.1% (median 3.2%) with an 80% win ratio up 32 of the last 40 years. Last year was the worst and it’s been down 3 of the last 5 years.

# Giving Thanks for the U.S. Consumer

&gt; This Thanksgiving, we’re thankful for solid consumer confidence, even though it has wavered in recent months.

&gt; Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November, according to preliminary Conference Board data. Even though the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has dropped from its economic cycle peak, consumer sentiment is still historically elevated, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/consumer-confidence_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We’ve been pleasantly surprised by the U.S. consumer’s resilience over the past year as other parts of the domestic economy have weakened amid global headwinds. Strong consumer spending has helped the economy grow at a 2% average rate over the past two quarters, despite drags on growth from business spending, inventories, and trade.

&gt; “Consumer sentiment has been largely immune from global headwinds,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect consumer spending to power economic growth through next year, so we’d like to see consumer confidence pick up more with signs of trade progress.”

&gt; Consumers have several reasons to be optimistic. Employment is the primary driver of consumer health, and the U.S. labor market has been resilient. Wages are growing at a healthy rate, and consumers are reaping the benefits of tax cuts and record-high stock prices. As long as the job market stays solid and inflation remains in check, we feel good about consumers’ prospects.

&gt; Still, there are growing signs of concern. While survey respondents have remained optimistic about present conditions, their outlook on future conditions has soured, according to the Conference Board. If consumers are feeling less confident about the future, they may be less inclined to spend and invest. That loss of confidence in the outlook could lead to economic weakness over time if consumers step back.

So they are considering a Impala takeover bid, since PDL hold most of the shares it seems that the vote on the 4th has already been decided and they will just accept. However my feeling is there is a small chance that someone else will come in and offer a higher bid.

Based on the above I was considering putting in a limit order at above the current maket price of $19.75 CAD since that is what the bid is. Assuming this goes through on the 4th my limit order will not go through and I will loose nothing, however if someone else comes along and puts in a higher bid the market will react and the price will be pushed up to the new bid.

Uber can continue to operate while it appeals the decision but the move may yet (worryingly) lead to other cities withdrawing its license. Then, on Wednesday, **Deere &amp; Company** revealed a horrendous outlook for construction industry with a 15% drop in sales expected.  However, appropriately for the week of Cyber Friday, it was retail stocks that provided some good news with Burlington Stores, Best Buy and Dick’s Sporting Goods all reporting beats and raising guidance on Tuesday.

**Burlington Stores** showed how “off price” and “treasure hunt” retailers can thrive even while more traditional outlets continue to suffer. In fact they seem to be benefitting from the retail apocalypse as they offer a useful way for producers and brands to offload excess inventory. Expectations were already high but Burlington thrashed them with sales up 8.6%, Q3 EPS of $1.55 smashed consensus forecasts of $1.40 and the company raised full-year 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $7.28 to $7.33 per share from $7.14 to $7.22.

**Best Buy** also reported a significant beat and raised full year EPS guidance to a range of $5.81 to $5.91 from $5.60 to $5.75 (and compared to $5.32 last year).  Some commentators said Best Buy is emerging as the poster child for how to survive and thrive in a post Amazon world. In particular the company announced that it planned to offer next-day delivery on thousands of items, customers will able to pick up products in store within an hour of placing an order and the retailer also launched hundreds of alternative pickup locations in areas where there was no convenient store location.  “We are excited about our holiday plans,” said Corie Barry, newly appointed Best Buy CEO, “Our teams have once again put together a best-in-class assortment, prepared an amazing set of deals and ensured we have great inventory availability.”

**Dick’s Sporting Goods** beat top and bottom estimates and raised guidance for the full year. The company has benefited from strategic initiatives that have focussed on better performing categories, more premium footwear offerings, faster e-commerce delivery times and investment in in-store experiences. Net sales were up 5%, same-store sales were up 6% beating expectations for growth of 2.9% and adjusted EPS was $0.52 compared to consensus forecasts of $0.38. Full year guidance EPS was raised to a range of $3.50 to $3.60 from $3.30 to $3.45 previously and compare to $3.24 last year.

CEO Ed Stack said the company had seen increases in both the average shopping ticket and in the number of transactions during the third quarter and added “as we head into the holiday season, we remain very enthusiastic about our business”.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Keysight, Nutanix and Ambarella )** 

**Keysight Technologies** delivered a very strong finish to the year on Tuesday with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high-end of guidance for the quarter while full year EPS increased 46% to $4.72. 

Keysight is the leading provider of network test equipment to telecom operators and other OEMs and has benefitted from increasing demand for 5G test equipment. That’s not expected to change with the wireless network test equipment market expected to grow almost 50% by 2023. Additionally it is seen as an agnostic way to benefit from the boom with no single customer making up more than 10% of total revenue.

Ron Nersesian, Chairman and CEO, said on the call this week “we are well-positioned for continued growth with a broad and differentiated portfolio of solutions targeted at the fastest growing segments of our end-markets. Our focus on the long-term secular growth rate trends in 5G, next-generation auto, networking, IoT, and defense modernization give us confidence in our ability to drive above-market growth even in times of macroeconomic uncertainty.”

The stock price took it in its stride, increasing only 1 or 2%, even after Citi said that Keysight remained its top stock pick. Perhaps that is due to weariness given the stock has already climbed almost 90% this year.  However the valuation doesn’t look expensive on 23x trailing earnings with earnings growth of 46% and a very bright medium term outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a couple of reasons why **Nutanix** stock is up 20% since reporting mediocre sales growth and an increase in losses

The cloud computing software company’s move (a couple of years ago) to a software centric rather than hardware centric model has hit the top and the bottom line but the higher margin business looks like it will pay off in the long run.

The market has had a mixed reaction to recent earnings reports but its reaction to this weeks announcement has been well received with the stock up 20%. That’s despite revenue of $314.8 million increasing only marginally from $313.3 million and GAAP net loss per share of $1.21 more than doubling from $0.54 last year. 

That’s probably due to two reasons.

1. Deferred revenue of $975.3 million was up 39%. This relates to the software services which Nutanix has not yet provided. It shows that the new software subscriptions business is growing quickly even though that is not apparent from the total revenue figures.

2. Non-GAAP gross margin of 80.1%, up from 78.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and way ahead of the 62.6% non-GAAP gross margin reported by Nutanix in Q4 of fiscal 2017. That shows that the new software model is way more profitable than the old one.

In short the new business is highly profitable and growing quickly. A good combination. 

The stock is valued at about 5.1x current year revenues which looks reasonable compared to the growth and profitability of the software business. Additionally analysts expect that software sales will start driving top line growth of 27% next year which should allow similar stock price growth even without multiple expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ambarella** was up on Monday after strong results with Q3 revenues increased 18.6% and adjusted EPS of $0.32 compared to $0.21 last year and beat forecasts by about 12 cents. However it was the continuing progress with Computer Vision (CV) that was the real driver of optimism. The results were good but on a valuation of 8x revenues and 90x forecast earnings they need to be.

Ambarella originally rode on the back of GoPro until GoPro faded and Amabarella had to quickly adapt. Investments in 2018 led to CV Becoming the target market with huge opportunities in security and autos. 

It is that optimism that is driving Ambarella’s 57% gains this year. The market cap currently stands at $1.81 billion against a market opportunity estimated at $18 billion and growing by 8% p.a. 

As Fermi Wang, Chief Executive Officer, said in the Q2 conference call

“In summary, we're just starting to realize our vision to enable big data analytics in video HD endpoint devices or AI in the camera. As this play out, we expect to see multi-billion dollar increases in our addressable market.”

That said, there are still plenty of risks with numerous competitors looking to commoditize the business. Additionally trade talks with China could also scupper Amabarella’s vision. 

For me the valuation looks fair, after strong gains this year, a lot of the positive outlook is already built in while downside risks remain significant.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks (Dycom and Cymabay)**

**Dycom** reported results on Tuesday with revenues up 4.7% while earnings fell 10%. A mixed result perhaps but the drop in earnings was due to a large and complex customer contract previously flagged in other calls that has added to costs and hit gross margins. Encouragingly that troublesome program is now ramping down and will finish by April next year. 

Dycom is the leading provider of specialty contracting services for telecommunications net work operators in the United States.  You have probably seen Dycom's crews working along roadways stringing cable or burying underground fiber. Customers include Verizon at 20.6% of total revenue, CenturyLink at 18.6% of revenue, AT&amp;T at 18.4% of revenue, Comcast 14.9% of revenue and finally Windstream at 4.8% of revenue. 

As a result Dycom has benefitted from strong tailwinds from the huge investment that has gone into connectivity infrastructure. Over the past decade the company has delivered strong long-term growth, including 10% top line growth and double digit EPS gains. That’s not expected to change with 5G deployments driving growth for years to come. 

On the earnings call Steven E. Nielsen, President and Chief Executive Officer, made several encouraging statements. In particular I found this one encouraging, “We believe wireline deployments are the foundational element of what is expected to be a decades long deployment of fully converged wireless/wireline networks that will enable high bandwidth, low latency 5G applications.” 

The stock looks cheap with such a bright outlook for growth and a valuation of just 5.3x current year EBITDA. Profitability metrics have been muddied by the troublesome contract discussed but, with that falling off early next year, profits are forecast to jump 20% and grow 14% p.a. thereafter. That provides an attractive PE of 18x forward earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cymabay Therapeutics** down 70% after it scrapped late stage studies for its experimental drug for multiple liver disease indications. 

It is a disastrous outcome for the company but with a market cap of $121 million compared to cash balances of $219 million, zero debt and total liabilities of $19 million -- it seems there is $79 million of cash that has been completely written off.  In short the stock is valued at 55% of net cash following the drop.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Highly Speculative (Toughbuilt Industries and My Size Inc)**

On Tuesday **ToughBuilt** **Industries** (warning high risk nano cap with market capitalization of just $5.7 million), the designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative tools and accessories to the building industry, jumped 50% after reporting that its U.S. and Canadian Amazon storefronts had sales in the initial seven months of operation in excess of $1.8 million. Equivalent to an annualized run-rate of $3.5 million, which is 40% higher than the run rate announced in May 2019 by the Company.

That’s a significant amount for a company that reported sales of $15.3 million last year and the market took heart that ToughBuilt could continue to increase sales with a gradual increase of product offerings to the Amazon storefronts and with products also being sold globally on its Amazon storefronts throughout Europe, Australia and other international destinations. 

Encouragingly, Michael Panosian, Chief Executive Officer of ToughBuilt, commented, “The initial seven months of operation of our North American storefronts has well exceeded expectations. In fact, we seem to be on an even greater upward trajectory in the fourth quarter and should continue an annualized basis.”

The stock has since given back a significant portion of those gains but remains up 23%.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Size Inc** (warning high risk nano cap with market capitalization of just $7.2 million) spiked higher on Wednesday (before falling back) after the company reported that it had secured a commercial contract with a leading Turkish apparel company (AY Marka Mağazacılık A.Ş).

It’s the latest in a series of positive announcements for the company since it was awarded a patent last year for its smartphone measurement technology. The company’s app, MySizeID, allows customers to quickly and accurately measure themselves using their smartphone, pick the store or brand they want to shop and then find which sizes fit perfectly. That allows an improved and personalized shopping experience for customers but also allows retailers to save on size related returns which can be material.

Despite the good news, this tiny company is running out of cash and I expect a secondary offering in Q1 next year which will be highly dilutive.  It might be better to wait to see those terms before making a decision on this high risk opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Insider (Matinas and Assured Guarantee)**

On Monday, both the CFO and Vice Chairman at **Matinas BioPharma** made $100,000+ purchases of stock. Matinas is an interesting company that has a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid-based composition (similar to Vascepa) under development for reducing triglycerides (named MAT9001). Importantly it has shown superiority versus Amarin's Vascepa for the same indications..

Amarin’s stock has risen 10x over the past year as it has successfully progressed towards approval for Vascepa. Most recently an FDA expert panel unanimously to recommend Amarin's Vascepa for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke.

However back in 2015, Matinas was conducting a phase I trial of its own omega 3 drug MAT9001, comparing it directly with Vascepa. It found that MAT9001 was much more effective than Vascepa at reducing triglycerides and VLDL-C. MAT9001 saw a 33.2% reduction from baseline versus 10.5% for Vascepa, and VLDL-C reduction was at 32.5% versus 8.1% for Vascepa. Despite that trial's success, Matinas put MAT9001 on the backburner while it used its resources to develop its lead antifungal candidate.

The company has since revived MAT9001 with a 100-patient Phase II crossover head-to-head trial against Vascepa on patients with high triglycerides that will begin dosing next quarter, with results expected by the end of 2020.

There is no guarantee that it will succeed and even if it does the approval process will probably take a while. However the results so far are encouraging and the insider purchases send a clear signal that senior management is confident in success. 

The stock price has increased almost 100% but, with a market valuation of just $200 million compared to $7.63 billion for Amarin, there could be a lot more upside for investors who join the CFO and Vice Chairman.

&amp;#x200B;

More insider buying at **Assured Guarantee Ltd** as Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Feldstein, purchase another $1.9 million of stock this week. That brings the total number of purchases over the past 2 months to 20. 

The company is a monoline guarantor that insures municipal and structured debt issuance. It ran into trouble during the great recession but has staged something of a recovery and Mr Feldstein seems to be highly confident in its future.

Two points of interest that caught my eye;

1. The company estimates it’s non GAAP adjusted book value at $90.18 compared to Fridays close at $49.65 (GAAP valuation of $68.94 also compares well)

2. The company CEO said on the Q2 earnings call that he believed the firm had $3.2 billion of excess capital beyond what was required to maintain its AAA rating. A meaningful amount for a company with a market capitalization of $4.7 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Pharmaceutical (Sorrento Therapeutics)**

**Sorrento Therapeutics** up 84% after positive signals from those in the know

Maybe I am reading too much into it but;

\- the company approached a number of potential biotech companies to discuss commercial partnership opportunities

\- it seems that 2 of the companies approached were so impressed that they have submitted bids between $3-$5 which were 88% to 213% above Friday’s close

\- Sorrento have immediately declined the offers saying “the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.""

I am not an expert on the company. I can see it has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $480 million (after the recent increase).

However it is the apparent enthusiasm by two unrelated outsiders to make an unsolicited bid having seen (I assume) Sorrento’s plans for development that is key for me. 

The stock is currently valued at $2.92. That is lower than both the rejected bids of $3 and $5, two analyst target prices of $21 and $28 and represents a valuation that is approximately 12% of the fast growing non-opioid therapy target market. 

It is often difficult to judge individuals motivations but when two operators in the sector get inside information and put in a bid at prices above the current price it sends a strong signal that the company is undervalued.

Of course of the likes of Warren Buffet seems to be favouring this ideal holding more cash reserves for an uncertain future. 

Is the same thing as last year going to occur where the grow over the previous 12 months was artificial, it seems in the case of Trump, China, the UK, and Europe, nothing is going anywhere fast with trade deals, brexit, and general slowing of economies, is the bubble once again going to pop at the slightest inference of weakness, such as paying taxes, or will it hold?  

It seems that having organised markets with a strong level of regulation as is the case with China is actually propping up other economies, but is this actually causing a hidden bubble that will poop even more severely, if not now, but in a few year time when everything really goes wrong and right wing interests have to keep pushing the narrative that something else is the problem attacking international trade. 

On the other side of the coin of course there is the idea, very much unproven given human volatility, that the swings are entirely unnecessary and with the growth of science and technology, which a lot of current governance is in complete denial of, we can keep growing indefinitely, in the end the computer, the internet, the smart phone, have increase productivity, and with AR and AI, human efficiency should only keep increasing so there is no reason for a market fall, assuming the populace are paid sufficiently to continue to play the game, which current trends of wage stagnations may suggest otherwise.

Around 12:00pm today this order was worth around $15 since the volatility was in a downward direction and it was possible that Burlington may drop below 225 a share (was around 226 a share). So what happened?

RobinHood deemed my order to be as risk and decided to close the 4 options separately. **Now this wouldn't be that bad**, I understand their ""at risk"" policy, except **they completely butchered the prices**. I had to pay $30 (an average of $.15 a share) to close the 222.5 puts (WHICH WERE WORTHLESS) and only sold the 225 put for $5 ($.05 a share). This is complete bullshit since worst case my option would've expired worthless.

    In other words, instead of RECOVERING $0-15 from closing this order i LOST an additional $25

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I’m curious about how you feel about Canada Goose stock. GOOS.

It’s marked at 38.71 today with about 6% gain from two weeks ago.

What do you think about the company itself and the stock? It’s very volatile but I think it is at the low dip due to the current political concerns and actual sales issues in China.

I’m thinking to put 20K more for a long position. What do you think?

Matinas is an interesting company that has a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid-based composition (similar to Vascepa) under development for reducing triglycerides (named MAT9001). Importantly it has shown superiority versus Amarin's Vascepa for the same indications.

Amarin’s stock price has risen 10x over the past year as it has successfully progressed towards approval for Vascepa. Most recently an FDA expert panel unanimously to recommend Amarin's Vascepa for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke.

However back in 2015, Matinas was conducting a phase I trial of its own omega 3 drug MAT9001, comparing it directly with Vascepa. It found that MAT9001 was much more effective than Vascepa at reducing triglycerides and VLDL-C. MAT9001 saw a 33.2% reduction from baseline versus 10.5% for Vascepa, and VLDL-C reduction was at 32.5% versus 8.1% for Vascepa. Despite that trial's success, Matinas put MAT9001 on the backburner while it used its resources to develop its lead antifungal candidate.

The company has since revived MAT9001 with a 100-patient Phase II crossover head-to-head trial against Vascepa on patients with high triglycerides that will begin dosing next quarter, with results expected by the end of 2020.

There is no guarantee that it will succeed and even if it does the approval process will probably take a while. However the results so far are encouraging and the insider purchases send a clear signal that senior management is optimistic about the trials outlook. 

The stock price has increased almost 100% but, with a market valuation of just $192 million compared to $7.3 billion for Amarin, there could be a lot more upside for investors who join the CFO and Vice Chairman in their recent purchases.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. The stock mentioned is HIGH RISK AND SPECULATIVE. Please do your own research

I (24M) am looking to get started into getting a real portfolio started. I've always had the inkling that I would start investing in the stock market at some point but was always under the impression I would need 1,000s upon 1,000's of dollars to get started. Recently, (a week or so ago) I started to heavily look into compound interest, dividends, investing, etc. after this deep dive I've come to a few conclusions

1 - The best time to start investing was yesterday the second best time is today and the worst time is tomorrow. 

2 - Compound interest should be illegal and if life was a video game it's basically a feature the devs put in and forgot about until it was to late because. Jesus. How. Is. It. Legal?

3 - The stock market is not the shark infested water i've always been told it was but it's also not a walk through central park in the morning. 

There are others but I'm sure you guys get the point/are tired of it by now. I have a stable sales job with great commission benefits. I live with a roommate in a fairly cheap city that is currently on the rise due to changes being made; making it a second Boston for Massachusetts. I have the ability to put away about 300 - 500 a month comfortably and am planning to start officially trading in early January or February. 

I plan on starting my portfolio with ""safe"" options such as Coca-Cola, General Mills, Johnson control and a few other companies that have been trading for over a century and provided dividends. I plan on buying into these companies for the first few years. I plan on leaving these stocks to grow over time on their own as a base for my portfolio. 

After a few years of this I plan on making a heavy investment into either one large company or multiple companies depending on what I've learned through the first few years. From this point it would be anyone guess because obviously no one can tell the future; we can only despair or hope about it but not guess it. 

I know I've rambled for a while but the main point of my post is I have a few questions I was hoping some vets on here could answer to help me get started!

1 - Is there a broker you would recommenced over others? if so why? 

2 - Is it legal to have more then one broker? is it smarter to have more then one at any point if it is legal?

3 - Are there actually any ""safe"" buys like everyone on YouTube or in blogs say? or is it always a dog eat dog world in stocks? (i.e. no matter what you do it can be good or bad)

4 - Is there a way you vet what company you decide to invest into? do you have a process on deicing to place with this company over this company?

5 - I've run into heaps of Warren Buffet stuff online whenever I look up stuff regarding anything about investing, is there anyone else you recommend I look into to see how they do things or should I be developing my own style?

6 - Is there any general advice you would give yourself when you first decided to start investing? 

7 - I've been adding in some new data sheets to my excel sheet for budgeting and the like to help me keep track my new venture. Is there any template out there for keeping track of your stock information? I'd love to see what I can add to mine.

SO no one has to answer all the questions in fact all of them don't have to be answered (But I really would like them to be). Those are the main things I've been thinking about since i've started this journey but I obviously have a lot to learn and to keep up with so if there anything you like to help me with understanding now rather then later that would be awesome as well!

(I put £25 a month on the National Lottery and very rarely get any small winnings so I’m thinking that purchasing stocks with this money would be a better ROI)

Where would be the best place to start investing with such a low monthly amount? Would I be better to invest in UK companies or would it be better to invest in well established companies with a current low share price (I.e BT / Intu / Lloyd’s banking group etc) or would it be better to focus on commodities or Forex?

I’ve downloaded Hargreaves Lansdown however been using Plus500 demo mode for a month or so to get used to the market and basics etc.

Being realistic, I’m not assuming to become mega wealthy by any means however would be nice to make a few grand over 10 - 20 years or so to put towards the wee ones savings when she’s older.

Apologies if I’m asking questions that’s no doubt been asked before but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

If I understand calls correctly, if I buy this option, the stock has a month to go up 50 cent? Random noise could cover this. It just seems too good to be true.

Everyone likes to talk about how they made a great deal by buying SHOP, TSLA during the dip or DIS but nobody talks about the red in your portfolio. I'll start with my 3 and why I picked them.

Overall my PF is up by 12% this year but is being dragged down by:

ACB : -65%. Biggest mistake. I wanted to diversify my portfolio a bit with the ""hippie stuff"" even if I knew that cannabis stocks are a rollercoaster and there's fierce competition. I bought some expecting changes in federal laws in 2019 and 2020 but the dilution and the competition is killing the stock. at the moment I hold but it will be a sell for me in a couple of months if the bearish trend stays.

BYND: -46%  I made some money during the first months (+20%) but my FOMO fired up at 155 USD and yeah... No comments. Holding

UBI: -28%. The stock was overvalued at 70 EUR and the P/E ratio was 65 compared to other gaming stocks of 25 PE. I banked on a possible announcement of a new AC and a new franchise but the latest game Breakpoint literally broke the stock in half. Will sell around the next EC.

FSLR: -14% I really like the ethics of that company, and they're the biggest player in solar in California. And CA, with all the power outage, will have to massively invest into renewables. I know that's last year of the 30% solar tax credit but with next year elections we may see a return to a tax credit. Buying more.
