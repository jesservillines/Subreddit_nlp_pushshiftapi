The presentation by Mr. Mo is titled, “*Lithium Ion Battery Thermal Runaway Propagation Mitigation with Carbon Fiber Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS).”*

Thermal runaway is a rare but dangerous and often explosive condition that can occur in battery packs. KULR’s [**TRS**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=V2un64myYQguR6nabKlZgjhRFPLq7NmtWaYdkHoWYGg9ftiWfAX3RL5I9z0fp2Fk6kGRaiMwX33vV6f7clxYGPNoAy7rQcMbe7-iyVDewezU0bjL8URgEsMwh6KPU86O) technology, when configured in bag form (used for safe storage and transport of batteries), is a proprietary solution that has been proven in multiple government-run laboratory tests to be the most effective solution for mitigating the explosive impact associated with a thermal runaway event and preventing thermal runaway propagation.  KULR’s TRS bag was selected by [**NASA to transport and store batteries onboard the International Space Station**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rH0AahU9IWEst_vk91qh5AxiJwv-uO0f2oniJtK6frU9nzNP2htpdmIy9jzgSsXNYtlvAes2Xg7ogdZ2tDTDquBd2Epbq9_MbmA6mJDIf-e8GM9F1Bgp6zpXnJFu8o7aIk74pxYBnUQavr0um14_A1ZHmwaX8CjhkRCCpyis8qm_4uCR7VKjlM3NAy7gq2VXB9GL9HAbqmYLaD0-yMJ7sfVrVx-34P7gi6_Ip1jS2sjJ9XnDN86qV4SdBvEwYURJJd8b9QZt-ruGpc1i6Dfbpddj598qA9-UEF1blHc-4gG7CGA4UBjvACwAGOohNT3B3QveGNIZ4v5O9jxLZmVOD9glwqnPIxVvD7_pydMkwe6PBhNu40z2kCyW9_8QEjQxH-5wc0934jLSgCOgJuODEGJOOGOemnjrJDh0K0X53hI=).

The presentation will take place at:

**FAA Ninth Triennial International Fire &amp; Cabin Safety Research Conference**  
**Resorts Hotel, Horizon Ballroom**  
**1133 Boardwalk**  
**Atlantic City, New Jersey, 08401**

The KULR presentation will enlighten aviation regulators, designers and safety experts on how the TRS technology may be adapted to contain and extinguish an explosive event caused by thermal runaway in consumer products such as smartphones, laptops, vape pens, and battery packs during commercial airline travel. Since 2017 (thru July 31, 2019), the [**FAA reported a total of 121 air/airport incidents**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bHiYl44y3no7wjvIde8mlhcqVYsdfq06EtL08qns0Zd4UklHjDlOUeZ-h65uzWbwlBEybtsZPB4chqV7sC-zoqS943U3fTeKzMbtJvInGr1x1WlFYTAaAFjq1eAbaVL-9FrGbuAlOTgQUW0AUU_HwLm0ArnfuWx_8YY3nuYey3vaUvI9CAdo5GSmXq4LEKLzEfn6Y7DBVHi4f6eXz9Ju4g==) involving smoke, fire, extreme heat, or explosion due to lithium ion batteries.

“Battery failures are a clear and present danger in many areas but especially in airline travel where spaces are confined and response and assistance resources are limited,” said Mo. “That’s why we’re excited to present our proven solutions, the same ones NASA and other partners are using, to aviation and aircraft experts at this conference. I am hopeful that, together, we can make air travel safer for everyone.”

The conference, themed ""Improving Safety Through Data Driven Innovation,"" will also feature presentations from United Parcel Service, Boeing, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Airbus, NASA, GE Aviation, Northrup Grumman, the FAA and others.

2. I spent a lot of time comparing UPWK to FVRR. I looked into the companies web stats (time on site, user acquisition etc.) and reviews. Confirming my belief's UPWK was clearly the better pick.
3. The day I purchased UPWK, Fiverr was trading about $10 higher than UPWK.
4. My limited understanding of charting led me to look mainly at holders (lots of institutional holders) and cashflow. Both seemed to confirm my initial feelings on the stock, BUY

It frequently bounces between $0.60 and $0.50 cents per share on sometimes a weekly basis and then goes back up again. You buy $1,000 worth at $0.50/share, which becomes 2,000 shares. You wait for it to hit the $0.60 share price again (just say a day or two later, for instance) and you sell. You now have $1,200 and have made $200 just like that via a penny stock. The money goes into your ""core"" account and you leave it there waiting for the stock to hit $0.50 again a couple of days or a week later. You buy into the same stock again at $0.50. Now you have 2,400 shares and haven't actually added any additional money to the account other than the initial investment. You wait for it to go down to 50 cents per share again and keep doing that until you get like 10,000 shares (provided that the stock doesn't go up in price and stay there at a higher price).

I know that investors buy and sell frequently and rapidly on a daily basis. Just wondering if this particular method is legal and am I just having an ""ah ha!"" moment with penny stocks or what? I generally ""get"" the stock market, I just find it interesting that more people don't do this sort of thing regularly with 401K or Roth IRA. Yes, you do pay a $4.95 transaction fee to the broke for each transaction, but you're making like $195 of free money after that each time with just a few clicks. Obviously, as it goes up further into the thousands or tens of thousands of shares, you'll start making hundreds or thousands per transaction just by the price going up like 10 cents.

Is it technical or fundamental or manipulation? I would greatly appreciate if someone can explain it?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

There are numerous companies that could and most likely will loose massive market caps, and some will gain immensely.

Currently in my opinion, the one stock which no one should buy under any circumstance is Nvidia, unless their next generation architecture is a monumental leap in specifically gaming performance. The reason behind this is they are being forced out of the data centre and AI space by ASICS. They are locked into raytracing, so they cannot use most of the die area for shader units or floating point integer cores for raw rasterization performance, and their current form of raytracing is not going to be adopted because they are not in consoles. Overall, unless they can pull off a miracle, they will be pushed out of the data centre and gaming space by ASICS and their primary two competitors.

Intel is also in trouble, they currently have massive security flaws which has lead to a decrease in performance of ~60% when all security mitigation’s have been taken into account (not including disabling virtualization to counter NETCAT), so servers must buy more chips to increase server capacity, hence their supply issues. Furthermore, their desktop market share is in free fall, and unless they find a way to fix these flaws in the next revision, with a performance uplift and a reasonable TDP, they will be pushed out of the market by Zen 3, as it is entirely server focused and will introduce 2.5D stacking.

TSMC is well positioned as it provides chips for both AMD and Nvidia, two of the most major players for semiconductors.

AMD is currently in my opinion the most well positioned, currently they have had enormous success with desktops, in both CPUs and mid ranges GPUs. Currently their GPUs are about equal to the midrange that Nvidia is offering - at 100$ less, and roughly half the die area. This means they have great margins in their GPUs of at least 90%. Their latest CPUs are phenomenal, blowing away intel in almost every segment except for laptops. However, the most important segment is servers. Zen 3 is designed for servers, and with Infinity Fabric, we could see various accelerators added the CPU to aid performance in certain workflows, and with 7nm+, we could also see a 20% decrease in power consumption, or a 15% uplift in performance at the same TDP.

That aside, It got as low as $6.50 per share of Sprint today. I think the minimum payout on the merge would be Sprint valued at $7 a share, but I haven't checked if this has changed lately. 

The main reason I think it's a good buy is because once the merge actually happens, the combined stock is going to have so much potential in value because of their 5G network. This will probably lead to a lot of first time switchers from Verizon and ATT to T-Mobile.

📷**Zacks Equity Research**

September 5, 2019

**Leidos Holdings, Inc**. LDOS has recently collaborated with KULR Technology Group to supply National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS) storage solution. The TRS solution will be utilized to store laptop lithium-ion batteries on the International Space Station (ISS).  


Notably, this is part of NASA’s $159 million contract for procuring multiple technology innovations, which Leidos Holdings recently won. As part of this agreement, Leidos Holdings will utilize KULR Technology’s cost-effective TRS solution to improve cargo planning, processes and packing capabilities for the ISS.  


**Significance of Thermal Runaway Shield**  


Over heated, over charged or damaged lithium ion batteries can transit into a thermal runaway reaction with further heat and gas release. In certain cases when one lithium-ion cell in a pack catches on fire and it spreads through the entire pack, which is when a thermal runaway propagation occurs. Lithium ion batteries are widely used by NASA in varied items ranging from space suit to space vehicles. In fact, NASA was one of the earliest proponents of such battery use in space, due to smaller batteries and long-life expectancy. Moreover, these batteries have better energy density, often more than two times greater than other battery chemistries.  


However, at high temperatures the cells of these batteries become thermally unstable leading to events like thermal runaway. Sadly, even the possibility of a single-cell thermal runaway is a matter of concern, since if it occurs all batteries in package will be destroyed owing to domino effect, causing thermal runaway propagation. Consequently, NASA aspires to prevent any event of thermal runaway, which can be catastrophic for space vehicles.  


This is where the thermal runaway shield comes in handy, as it minimizes the chances of an explosion and other risks associated with thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. The shield contains vertically-aligned carbon fiber material, which prevents thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries in extremely demanding spaces with minimal contact pressure.  


**Benefits of the Collaboration**  


KULR Technology's patented TRS is well known for its capabilities to prevent thermal runaway propagation, which has been a serious concern for aerospace and defense customers, and electric vehicle manufacturers. Its unique combination and configuration of the shield passively draws intense heat of cell failures away from nearby cell, which helps to keep lithium ion batteries cooler and safer.  


With increased use of lithium ion batteries by NASA over time, the demand for TRS will also rise. As the U.S. administration strongly focuses on strengthening the nation’s space research and development, Leidos Holdings’ latest partnership with KULR Technology paves the way for improving the efficiency of thermal management solutions. This in turn will allow the company to acquire more contracts from NASA, which has been allotted a spending provision of $21 billion for fiscal 2020, by the U.S. government — strongest on record budget for the agency.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 23rd, 2019.

# **Week ahead: As stocks struggle to break to new highs, markets could be swayed by Fed speakers, trade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/20/as-stocks-reach-for-new-highs-markets-could-be-swayed-by-fed-speakers.html)**
*****
&gt; Developments in U.S.-Chinese trade talks and the comments from a host of Fed speakers could be important for markets in the week ahead, as stocks struggle to regain highs.
*****
&gt; The Fed in the past week cut interest rates for the second time in two months, but the latest forecasts of Fed officials showed just how divided they are on the need for future rate cuts. Five wanted deeper cuts, five didn’t want any cuts and another seven were happy with the Fed’s action.
*****
&gt; “The market seems like it’s pretty jumpy based on what the say. i think it would flip back and forth depending on how the headlines come out,” said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies. Simons said the focus will also be on the Fed’s operations in the short-term funding market, after turbulence in the overnight market in the past week temporarily sent some overnight rates sharply higher.
*****
&gt; There are nearly a dozen Fed speakers on the calendar in the coming week, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is not scheduled to speak.
*****
&gt; Trade developments could continue to cause volatility in markets. Reports Friday that Chinese agriculture officials canceled visits to farms in Montana and Nebraska sent stocks lower, for fear it signaled that talks were not making progress.
*****
&gt; Stocks in the past week were lower, with the S&amp;P off about 0.5% to 2,992. The index had been around 1% away from its all-time high for a few weeks.
*****
&gt; “Tech that has been out of play and is acting faulty. it’s now turning into a headwind, and that could cause a problem for the bulls,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “I haven’t seen so many mixed signals in the market in quite some time.”
*****
&gt; “It’s hard for the market to make new highs without tech. At best, it’s concerning when you see key names, like Amazon and Netflix, not just failing to lead but faltering,” he said. Netflix was down more than 8% for the week, and Amazon was off 2.6%.
*****
&gt; Redler said it was a concern that shares of market leader Microsoft gave up its initial gains and turned negative, soon after it announced a buyback and raised its dividend. “Strength was sold instead of embraced,” he said. “That was good news. What are they going to do when bad news happens?”
*****
&gt; Following the attacks on Saudi Aramco last week, the United Nations General Assembly in New York and meetings around it take on more importance for markets. U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials have said Iran was behind the attack, which knocked a significant amount of Saudi oil production off line. Iran has denied involvement, and Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility.
*****
&gt; Iran’ President Hassan Rouhani has been given a visa to travel to New York for the UN. Before the attack on Saudi Arabia last week, President Donald Trump had suggested he would speak to Rouhani but there seems little chance of that now. Oil have been highly volatile, with Brent crude futures up 7% since the attack as Saudi Arabia sought to assure markets that it would be able to bring its operations back on line.
*****
&gt; There is some economic data that will also be important to markets. There is manufacturing PMI Monday, important after ISM manufacturing data showed a contraction in August. Durable goods will also be important on Friday, as will personal consumption data, which includes the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator, the core PCE deflator.
*****
&gt; “What Powell said in his remarks was inflation was below his target,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “But even the core PCE deflator is expected to be 1.8, a new high for the year.” The Fed’s target inflation rate is 2%, and other inflation measures have been above that, including core CPI.
*****
&gt; The Fed will also be in focus after problems in the overnight funding market, used by banks in need of short term cash. Rates spiked for repo, or repurchase agreements, in a chaotic two-day period Monday and Tuesday. The Fed’s target fed funds rate also moved above its target range, in an unusual move.
*****
&gt; The market has since calmed after the Fed carried out open market operations to add liquidity to the market. On Friday, it announced three 14-day operations involving $30 billion as well as continued overnight operations of at least $75 billion each.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed has absolute control over short term rates. It was caught sleeping at the wheel,” said Chandler.
*****
&gt; Powell said the Fed would monitor the market and take whatever action is needed. The market is considered the basic plumbing for financial markets, where banks who have a short-term need for cash come to fund themselves. The odd spike in rates was viewed as the result of a cash crunch, not a credit crisis.
*****
&gt; Bond market pros have been concerned that the Fed would again see strains in the market at month end, when there’s more activity in the overnight funding market.
*****
&gt; “It gets you further past quarter end,” said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO. “A 14-day pushes them further into October. I think nerves will have calmed. The fact you’ll see fed funds print clearly in the range will reassert confidence. These operations will serve as a reminder that the Fed can have absolute control the front end if and when it wants to. This is a good thing.”
*****
&gt; The funds rate was at 1.90% Thursday, within the target rate range of 1.75% to 2%.
*****
&gt; “They’re removing any doubt of their ability to take control of fed funds in the modern framework. They just announced $165 billion over quarter-end , and we may go bigger. They haven’t done a repo injection in 10 years,” said Hill.

# S&amp;P 500 down 23 of 29 during week after September options expiration, average loss 0.95%

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines especially since 1990. The week after September options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 29 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just three times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are in the following sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –1.02%, S&amp;P 500 –0.95%, NASDAQ –0.90% and a sizable –1.38% for Russell 2000. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer losers and position for the fourth quarter.

# October Challenging in Pre-Election Years

&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in point and percentage terms. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.

&gt; Pre-election year Octobers are ranked second from last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ while Russell 2000 is dead last with an average loss of 1.9%. Eliminating gruesome 1987 from the calculation provides only a moderate amount of relief. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for depressed technology and small-cap shares.

# Where’s That September Volatility?

&gt; September is historically known as one of the worst for stocks, yet in 2019 the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 2.7% so far amid a sea of scary headlines. Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 has wavered less than 0.1% from its previous close 6 of the past 10 trading sessions, as it consolidates just beneath all-time highs.

&gt; “Over the past two weeks we’ve had the European Central Bank meeting, the Federal Reserve meeting, higher inflation, a historic jump in crude oil, Middle East turmoil, trouble in the repo market, and even multiple NFL quarterbacks sustaining major injuries,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Yet, with all of those scary headlines, stocks are actually in the midst of one of the least volatile two-week stretches we’ve seen in years.”

&gt; We are quite encouraged by the overall change in market tone we’ve heard recently, with more cyclical names taking the baton and leading, but with the S&amp;P 500 up near our fair value target of 3,000, we would be on the lookout for this sea of tranquility to get rougher at any time. In fact, according to historical calendars, we may need to be on high guard for the second half of September.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, The Second Half of September Can Be Tricky For Stocks, later in the month of September is when we’ve seen seasonal weakness. Things have been going well for equities in the face of some worrisome headlines, but don’t get complacent, as the calendar could be one of the biggest near-term risks.

# The Fed Hits It Down The Middle

&gt; “History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.” Mark Twain

&gt; As expected, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policy committee cut its policy rate by 25 basis points (.25%) to a target range of 1.75%–2%. This comes on the heels of the first rate cut in more than 10 years at the end of July. This cut is somewhat more controversial, however, because the overall U.S. economic data has been improving, and there’s been a tick higher in inflation.

&gt; One of the most important questions heading into this meeting was how many voting Fed members would support additional rate cuts. There were two dissenting voting members at the July rate cut, and once again there were two votes opposed to today’s cut—but unlike last time, there was also one dissenter who favored a larger 50 basis point (.50%) cut. Materials in the economic projections indicated 10 of 17 participants (which includes non-voting members) did not believe additional cuts would be needed over the remainder of the year, although evolving economic conditions could certainly lead to a shift.

&gt; As the quote from Mark Twain suggests, by looking back at history we can potentially find clues as to what might happen in the future.

&gt; Looking back at the previous two recessions (2001 and 2008), the Fed cut rates 50 basis points (.50%) to kick off the new cycle of rate cuts. We looked back at what the Fed said at the time, and policymakers didn’t foresee a recession; the larger .50% cut might have been their way of showing how worried they really were at the time. In other words, maybe the Fed knew there potentially was trouble under the surface.

&gt; Compare this with three consecutive 25 basis point (.25%) cuts in the 1995/1996 and 1998 rate cut cycles, which led to continued equity gains and avoided recessions. Given we foresee one more cut this year, could it be another three cuts of 25 basis points (.25%) and then an economic acceleration?

&gt; “Here’s the catch. When the first two cuts in a new cycle of rate cuts are only 25 basis points, this could be the Fed’s way of truly viewing the cuts as insurance,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the past five cycles of cuts that started with two 25 basis point cuts saw the S&amp;P 500 Index move higher 6 and 12 months later every single time.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Stocks Have Historically Done Well If The First Two Fed Rate Cuts Are 25 Basis Points, the S&amp;P 500 was up an average of 9.7% six months after the second of two 25 basis point cuts to kick off a new cycle of rate cuts. Going out a year, the S&amp;P 500 had gained a very impressive average of 16.7%.

# Strong Start for September, but Second Half Could Bring Trouble

&gt; As of Friday’s close the market is well above historical average performance in September. DJIA was up nearly 3.1%, S&amp;P 500 was up 2.8%, NASDAQ and Russell 1000 were up 2.7% while Russell 2000 was up 5.6%. Small-caps outperforming large-caps recently is not unusual and they did so again today. However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 29 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

# Broader Transports Still Outperforming YTD

&gt; With shares of FedEx (FDX) on pace for their second worst earnings reaction day since at least 2001, the Dow Transports, an index in which FDX has a weighting of over 8% (after today's decline), is down close to 2%. Historically, the Transports have been considered a leading indicator of the economy, so the weakness in FDX, and by extension, the Dow Transports, is resulting in heightened concerns over the state of the economy. Looking at the chart below, the picture for the Transports doesn't look pretty. The timing of today's decline couldn't have been worse as it came just as the Transports were attempting to break above the highs from July, but now it just looks like the second lower high this year. Following today's declines, the Dow Transports are up 14.7% YTD which is about five percentage points behind the performance of the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091819-DJ-Transports1.png))**

&gt; Given the changes in the US economy over time, we've been skeptical of the continued predictive ability of the Transports, but even putting that aside for a moment, a broader look at Transports shows a less pessimistic picture. The chart below shows the performance of the stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 index on an equal-weighted basis so far in 2019. By this measure, today's decline comes after the index made a higher high, and while it's back below those former highs today, with a gain of 20.5% YTD, this broader look at transports is still outperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a YTD basis. It may not be a great picture for this group of transport stocks, but it doesn't really look bad either.

However on Tuesday Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman held a press conference pledging to fully restore crude production by the end of the month.  Oil prices and oil stock prices duly fell back sharply.  

That reversal seems excessive and, for me, the oil world remains a more dangerous place than it appeared to be eight days ago.  The attack is a significant escalation of what was previously primarily a war of words and, even with US troops being sent to support Saudi Arabia, it shows how vulnerable oil supplies in the region are.

However, that’s good news for US based producers such as Continental Resources and Occidental Petroleum who make significantly more cash flows if the oil price can be maintained above $60 rather than if they are just covering their costs.  The oil price remains a random variable but after last week’s attacks the risks appear to be on the up side.

**Value Stocks**

On Friday Goldman Sach upgraded its outlook for equipment rental stocks.  United Rentals rose 1% in response.  The reasoning behind the upgrade is the belief that equipment supply has peaked and rental rates are likely to bottom in coming quarters.  It’s a cyclical industry and growth is expected to slow however it is still expected to grow by 3% this year.  Longer term, the trend of customers switching from ownership to rental is expected to continue to drive strong growth.  Despite this equipment rental stocks trade at a big discount to other industrials. United Rentals trades for about 6 times estimated 2020 earnings. That looks cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth Stocks**

On Wednesday Plug Power announced its strategic goals that included generating $1 billion of revenue and $200 million of adjusted EBITDA by 2024

That’s a big jump for the hydrogen fuel cell company (an increase of around 4x current year estimates) and I’m not entirely sure that it’s not partly wishful thinking.  But it cannot be denied that Plug has successfully reduced costs, found meaningful efficiencies and signed up key new customers including Amazon, Walmart and Fedex.

Perhaps the most interesting assertion in the release was that the $1 billion revenue target represents only 1% of its total addressable market.

Hydrogen cell technology looks like it has missed the chance to supply mainstream electrified cars but it still seems that there are plenty of opportunities in material handling for a small company like Plug (market cap $705 million).

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Situations**

Alder Biopharmaceuticals jumped over 85% to $18.62 this week after receiving a $20 offer from the Danish pharmaceuticals company Lundbeck. The offer includes an $18 up front cash payment and a further $2 payment if the migraine med eptinezumab is approved by the European Medicines Agency.

Alder plans to file for EMA approval next year and with 90% alignment between the US and European agency that $2 payment looks likely. Back of the envelope valuation, a 90% probability of a $2 payment would be worth $1.80 and discounting at 6% for 2 years would justify a price of around $1.60. Adding that to the $18.00 cash payment makes a stock price of $19.60 look fair.

&amp;#x200B;

**Large Caps**

Fedex’s sharp fall this week looks over done even though its problems are probably as much to do with dropping Amazon as a customer, near term capex requirements and poor historic acquisition choices as they are to do with the business cycle

Management’s decision to drop Amazon has to be the right one. Amazon is a competitor and the move will allow Fedex to replace Amazon with higher margin ecommerce business that will ultimately boost profits. Similarly elevated near term capital expenditures look justified as management balance near-term cash flow requirements with the need to invest to grow the business for decades to come. That can be seen with its aircraft fleet modernization plan that will pay off with significant efficiency gains over many years.  

FedEx has seen many economic cycles and industry challenges come and go. What investors need to recognize is that the firm is a leader in a duopoly that is seeing strong growth driven by ecommerce. The non-Amazon e-commerce field is fragmented, but provides a massive growth opportunity. Brie Carere, FedEx's chief marketing and communications officer, estimates that it will grow by 12% annually until 2026.

That makes the current $150 stock price look very cheap.  Even using the reduced guidance the valuation is just 12.5 times earnings. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Energy Stocks/Insider Buying**

On Wednesday,  McKinsey published its report on the ‘Global gas and LNG outlook to 2035’ which made a number of notable observations.  It said that the pace of growth in the gas market is set to slow, but natural gas will remain the fastest-growing fossil fuel and the only fossil fuel expected to grow beyond 2035. It also said that the United States is expected to account for more than half of the global natural gas supply growth through 2035. 

That’s good news for Kinder Morgan which operates the largest gas pipeline system in North America, transporting 40% of all the gas consumed in the U.S. its pipelines connect to every major supply basin and demand center.  Not only will the company see higher utilization of its legacy assets, but it will also be able to grow and build new infrastructure, especially in places such as Texas and Louisiana where it already has a large footprint.

Founder Richard Kinder said on a recent call “I believe that under almost any scenario, natural gas is a winner for years to come”.  He has backed up that optimism with $90 million of stock purchases this year.(KMI trailing PE 21 yield 4.8%).

&amp;#x200B;

**Highly Speculative**

Eros International Plc jumped 50% after announcing collaboration with Microsoft to develop a next generation online video platform.  The company has a NYSE listing and US address even though it was established in Mumbai over 40 years ago.  It is one of the leading film production and distribution companies in India and, with 11,000 movie titles, it has more local Indian content than both Netflix and **Amazon** combined.

However, since the announcement the stock has given up two thirds of its gains and it ended Friday trading on less than 6 times current year earnings estimates.  The reason being rumours of accounting irregularities.  

Now I cannot go into all of the details here except to say that there were short selling reports, a credit rating downgrade in June, a missed $2 million payment and a late filing.  Since then management has rejected the reports strongly, the small missed payment excused as inconsequential and a clerical error and the company has filed its audited annual report without any issues.  However, not surprisingly, the concerns are not easily dispelled and the stock (even after this weeks jump) languishes at a fraction of its previous valuation.

This is obviously not a stock for widows and orphans but the value proposition is as follows. Eros’ market cap at the close on Friday was $277 million.  Adding net debt of $60 million gives us Eros’ current total economic valuation at $340 million. Now the cost of making a film in Mumbai is not expensive, on average around $150,000, but replicating Eros’ portfolio of 11,000 titles would cost Netflix or Amazon about $1.65 billion.  Assuming a buyer is willing to pay 50% then Eros’ true value should be $825 million.  If that scenario came to pass then Eros’ stock price should rise 175%.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everybody. Some of the stocks mentioned above are highly speculative and risky.

From a previous post of mine:  

Little synopsis: Enphase Energy makes microinverters for solar panels that other companies install. Their microinverters create a decentralized power source such that if a solar panel is malfunctioning, the rest of the panels will continue to produce solar energy. This is in contrast to centralized systems where if one panel is down, the whole system gets wonky.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The company's platform provides access to talent with approximately 5,000 skills across approximately 70 categories, including content marketing, customer service, data science and analytics, graphic design, mobile development, sales, and Web development. Its platform also enables clients to streamline workflows, such as talent sourcing, outreach, and contracting. In addition, the company's platform offers access to various functionalities for remote engagements with freelancers comprising communication and collaboration, time tracking, invoicing, and payment. Further, its marketplace offerings include Upwork Standard, Upwork Enterprise, and Upwork Payroll, as well as managed and Internet escrow agency services.

They keep getting more and more users (20% increase year over year) and their only true competitor right now is Fiverr and they really lack in substance and talent pool that Upwork has. Looking at their financials it is very possible that they will become profitable within the next two quarters. The only potential downsides that I see is bigger tech companies getting into freelancing work market (like Microsoft's Linkedin or Slack trying to make their own platform) that could potentially harm them, but as far as I know Upwork is a #1 place where clients and freelancers go to find their partners.

What are some stocks off the top of your head which you think will offer stable higher yield but growing dividends, hold up decent value, and you don't think are over priced? Maybe I am trying to find the golden unicorn but I do believe there's got to be stock that is the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. 3%+ and growing annual dividend keeping up with inflation
2. A company with 15%+ net profit margin
3. Low debt to equity
4. An industry that shouldn't die (Credit cards, Industrial products like 3 M , Fast food icons like McDonalds, etc)

It seemed Hurricane Dorian had Florida as a target. The hurricane threatened the entire East Coast as it made its way from The Bahamas to the U.S.

The forecasts showed spaghetti models to give us an idea of where the hurricane was heading.

My kids were confused on the hurricane’s tracks, as I’m sure many of you were. All the uncertainty in its possible paths didn’t make sense.

But we trust forecast models to give us an idea of the uncertainty that’s ahead. And we know the importance of those models, even though the predicted track may look random to us.

Investing takes a similar approach — you have to trust your models.

The S&amp;P 500 Index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S.

And there’s a chart that’s ideal for making S&amp;P 500 forecasts and predictions.

Right now, analysts are using the chart to predict if stocks in the index will go up.

* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell

Currently in 2019 I think only less than 2% of cars on the road are electric, this means there is A LOT of room for growth. On top of this Tesla already produces the best of the best electric vehicles and old car manufactures are unable to compete. Tesla is decades ahead on technology compared to the rest of the world when it comes to electric vehicles. It quite funny, other car companies are releasing electric vehicles in 2019 that don't even beat Teslas very first car that came out in 2012! I'm very bullish on this case alone but tesla has so many other avenues for growth it's truly mind boggling. I'll quickly summarize the other growth factor and can go in more detail if you're interested.

1. Self driving vehicles, tesla is working on self driving vehicles which could allow them to have their own ""uber"" company in the future. Once again, tesla is wayyyyy ahead on the competition when it come to self driving. (They also plan on selling self driving semi trucks within the next few years and Elon estimates that car will be 100% self drivable in less than 5 years. (I'm really excited for this because self driving cars are a lot safer than human driven cars, and less traffic because self driving cars are also statically proven to be much more efficient!

2. Self driving cars leads me to my second point, tesla insurance. Elon has his own insurance for Teslas because Teslas are statistically way safer cars (and will become safer as self driving is implemented) I don't know much about insurance tbh but I know Warren buffet got rich off of buying an insurance company and Elon has his own the far exceeds what other companies offer (only for Teslas which is kinda creating its own ecosystem, same with their tesla ""uber"" service

3. Tesla has a premium super charger network. So basically this means if you need to fill up your tesla, you have to go to a charging station, similar to a gas station, the only difference is when you fill up you're giving your money to tesla, so it's almost like tesla owns the gas stations aswell! Also tesla allows other vehicles to charge at their stations which means more $ for tesla. Also no other car company has even 1/10 of the amount of charging stations as tesla.

4. Solar roofing tiles/ battery storage. As if there aren't enough reasons to be bullish on tesla I saved the best for last. So tesla can essentially save every person (who lives in a sunny state) money by installing solar panels on their roof, they can do it cheaper than most other companies aswell and their tech is very impressive. Buying their solar panels is a no brainer and can the original cost to buy the solar panels pays itself off in about a year. Also they can install a battery into your house which you can use to charge your tesla (for free) and you can even sell the electric you don't use back to the grid or just use it for your house... so like I said it's a no brainer to get especially if someone live in a sunny state.

Random other thoughts, once a democratic politician gets in office, there will likely be huge incentives to both electric cars and solar panels, may as well buy in now while theres a ton of ridiculous news going on about tesla. Also keep in mind Elon musk is a brilliant human who owns space X which makes them loads and loads of money which Elon uses for tesla, also Elon can raise money with a snap of a finger, so Tesla isn't actually in a danger like the media loves to portray. Also Elon musk is really popular among the youth, he's in a lot of memes, tons of popular youtubers have Teslas and constantly praise the vehicle so all those viewers will consider buying a tesla and all the kids that idolize Elon will also likely buy a tesla.

Oh my, I almost forgot..... Elon is about to finish the tesla gigafactory in China and Elon is also on the board of China's envirmomental government agency or something like that (he has an ""in"" with china) and china is also a HUGE market for electric vehicles. I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting but yea I'm bullish on tesla :)

Edit: one more thing I just remembered, tesla is completely self integrated, they produce all of their parts in house and they just bought Maxwell Technologies and will make their own batteries which is a huge deal (no other car company does that) Elon even ""joked"" about getting into the mining business and mining the minerals they need instead of buying it from others.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,410230,public,self,Why I'm bullish on tesla off the top of my head,0,1568921183,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/d62t6w/why_im_bullish_on_tesla_off_the_top_of_my_head/,all_ads,6,tickerdiscussion,612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59,Ticker Discussion,,,,,,,,

They've had several meetings and clinical trials of the antibiotic with people that faced a rare condition called Listeria. On September 19th this week they have another meeting set with the NDA to go over their findings and next steps.

In the past month MTFB has grown 40% in anticipation for this meeting and if it goes well, who knows how high it could skyrocket.

From my 3rd day on stocks I've already made like $25 on just flipping stuff at peak. I personally think the long game sounds like a huge risk as well as the fact the price of stock will ALWAYS drop below it started for a short period and always rise again. So in that every instance I profit just reput it back into something else where as if the person who waits will get a set amount but I'm capitalizing on the profits daily as well as reinvesting more so technically I'm getting more long run. If y'all think I'm wrong please explain why. As for dividends it seems too slow and pointless unless you just don't want to put the time into flips and want automatic mindless money but you also run the risk of stock dropping price. SO TO WHAT I WANT TO ASK: Any low priced stock around $10 ish that maybe goes 10-50¢ changes a day.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

The question came up in discussion whether or not ETFs were ""safe"". The theory goes that an ETF is essentially a vehicle that requires a buyer in order to sell. So if there were far more sellers than buyers, the ETF could essentially tank far faster than the value of the individual stocks within the ETF. This is not unlike a stock.

Many of whom seem to describe themselves as a blank sheet. It's easy to point in a certain direction, and say draw this on your sheet.

You see a clever marking ad how you can make money quickly in the stock market. Perhaps you see some clever post about a company that looks incredibly promising. This is all an illusion. Once you understand this illusion you'll be able to find instances of it inside the market, and use it against others to profit. People all rushing their buy orders on the offer because ultimately it'll fulfill their fantasies to get rich quick. Unfortunately, under very emotional circumstances, they'll be the first ones to bail if their fantasy becomes a nightmare. That's the strategy. It's an art. Get a really good understanding of what the *meaning* behind a move is. Truly try to understand why someone on the other side of the screen is placing an order. Review and review your trades.

I have written a few times at the never-ending problem of these so called ""helpers"" who'll sell you dreams for your credit card. It's selling you dreams. It's bogus. A bunch of hot air that amounts to nothing. They never teach about the art of trading. Shameful on the marketers part, but they aren't entirely to blame. Press releases are designed the same way. They sell a fantasy of what could be. The price will go up and *you'll* make money investing in *our* company. All tactics to bait in buyers. It's fantastic for liquidity, but not great for those who perhaps don't know what they've invested in. As long as someone has the *illusion* of choice, they'll still make the trade. These hypothesis could be tested in the market, using T&amp;S as proof, and conclusions could be drawn. Master the art of trading by understanding and seeking proof.

Many of whom seem to describe themselves as a blank sheet. It's easy to point in a certain direction, and say draw this on your sheet.

You see a clever marking ad how you can make money quickly in the stock market. Perhaps you see some clever post about a company that looks incredibly promising. This is all an illusion. Once you understand this illusion you'll be able to find instances of it inside the market, and use it against others to profit. People all rushing buy orders on the offer because ultimately it'll fulfill the fantasies to get rich quick. Unfortunately, under very emotional circumstances, they'll be the first ones to bail if their fantasy becomes a nightmare. That's the strategy. It's an art. Get a really good understanding of what the *meaning* behind a move is. Truly try to understand why someone on the other side of the screen is placing an order. Review and review your trades.

I have written a few times at the never-ending problem of these so called ""helpers"" who'll sell you dreams for your credit card. It's selling you dreams. It's bogus. A bunch of hot air that amounts to nothing. They never teach about the art of trading. Shameful on the marketers part, but they aren't entirely to blame. Press releases are designed the same way. They sell a fantasy of what could be. The price will go up and *you'll* make money investing in *our* company. All tactics to bait in buyers. It's fantastic for liquidity, but not great for those who perhaps don't know what they've invested in. As long as someone has the *illusion* of choice, they'll still make the trade. These hypothesis could be tested in the market, using T&amp;S as proof, and conclusions could be drawn. Master the art of trading by understanding and seeking proof.

Happy trading-

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 16th, 2019.

# **Week ahead: The stock market is poised to set a new record if the Federal Reserve delivers  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/13/week-ahead-the-stock-market-is-poised-to-set-a-new-record-if-the-federal-reserve-delivers.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, but what it says about its future plans will determine whether stocks continue their run at record highs.
*****
&gt; Tensions around this month’s rates meeting decision are high. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces dissent from within the Fed board from some members who don’t believe the economy is weak enough to warrant cutting rates. Two members opposed the last rate cut, and even more could oppose this one.
*****
&gt; The Fed is also under pressure from financial markets that threw a tantrum earlier this summer on concern the Fed was moving too slowly to stave off a recession. On top of that, the Fed faces an unprecedented level of criticism from the White House, with President Donald Trump repeatedly criticizing the Fed board and Powell, himself, for not cutting interest rates fast enough. This week, the president went so far as to call Fed officials “boneheads” and demanded they take the fed funds rate to zero or even a negative level.
*****
&gt; Against this backdrop, the stock market is flirting with new highs, as the Fed joins other central banks to ease policy, in the face of a global economic slowdown. Stocks were higher for the week and on Friday trading less than one percent below July’s all-time highs in the Dow and S&amp;P 500. The Dow ended the week 1.6% higher at 27,219, while the S&amp;P 500 was up just about 1% at 3,007, 21 points away from its all-time high.
*****
&gt; The market was boosted by signs there could be progress in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, as each side held off on some new tariffs, ahead of formal talks in October.
*****
&gt; “It’s been good news all around for the markets this week. You have thawing of trade tensions. You have more central bank easing, and you have Goldilocks economic data. Investors are thrilled...and that’s why you have markets just fractionally below all-time highs,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; Riding on the Fed
&gt; The Fed stands to disappoint markets if it does not explicitly promise more easing. The Fed could do that in the quarterly projection of interest rate forecasts, which will be issued with its economic projections after the meeting. Fed officials include forecasts for growth and inflation, besides interest rates, which appear in a chart known as the “dot plot.”.
*****
&gt; “The question is will the Fed signal a willingness to keep going with rate cuts, or will they suggest this mid-cycle adjustment is nearing its end. My view is they’re not going to back themselves into a corner, and they’re going to give themselves plenty of room to cut again at some point,” Arone said. “That’s going to be the biggest risk right now. The markets are pricing in a number of rate cuts in the next few quarters and will the Fed deliver on that...That will be a friction point.”
*****
&gt; U.S. data in the past week has been largely better-than-expected, with August’s retail sales up 0.4%, continuing a stronger trend, on the back of improved auto sales. The dilemma for the Fed, however, could be the fact that both producer and consumer level inflation picked up in August, with core CPI reaching 2.4%, its highest year over year growth pace since 2008. That is well above the Fed’s 2% target, but the Fed prefers to watch PCE inflation, which is running at about 1.6%.
*****
&gt; On the calendar in the coming week is Empire State manufacturing Monday; industrial production Tuesday; housing starts Wednesday, and existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed survey Thursday. But it’s the Fed that will resonate more with markets.
*****
&gt; “We they think they’ll cut 25 [basis points]. We think it will be a pretty even split between half the committee looking for one more cut and the rest looking for no action,” said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at NatWest Markets. The Fed shaved the fed funds target rate range by a quarter point, to 2.00 to 2.25% in July.
*****
&gt; Some strategists haves said the more dissents, the more it would add to increased market volatility, since the Fed outlook becomes much more uncertain if Fed officials are not more uniformly supporting policy actions.
*****
&gt; Cummins said he expects the Fed’s post-meeting statement to reflect slightly softer economic activity in July, and it will likely mentioning that the labor market may be just “solid,” instead of “strong” and that job gains have moderated.
*****
&gt; “That leaves the door open for more [rate cuts]. The dot plot shows another cut by the end of the year. You could make the case they’ll pause in October if things remain the same,” he said, adding they could also resume in December.
*****
&gt; Calmer markets
&gt; The Fed faces much calmer markets than it would have in August, when trade tensions increased with Trump’s tweet threatening more tariffs on China. Stocks have been rising as bond yields come off August lows, and traders are now pricing in a 25 basis point cut this week and one more for this year and another next year.
*****
&gt; As Treasury yields fell to record and multi-year lows in August, the futures market had priced as many as three more Fed rate cuts fort his year. Since then the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has rebounded to 1.90%— more than 45 basis points off its low.
*****
&gt; The more than 30 basis points move in the 10-year yield in the past week, was the largest weekly move since November, 2016.
*****
&gt; Trade developments could also move markets in the coming week, just as they have in the past week. Analyst say the market is most vulnerable if there’s a negative surprise. Trump’s tweet on trade Aug. 1, threatening more tariffs on China, created a new round of turbulence in markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s kind of ironic. Without the U.S. China trade conflict, the Fed wouldn’t be cutting rates at all, and yet President Trump continues to bash them to cut rates,” Arone said.
*****
&gt; Arone said the bigger overriding driver for the market is in fact the trade negotiations, and he said the markets may be too optimistic in expectations for a trade deal.
*****
&gt; “There’s an inherent kind of risk to the markets if in fact, tensions escalate again,” he said.

# Long-Term Treasury ETF (TLT) Has 2nd Biggest Weekly Drop Ever

&gt; Outside of equities, we saw a massive move higher in Treasury yields this week and a massive drop in Treasury bond prices. For the 20+ year Treasury ETF (TLT), this week's 6.34% drop was its second worst week on record since it began trading back in 2002.

&gt; Below is a look at TLT's historical weekly percentage change, and we also show how TLT has performed in the weeks and months following one-week drops of more than 5% like we saw this week. As shown in the table, TLT has normally continued lower for a while following big down weeks.

# S&amp;P 500 Nearing ATHs But Individual Sectors Not So Much

&gt; The past week has been a solid run for the US equity market as a whole. The S&amp;P 500 continues to edge ever closer to prior all-time highs; opening today within half a percent of this level. As shown in the chart below, on average across all sectors, though, it is a little bit less optimistic. The average sector is still 6.5% below record highs. Excluding energy, which is by far the furthest (in terms of price and time) from its all-time high, the average across sectors jumps up to 3.6%. Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only sectors within 1% of their highs while the Tech sector is not far behind only 1.5% away.

# Betting Markets and the Election

&gt; One way to keep track of the evolving Presidential primaries and general election news is the website electionbettingodds.com which shows what the betting market is predicting for upcoming election outcomes. In the charts below, we show the current probabilities of a primary and general election win for each of the various candidates (officially announced and otherwise) with a 1% or higher chance of winning. Elizabeth Warren now has a commanding lead in the Democrats' primary with a 34.9% chance of victory with Biden and Sanders in second and third.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election1u.png))**

&gt; Where things get more interesting is to figure out which candidates have the best chance of winning the general election assuming they win their primary. For example, President Trump's odds of winning his primary are 88.1%, but his odds of winning the general election for the Presidency are priced at 43.7%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election2u.png))**

&gt; By dividing that 43.7% by the 88.1% chance of primary victory we can get to a 49.6% general election pricing assuming the candidate wins their primary. This conditional probability probably shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it's got some interesting results. Among candidates polling over 5%, Beto O'Rourke has the highest odds (80%) of a general election win if he takes the primary while other Democratic hopefuls Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders are priced at 60%+ odds. Biden's general election odds are at 55% if he wins the primary, while Warren -- the current front runner -- is at 49.9%. Notably, although Trump is close at 49.6%, no Republican has a conditional priced probability over 50% to win the general.

&gt; All of that said, these conditional relationships can be very unstable and are complicated to arbitrage, so we probably shouldn't place too much faith in the detail of their message, but it's still interesting to see that markets are implicitly optimistic about the electability of a candidate like Sanders or Yang relative to more mainstream candidates like Warren, Harris, or Biden.

# Copper Unconsolidated

&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted the recent price action of copper. Over the past several months, copper had been consistently moving lower in a solid downtrend, but that downtrend has been broken this week. Finishing up about 1% in yesterday's session, copper had its first close above resistance which would suggest a further move higher. We're seeing additional gains today as the commodity continues to break out. Over the next few weeks, copper bulls will look for a series of higher highs and higher lows that would eventually form a new uptrend.

# best and WORST S&amp;P 1500 Stocks Since 9/6

&gt; This week has been all about little is big and big is little in terms of stock performance. Take the lists of best and worst performing S&amp;P 1500 stocks since last Friday's close. The first table below shows the 20 best performing S&amp;P 1500 stocks since the close last Friday. The fact that there are more than 20 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that are up over 20% already this week is notable in itself. Even crazier, though, is that when you look at the share prices of these stocks, all but seven have current share prices of less than $5 per share even after their gains this week, and the average share price of the 20 stocks listed is just $7.42. Also, as we noted in an earlier post, it's not as if there are tons of stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 trading below $5 per share. Heading into today, there were only 55 and 54 of them were up on the week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091219-Best-Stocks.png))**

&gt; Turning to the list of losers so far this week, while there are more than 20 stocks that are up over 20%, not a single stock in the index is down 20% and only eight are down more than 10%. Besides the fact that the stocks listed below are down so far this week and the ones above are up, the other major and pretty consistent difference between the two lists is their share prices. As of today, the average price of the 20 biggest losers so far this week is $135.74 which is more than 18 times the average share price of the biggest week to date winners.

# Throw It All Out the Window

&gt; It's time to throw all those financial ""mumbo jumbo"" ratios out the window. That's right. You can take your P/E, P/B, P/S ratios and send them out packing with EV/EBITDA and the PEG ratio. While you're at it, why don't you free up some space and toss out all those finance textbooks you bought in college and grad school. None of it matters. At least not this week where making money in the market has been as simple as ""buy low and sell high.""

&gt; Through yesterday's close, the S&amp;P 1500, which is comprised of large-caps (S&amp;P 500), mid-caps (S&amp;P 400), and small-caps (S&amp;P 600), was up just under 1% on the week. The average week to date performance of individual stocks in the index, however, was a much more impressive gain of 5%. By far the biggest gains have come from the stocks with the lowest share prices. Coming into the week, there were 55 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that had share prices of less than $5, and through Wednesday's close, they were up an average of 21% with 54 of 55 in the black. 21%!!!! Coming into today, there were also seven stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that were already up over 40% this week, and guess what? They all came into the week with share prices below $5.

&gt; Looking at the performance of individual stocks this week shows that share prices appear to have been a key driver of performance. In the chart below, we grouped stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 based on their share prices as of last Friday and then calculated the average performance of the stocks in each group so far this week (through Wednesday's close). While stocks with share prices of less than $5 per share were up an average of 20.8%, the performance of stocks priced between $5 and $10 per share were up a still impressive 10.9%. What's even crazier about this chart is the fact that as you move out to the right (higher share prices), average performance consistently weakens to the point where stocks with high share prices ($100+) have only gained an average of 0.1% so far this week. Who needs Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMAZN) and Chipotle (CMG) when you could have had JC Penney (JCP), Dean Foods (DF), or Mallinckrodt (MNK). If these high priced stocks know what's good for them, they better start announcing 10-1 splits pronto! (That was a joke.)

&gt; In all seriousness, the performance numbers listed below further illustrate this week's massive rotation out of momentum strategies, where stocks and sectors that had been leading have been sold off while those that had lagged or been written off for dead have seen some buying interest or at least an easing of selling pressure. All the textbooks and financial ratios in the world may provide comfort to analysts and investors, but they don't help at all when the momentum tide turns.

# Small Cap Surge

&gt; Small caps have been serial underperformers versus the large-cap S&amp;P 500 over the last 12+ months, but they're having their day in the sun this week. Not only has the small-cap Russell 2,000 risen more than 1% for three consecutive trading days to start the week, but the index has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than one percentage point on each of the last three days.

&gt; If this is the start of a longer-term small cap resurgence, there is certainly a lot of runway left. Below is a chart of the ratio between the S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2,000 over the last 15 years. When the line is rising, the S&amp;P is outperforming the Russell. When the line is falling, the Russell is outperforming the S&amp;P.

&gt; As you can see in the chart, the S&amp;P has been outperforming the Russell for the last year, and the ratio got extended to the very top of its 15-year range at the start of September. Since peaking earlier this month, however, the ratio has fallen dramatically as small caps have started to outperform. Even after the recent small-cap outperformance, the ratio remains well above its long-term average.

# Time For Gold To Shine?

&gt; “The higher the base, the higher in space,” is an old technical analysis saying.

&gt; Gold is up 18% year-to-date (as of 9/10/2019), poised for its best year since 2010, when it gained 30%. We see many reasons why this rally may have legs.

&gt; Last year’s action was rare: The S&amp;P 500 Index, 10-year U.S. Treasuries, and gold were all lower. Going back to 1971, when gold was officially removed from the gold standard, last year was the first year that all three assets were lower in a calendar year. Now in 2019, all three assets are up significantly, quite a difference from last year!

&gt; Gold and stocks have trended the same way: Since 1980, stocks and gold both have risen in 19 of those 39 years, and both have fallen in only four years. Somewhat surprisingly, both were up more than 10% in eight of those years. Gold might be viewed as “defensive,” but history shows there can be times when both gold and stocks have had nice gains together.

&gt; “Gold is breaking out to new highs after doing nothing for years,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Concerns over the global slowdown, $17 trillion in negative yielding debt, inverted yield curves, and central banks stepping up their gold purchases have all pushed the yellow metal out of a picture-perfect base.”

&gt; Technicals support a rally: As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold completed a nice-looking six-year saucer bottom and broke out above previous resistance. As the quote at the start of the blog noted, when things base for years, the potential move can be quite explosive.

&gt; A well-deserved pullback may present an opportunity for suitable investors to add exposure in appropriate strategies.

# S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 16 September option expiration weeks

&gt; September’s option expiration week is up 62.2% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 56.8% of the time and 59.5% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last sixteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down six of the last seven since.

**Stockmarket**

The stock market edged up this week as continuing delays and compromises continued to emerge regarding the imposition of tariffs.  Tech stocks did experience a light sell off on Tuesday but, after large recent gains, it amounted to a minor correction at worst and was largely reversed by the close on Friday.

**Small Caps**

1.Aspen Group, the online university, jumped on Tuesday after the company reported a 43% increase in quarterly revenue.  Growth has really taken off since 2017 when the college offered an affordable monthly fee for nurses wishing to qualify for their online Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) masters degree. Pricing it 30%-40% cheaper than alternatives, growth in enrollments has been massive.  That’s understandable given the average increase in a nurse's salary is greater than the cost of the degree itself. It also means that, on average, the degrees pay for themselves within one year.  Valued at just three times trailing revenues the stock looks cheap 

2. Funko, the leading producer of pop culture collectibles, finished the week up 16% after analysts following GameStop took great comfort from GamesStop CFO’s comments that;

“Our collectibles business is a great example. It continues to positively expand, posting a 21% year-over-year increase in the second quarter exceeding our expectations and marking the 15th consecutive quarter of growth with 14 out of the 15 in double digits.”

Short of naming Funko by name that clearly indicated Funko is having another great quarter.  What is less apparent is why investors needed reassurance.  Funko announced a considerable beat and raise only a few weeks ago with revenues up 38% and full year EPS expected to increase 45%.  Funko has become the benchmark for pop culture popularity putting its distinctive stamp on almost every major franchise in popular culture, namely a series of small highly stylized, vaguely anime-looking figures that have become a retail sensation. The company now has more than 1,100 licenses, including Harry Potter, Avengers, Star Wars, Pokemon, My Little Pony and Spongebob Squarepants.  

Funko has also been branching out of collectibles and into apparel and gaming in recent years.  Most recently, makeup has become the latest line with the company noting the huge overlap between fans who love makeup and those who love to collect Funko Pops. 

All in all the current valuation at 22x current year EPS estimates looks very reasonable.

**Special Situations (China)**

3. Changyou.com ADS jumped 50% on Monday to $9.00 after Sohu offered $10 to buy out all remaining outstanding stock.  That still leaves potentially 11% upside for investors who want to buy in now.  Admittedly the offer is non-binding but is unlikely to be rejected as Sohu already has a controlling interest of 68% and 90% of the voting rights. Changyou, after all, was only spun off by Sohu ten years ago. An article in Fool.com says that it is possible that the Board, which consists of independent directors, could block the deal.  However, the Board is elected each year at the AGM so I would consider this to be highly unlikely.

**Pharmaceuticals**

4. Acadia Pharmaceuticals jumped 70% on Monday after pleasantly surprising analysts with blockbuster potential for its treatment (Pimavanserin) in dementia psychosis. A successful phase 3 result is obviously not equivalent to an approval but the news was well received given the expected $25,000 annual charge and 1.2 million potential patients.  Back of the envelope, that yields a potential TAM of $30bn compared to a market cap of $5.8 billion (as Friday’s close).  

**Large Caps**

5. One stock that suffered worse than other tech stocks during the week was Universal Display, the organic light emitting diodes (OLED) research company, which dropped 10% on Tuesday and finished the week 22% off 52 week highs after an analyst downgrade with a weaker smartphone outlook.  However the pullback looks like an opportunity for investors to back the huge opportunity that surrounds OLEDs in television and lighting.  Demand for OLEDs is expected to triple over the next 5 years and Universal Display owns patents on the most energy efficient OLED technologies.  The company will collect its royalties no matter who manufactures the OLEDs and, given its asset light and highly scalable business model, increasing revenues will likely lead to an exponential increase in profits.  That can be seen in consensus forecasts which point to a 55% increase in revenues this year while EPS should grow 120%. Consequently its valuation (even with a trailing PE of 75) doesn’t look particularly high. 

6. RH jumped 5% on Wednesday after the luxury lifestyle retailer reported a blow out quarter with second-quarter adjusted EPS of $3.20 increasing 60% yoy and beating forecasts by 19%. The company raised EPS guidance by 15% and now expects full year EPS of $10.65 at the midpoint (compared to $7.31 last year).  RH’s core business has been a big winner as it has focused on delivering the most favorable shopping experience while cutting under performing lines to boost margins.  RH thinks it can do more.  During the call CEO Gary Friedman said sales in California alone could almost double from $450 million today to $700 million-$800 million. A considerable amount for a company that generated sales of $2.2 billion in 2019. However the biggest opportunity is international growth with the UK alone potentially generating sales of $1.1 billion and total international sales estimated at four times the size of North America.  RH’s stock is up significantly over the past few years but, with the long term outlook for 8%-12% growth, the valuation (at 16x forecast 2019 earnings) does not look expensive.

**Insider Buying/Selling**

7. REV Group CEO Timothy Sullivan bought $0.5 million of stock on Wednesday, one week after the company reported a disappointing Q3 that saw the stock price drop 30%.  Mr Sullivan asserted then that business fundamentals remained strong with the exception of softness in the RV market.  That was backed up on Thursday when the company announced an $80 million bus order.  Sizeable for a company with a $650 million market capitalization. 

8. Finally, when the CEO sells $5 million of stock after the price has fallen 50% it sends a pretty negative signal to investors.  Thats what happened when Merit Medical Systems CEO and President Fred Lampropoulos offloaded stock on Tuesday.  He still holds about $27 million of stock but this is Mr Lampropoulos’ second sale since the company reported a second quarter miss and cut guidance.  The outlook isn’t good. 

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.

How does the price of a stock really go up and down in price? So lets say a new stock becomes public and there's 100,000 shares and it's set at $10 (Side question I suppose, how is it that one stock has X shares and starts at Y price while another stock has different available shares and starts at a different price). I'm the first in line and I buy some share at $10. Based on this, does the price of the stock go up? If the answer to this is yes, hypothetically, can't I just instantly sell the shares and make a profit? If the answer is no, what makes the price go up? And does this mean that as long as no one is re-selling their bought stock, everyone next in line can buy the stock at $10 a pop till they fully run out of shares?

I get that there's supply and demand, but I don't quite understand how the value of the stock is determined. Like in my previous example, as soon as I buy the stock which is set at $10 what happens next? Does the stock go up for the next person waiting to buy in line, does that person also get it at $10?

The rising tide  of gold prices, which have remained at the $1,500 per ounce level (or  higher), only partially explains the keener investor attention Galane  has attracted. Galane’s current stock price has found a new plateau of  about $0.07/share – almost 20% higher. But, there’s more upside,  considering the solid fundamentals. These fundamentals are, as the term  suggests, the very basics of any business: good and old-fashioned  production and sale of goods, otherwise known as revenue and earnings.

ast August 15, Galane issued its 2019 Q2  financials, which were full of important ‘fundamentals’ in the strictest  sense of the term. Focusing on the highlights, Galane produced 8,692  ounces of gold in and sold 8,700 ounces in the second quarter at an  average of $1,305/oz. The highlight, however, was the fact that Galane  secured $2.889 million in cash-flow from operating activities at its *Mupane*gold  mine: the most important gold producer in Botswana. At well over 8,600  ounces in the second quarter, Galane is well on its way to achieving (or  surpassing) its yearly gold production target of 32,000 ounces.  Moreover, in neighboring South Africa, Galane has launched production at  the revamped *Galaxy Project*, located in the Barberton Greenstone  Belt – host to some of the most prolific gold deposits in the world.  Greenstone Belt, as it happens’ is not just a name. It refers to a  well-known geological formation, known to be rich in mineral deposits  from silver to zinc. 

**Most notably, greenstone belts contain gold**.

Galane’s Galaxy covers some 58.6  km² of the Barberton Greenstone Belt and the company remains in track  to achieve full commercial production in mid-2020. Galane refurbished an  old facility and started to produce concentrate, achieving more than  initially expected, such that it has a target production of some 2,300 ounces  of payable gold (and at much higher prices than in the second quarter,  given current trends and higher global geopolitical and macroeconomic  uncertainty) to be produced by the end of 2019 from the Galaxy project.  Moreover, Galane believes it will be able to sustain an average annual  production of 25,000 ounces of gold at operating costs (cash cost per  ounce) lower than $800. Now, consider that gold prices will be some  $200/oz. higher in Q3 (and most likely in Q4) to better appreciate the  earnings potential of a gold miner such as Galane: at current production  levels alone, the gold price differential would add about $1.74 million  in cash-flow.  

Effectively, Galane  represents a largely de-risked proposition -involving well-known  orebodies, which have been mined since 1888 – for investors wanting to  take advantage of gold mining stocks, as the markets are showing ever  clearer signals of uncertainty and volatility. And the resource is quite  simply-there are no other words to describe it-huge. In fact, Galane is  surrounded by large scale neighbors such as Pan-African Resources,  which has produced annual amounts in the range of 90,000 to 95,000  ounces for years.Of course, what happened in  the past is not going to move the stock price in the future. But the  past does offer than adequate assurances that Galane will be in a  position to deliver results. It boasts orebodies, which the market  expects, and it has the infrastructure in place to boost production. In  2020, as Phase II of the project gets underway, Galane plans to double  the milling  (and a suitable mill has already been built) and mining  capacity. The additional costs needed to ramp-up operations will be  easily financed thanks to the higher earnings made possible by the  higher gold price. 

Galane has used modern technology and mining  techniques to refurbish two well-established mining operations,  respectively in Botswana and South Africa. Galane is not trying to find  adequate gold concentrations to define the best ore concentration zones:  Galane already has two proven resources and Galane has already started  to deliver revenues. This makes it a rare find in the junior space,  which is typically filled with ‘potential’ rather than real and ‘actual’  opportunity.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Been making great profit on all of these so far, but can't long term decide which to solely own and hold onto , I slowly study and switch between each one...

SLV allows 100% margin aka can own 200% of it, AGQ allows 66% margin aka can own 166% of it, and USLV allows 15%-25% margin roughly, of can own 115 to 125% of it, AG I am not sure how much you can own in margin but its not too much.

I am loving SLV for its fantastic volume in the tens of millions, and can hold tons of it 100% more in margin, and its a low price, but for example the other stocks / etfs seem to go up more.

I also talk about the different tools the spreadsheet has.

**ABOUT ME:**

Hi! I'm 19 years old and I'm from Quebec, Canada. I'm just a normal dude who is passionate about finance and I love to connect through Reddit! I'm pursuing an MBA. I don't do finance as my full-time job at the moment so it is more like a hobby. I'm from North America, so this spreadsheet is built for CAD and USD. You can change the exchange rates if needed. Those will automatically be updated. (For more info on the script see below) I'm also a huge fan of DGI (Dividend Growth Investing) and I love to keep tracking everything, and this is why I came up with this wonderful spreadsheet after a lot of work. I think this is a must to have for everyone here!

**WHAT DOES THE SPREADSHEET DO?**

I've created an automated spreadsheet that pulls information from google finance and gives me an overview of my current portfolio. It also converts my portfolio into different graphs that are updated automatically when reloading. All you have to do is type in the symbol and the amount and it works. Every quote is updated every 10 min. It then calculates if I made money or lost money and how big the stake of each position is compared to others. It is really helpful. With this spreadsheet, I can also see the outlook of my portfolio, future dividends, the evolution of my portfolio, my monthly income, and my growth.

Plus, the spreadsheet contains multiple tools you can use.

**TOOLS:**

*Profit Calculator-* help you to calculate the gross profit/shares, gross margin profit, and total profit by taking account of your transaction fees.

*Account Positions-* Useful for keeping track of your portfolio (Dividends, Buy Price, Cost basis, gain/loss, growth, gameplan, and weight with a portfolio outlook diagram)

*Account tracking-* I'm investing in a TFSA with my bank and by myself so it is important to keep track of my contributions. It can also provide information about your other accounts. (like a Roth IRA etc.)

*Gross Valuation of Companies-* Calculate the gross intrinsic value of a stock. Also, it calculates the discount and potential of the stock to see which stock is undervalued. (This is gross evaluation, you shouldn't make any financial decisions only based on this)

*Golden ETF Reloads-* Golden stock to reload with your dividends. I discuss my strategy more below.

*Buying Lists-* Your grocery list but for stock. (Base on MY criteria, stocks might not suit you)

*Golden rules-* Those are the rules that I follow. I think those are fundamental principles. You do what you want.

**THE SCRIPT:**

It is a basic script that will automatically update the share prices every 10 minutes. You need to accept it since it will update your stock quotes (**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Don't buy base on those prices since they can be delayed by 20 min even if you refresh the share price. See [this](https://www.google.com/googlefinance/disclaimer/) for more information) I won't have access to anything on your sheet. The script respects everything about the Global Data Privacy Policy. [Here is a screenshot of the script.](https://imgur.com/a/T0D0uYu)

**HOW TO USE:**

1-Make a copy and save it to your drive so you can edit it. (accept the automated script) Have fun with it.

2-Modify Currency (with the exchange rates). Simply modify the exchange rate inside the double quotation marks example: =GOOGLEFINANCE(""CURRENCY:CADUSD"")for the exchange cad to USD. You might need to adapt your spreadsheet manually if needed.

3-Type the symbols and values into the fields I marked in grey. Contributions have to be negative! (E.g. if you invested USD2000 you need to type in -2000)

4-Fill the monthly tracking tool. (More details below)

5-Delete all other rows you don’t need

???

6-Profit

**SETTING UP THE MONTHLY DIVIDEND TRACKER:**

1-Add/move enough rows as needed.

2-Click and drag the months and quarters data to the top

3-Fill the monthly dividend amount (=actual income you earned) and the portfolio value as of the month. (If you don’t know, start your tracking from today)

4-Adjust the range of data in your diagrams where needed. Track your 12 months for the total dividend forecast.

We created Haystak and are looking for Beta testers! Check it out at [https://haystak.ai/](https://haystak.ai/)

***It is completely free to use*** 

Check it out at https://haystak.ai/

**Situation**  
We worked in finance. We used tools for technical analysis every day when making investment and trading decisions.

**Complication**  
No existing technical analysis tools test the predictive power of price patterns when they form in the markets. Most people look for commonly accepted patterns, without knowing if they are valid or not. In reality, they typically rely on outdated theory and other people's opinion when making investment and trading decisions.

**Question**  
How do I evaluate the predictive power of current price movements?

**Solution**  
We decided to build Haystak - a tool that help me/you/us make investment and trading decisions and ultimately optimise our capital.

**How does it work?**

1. Pick a stock/FX pair/index/crypto pair
2. The Haystak Engine uses machine learning techniques to find the most similar historic patterns to today's, yesterday's, last week's, or the last two week's (the list goes on...) price movements
3. A Haystak similarity score is computed and displayed

&amp;#x200B;

I created an easy-to-follow tutorial a few weeks ago on how to create your own simple dividend stock portfolio spreadsheet using Google.

&amp;#x200B;

I did this for 2 reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 because I have been seeing YouTubers that are selling their portfolio tracking spreadsheets and I thought that people should just learn how to make their own rather than pay for it.

\#2 because someone asked me to make a video showing how I created mine.

&amp;#x200B;

So, take a gander if you want to learn how you can make your own (which is useful so that you can personalize it to your own tastes).

# Kambi

**Share Price History**

On the 8th of June 2014 Kambi closed trading at 35.40SEK. In a period of 6 months the share price rose dramatically from 52.50SEK on the 8th of October 2015 to 152.00SEK on the 17th of April 2016. From July 2016 up until July 2018 the share price was in decline and closed trading on the 23rd of July at 67.50SEK. Throughout 2018 and the beginning of 2019 the price continued to rise and closed on the 28th of October at a price of 250SEK. Since that massive peak the price has been dropping (with some small peaks along the way) and closed on the 1st of September at 165.00SEK.^(1)

**Analysis**

* 2016
   * The peak from the beginning of October 2016 was due in part to the agreement between Kambi &amp; Novomatic.^(2)
* 2017
   * In 2017 there was a constant decline in the share price even though deals were reached with 888 holdings^(3), 7777^(4) and a renewal with LeoVegas^(5), seemingly this was due to the big drop in profits (from 1.8m to 100k€) in Q2 in 2017.^(6)
* 2018
   * The ongoing raise between July 2018 and the beginning of 2019 is in part due to deals closed with Draftkings^(7), Global Gaming 555^(8), White hat gaming^(9), Parx^(10), and Kindred^(11).
* 2019
   * On the 21st of July Kambi’s share price was at its lowest in recent times at 130SEK, this seems to be in direct response to the news that DraftKings are looking to drop Kambi^(12).
   * Once a renewal was achieved with DraftKings^(13) the share price jumped up to 167SEK.

**Summary**

The share price has grown in the past 5 years 466% (35.40SEK – 165SEK) which is a large profit for original investors.

Based on the history of the past 5 years, Kambi’s share price is volatile and fluctuates based on deals with large clients and PR. Even mere news about signing or losing a client sends the price to move dramatically.

**Public Projection**

In recent publications and reviews Kambi Group Plc stocks are predicted to continue to raise in the coming years and are considered a reasonable safe investment^(14).

# Our Investigation

**Customers leaving**

* &amp;#x200B;

1. Kambi’s deal with Novomatic up to date is entirely functional and they haven’t signed any deals as a conjoined team, leading to believe that the peak in share price in 2016 was unfulfilled and incorrect.

* 2. Luckia left Kambi back in 2016, quoting ‘the new platform will provide a range of benefits to Luckia, including greater operational flexibility and improved price differentiation. It will also enable the operator to offer unique odds, set its own betting limits and payouts, customise content and marketing, and manage its sportsbook liability in real time^(15).
* 3. 888 Holdings in early 2019 purchased BetBright with a very clear vision of leaving Kambi and very recently announced that they will be in the near future using their own sportsbook.^(16)
* 4. Draftkings are looking to close to deal in buying out SBTech which would point to them dropping Kambi, this is despite them renewing a deal with Kambi^(17).
* 5. Inside reports from a reliable source in R Franco have told our research team that they are in the process of leaving Kambi and signing with another major supplier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Negative Press**

1. Kindred powered by Kambi have been placed on the blacklist in Switzerland^(18), pointing to illegal activity (Kindred are in deeply linked with Kambi - Kambi is B2B subsidiary of UniBet which is the original name of Kindred)^(19)

**Summary**

Looking at the final Quarter of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 the future doesn’t look bright for Kambi. Two of their biggest genuine clients (ignoring their spinoff Unibet) - DraftKings &amp; 888 Holdings are poised to quit, and add to the mix our reports that R Franco are looking to leave Kambi. These moves indicate that Kambi are a product big customers’ are afraid to rely on. In addition we see in other news that that they aren’t as squeaky clean as they proclaim they are.

Since Kambi is a company which its value is solely based on PR and clients, we strongly believe based on our extensive research, contrary to popular belief Kambi’s value is going to drop and its share price will be trading below 100SEK in the near future and continue to drop. If they lose Draftkings and 888 Holdings they will struggle to recover, as Draftkings is their main ticket into the United States.

**Advice**

Based on the analysis and predictions, our advice to our in-house brokers and advisors is to recommend selling Kambi shares and not to purchase. On the bright side, long term investors have earned tremendously from recent growth.

After a long period of double digit comp sales declines we achieved considerable sequential improvement in our comp sales in each month within the quarter. Gross margin was impacted by aggressive markdowns on poor performing legacy products that we accelerated within the quarter. However, we saw strong and better than expected sell through on new merchandise. Our merchant teams have done an excellent job of shifting back to a “read and react” buying and planning strategy, resulting in more nimble buying and planning processes. We believe effective implementation of this data analytic and customer demand strategy is driving a meaningful improvement in both boutique traffic and conversion during the second quarter.  We realized material savings this quarter through a number of cost reduction initiatives that we have been executing since the beginning of fiscal 2019.  In addition, we continue to make headway in optimizing our real estate portfolio.

My thoughts: I am not sure on the overlapping holdings on VT and VFDEF &amp; VOO. Honestly not sure if I should go with all three of them. Also not sure if I want to go with PYPL, V and MA all together or cut one and put the rest in the other two. I am also wondering when a good time would be to buy all the stocks and ETFs.  
  
For context: I am from Germany and 21 years old. This portfolio is meant more long term obviously. Also my first time investing, so I am trying not to run in any obvious traps.

The last update was clearly marked as today, Sept 9, 2019. I immediately thought ""I knew something was wrong! ...so why does my Robinhood account claim it is in the 20's??""

I then exited out of Marketwatch and checked Yahoo, and the price was the same as Robinhood (around $21.) So then I immediately went back into Marketwatch and, lo and behold, the price amount changed to the amount shown on Yahoo and in Robinhood.
Okay, so.... just a glitch perhaps??

However, this leads to my initial concern, and my reason for deciding to check the price outside of my Robinhood app in the first place...

My average purchase price is currently (and has always been) higher than the 52 week high -- and I haven't even owned this stock for 52 weeks. Also, my highest purchase price from back in October 2018 (when I first bought the stock) is WELL OVER the highest recorded cost of this stock over the last 5 years. There is no record of it ever reaching any higher than the amount I originally purchased it for so how is that possible?


To be more specific, the stock chart shows it's peak at $28.04 back in May ...
BUT my purchase price back in October 2018 was over $44. 
Then it was $39 in November, $36 in December, and $33 in January.
And then, there was even a cancelled purchase (thank god) for $51.25 (!!) in May of this year.

Again, how is any of this possible?? What am I missing here? Is Robinhood just ripping me off? Because I dont understand how this is possible if the stock never even reached those prices.

Elsewhere, Cidara jumped on Tuesday after announcing a commercialization deal with Mundipharma that will provide an upfront payment of $30 million and equity investment of $9 million in return for exclusive rights to develop and commercialize rezafungin in all markets outside of the United States and Japan.  Total royalty streams could exceed $568 million making Cidara’s market cap of $44 million look like a bargain.

The Medicine Company also jumped after reporting successful Phase 3 trials with its novel new anti-cholesterol drug (the can be taken as a bi-annual injection) reporting a 54% drop in bad cholesterol with no significant side effects.  MDCO has a market cap of $3.3 billion versus projected peak sales of $2 billion but that could be underestimating the opportunity given western (and global) lifestyles creating a fast growing TAM of about $30 billion.

InMode, the medical company that offers minimally-invasive aesthetic medical products for procedures such as liposuction, rose 20% as bullish analysts raised price targets.  The stock doesnt look expensive (with a valuation of just 3.5 times trailing sales for a company growing at 50%) but I worry about how replicable the model is by competitors and note that all the analysts raising guidance seem to have been quite closely involved in the recent IPO.

Amerian Eagle Outfitters saw its stock drop sharply before recovering most of its losses by the end of the week.  The market’s reaction seems more inexplicable given AEO beat analyst expectations across the board and reported its 18th consecutive quarter of comp growth.  TTM PE 10.50 looks cheap.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 9th, 2019.

# **Stocks look to reclaim their all-time highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/stocks-look-to-reclaim-their-all-time-highs-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks will look to build on their strong recent momentum and reclaim their record highs next week amid a slew of economic data while trade war fears decrease.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is about 1.6% from an intraday record reached on July 26 after notching back-to-back weekly gains. The broad index is up 1.8% this past week after surging 2.8% in the last week of August.
*****
&gt; Wall Street’s move toward all-time highs comes as recent U.S. economic data suggests a recession may not be in the cards, and the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this month. Easing fears around the U.S.-China trade war are also lifting investor sentiment. If the data remains solid, Fed rate cut expectations stay high and U.S.-China trade tensions lower, the market could climb back to all-time highs.
*****
&gt; “You cannot sell the market ahead of the Fed and you cannot sell the market ahead of the trade talks in October,” Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a CNBC contributor, told “Power Lunch.” “For now, it’s a bull run.”
*****
&gt; The U.S. services sector grew at a faster rate than expected in August, the Institute for Supply Management said Thursday. The data offset worries from the manufacturing sector. The ISM said Tuesday that the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first time since early 2016.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the Labor Department on Friday reported better-than-expected U.S. wage growth for August at a time when consumer spending is strong. However, the report also showed jobs growth slowed for a third straight month.
*****
&gt; “The U.S. economy should avoid recession,” Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote in a note. “With slower, but still-solid job gains and good wage growth, households will continue to spend; consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy.”
*****
&gt; Investors will get more information on the state of the consumer next Friday with the release of August retail sales and a preliminary look at September consumer sentiment. Positive data on that front could lift stocks to their records.
*****
&gt; Next week will be important as investors get more clues about the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. August readings for the producer and consumer price indexes are scheduled for release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Fed has cited persistently low inflation as one of the reasons for easing monetary policy in the U.S. In July, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points. Market expectations for another quarter-point rate trim in September are at 93.5%, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; However, stronger-than-expected inflation could raise questions about whether the Fed will reduce rates later this month.
*****
&gt; “Anything that is speaking directly to inflation is going to be most important” for the market, said James Masserio, co-head of equities in the Americas at Societe Generale. “That’s going to be weighted most heavily in the central bank’s monetary policy decision-making process.”
*****
&gt; “Right now, all asset classes are being greatly influenced by the expectations of changes in monetary policy,” Masserio said.
*****
&gt; The Fed is not slated to meet until the week of Sept. 17, but the European Central Bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. The ECB is largely expected to cut rates with some experts forecasting a restart to its quantitative easing program.
*****
&gt; News around U.S.-China trade talks will continue to play a role in the market next week as investors look for signs of progress in the negotiations. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said Chinese trade officials will meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington next month.
*****
&gt; “If there’s a bit more optimism around trade, I think we could get back to those previous highs,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “We’re not far from the previous highs. It wouldn’t take much to get there.”

# Meager “Worst Months” Gains Still the Norm in Pre-Election Years

&gt; With a little more than four months of DJIA’s and S&amp;P 500 “Worst Six Months” already completed, the markets performance thus far has been lackluster and in line with historical averages. NASDAQ’s “Worst Four Months” (July through October) has been similar to DJIA and S&amp;P 500. From the close on April 30 through yesterday’s close, DJIA gained just 0.51%, S&amp;P 500 1.02%. From the end of June NASDAQ has gained 1.38%.

&gt; These are rather slim returns for the amount of time. And this excludes the volatility the market experienced in May and again in August. At their respective lows during late May and early June DJIA and S&amp;P 500 were down over 6%. At the August low, NASDAQ was off nearly 3.5%. Our Seasonal Switching Strategy exited DJIA and S&amp;P 500 positions on May 2 and rotated into bond positions. Those bond positions were up an average of 10.1%, excluding dividends on September 4.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 9/6/19

&gt; Despite a shortened week from the Labor Day holiday, there was a heavy slate of economic data with a total of 30 releases. Half of these came in better than estimates or the prior period's reading while another 13 missed or weakened. Three indicators were in line with estimates. There was a lot of manufacturing data this week including readings from Markit and the ISM, Factory Orders, Durable Goods, and Capital Goods. The ISM reading was the most strikingly negative of these as it showed a contractionary reading. The ISM and Markit service counterparts, on the other hand, showed healthier levels, but the Markit PMI did miss estimates. Labor data also was a major focus this week and the overall results were pretty mixed. ISM employment, initial jobless claims, and today's NFP report all disappointed, but the ADP employment change, continuing claims, and labor force participation rate came in stronger than expected. Similarly, each indicator for wages including quarterly unit labor costs and average earnings showed improvements.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090619-Eco.png))**

&gt; It will be slightly less busy next week with only 24 releases scheduled. Following up on this week's labor data, the JOLTS report is due out Tuesday morning and is expected to show fewer job openings than June. Inflation indicators like PPI, CPI, and export and import prices make up a considerable portion of next week's data. Core estimates for both PPI and CPI are forecasted to show higher price inflation in August. In addition to preliminary consumer sentiment, on Friday we will also get a reading on retail sales for August. For both core and headline readings, this indicator is expected to slow significantly MoM compared to July.

# Economic Surprise Index Turns Positive

&gt; When it comes to economic reports, one trend that has seemingly been in place all year is that the vast majority of data points have come in short of expectations. The fact that economic momentum has been slowing is one thing, but when the economy consistently comes up short relative to expectations, it sets a tone that things are quickly deteriorating. That's never a good thing, but thankfully, there are signs that the tide is turning.

&gt; The Citi Economic Surprise Index measures the pace at which economic indicators are coming in ahead of or below consensus forecasts. When the index is negative, it means that the majority of reports are coming in below expectations, while a positive reading indicates that most data is coming in ahead of expectations. The chart below shows the index going back to 2003, and the parts where the line is red indicate periods where the index was negative for at least 100 trading days. The most recent period of negative readings was one of the longest ever at 140 trading days and just the 6th streak of 100 or more trading days (during the period from 2015 to 2016 there were actually two separate streaks although it looks like just one long streak in the chart). The fact that this index is now positive indicates that economists have finally ratcheted down estimates enough to be in line with actual conditions on the ground.

# Sentiment Back to Normal

&gt; Bullish investor sentiment as measured by AAII's sentiment survey rose 2.5 percentage points to 28.64% this week. While this is an improvement, bullish sentiment is still in the 18th percentile of the data over the past decade. We must also note that the survey would not have captured any benefit from today's news on the trade front and the technical breakout of stocks and other assets like crude oil. Save a tweet or a headline reversing what appears to be optimism given today's positive price action, we'll likely see a bigger jump in bullish sentiment next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bullish.png))**

&gt; Bulls borrowed from the bears this week as bearish sentiment fell from 42.2% last week to 39.5%. As with bullish sentiment, this is not necessarily a dramatic improvement as it is still higher than 83% of weeks over the past 10 years. Bearish sentiment also remains the predominant sentiment level among investors as the bull-bear spread is still fairly wide at -10.87 percentage points. Granted, that is the narrowest spread since the last week of July when it was only 28 bps in favor of bears.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bearish.png))**

&gt; The bulk of the loss in bearish sentiment went to bulls, but a small portion also went to the neutral camp as the percentage of investors reporting as neutral grew to 31.9%. While bullish sentiment is still several percentage points below its historical average and the opposite applying to bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment has been pulling back to its historical average over the past few months. Where it currently sits at 31.9%, it is only 0.33% from that average.

# ISM Services Shows Little Pressure in Inflation

&gt; Following Tuesday's ISM Manufacturing report, we noted the extremely low reading in the monthly ISM Commodities Survey, which measures the number of commodities rising and falling in price. After today's report for the Non-Manufacturing sector, that trend remained in place. In this morning's report, respondents noted price increases in just 6 commodities and decreases in 4. That net reading of +2 is the weakest reading since January. Combining the results of both reports, in August we saw a total of just 8 commodities up in price and 15 lower. That reading of negative 7 was the lowest since February 2016, while the three-month moving average of -4.0 was the lowest since April 2016.

&gt; As we noted on Tuesday, low readings in the commodities survey usually track the direction of inflation readings pretty closely and would imply that the current y/y reading of 1.8% in CPI will see downward pressure in the months ahead. For example, in the eight prior months where the three-month moving average in the combined reading was between zero and negative five, the average y/y reading in CPI was +0.45% while the median level was +0.65%.

# Low P/E, Low Return

&gt; Most investors are trying to forget about August performance as quickly as possible, but we wanted to highlight a noteworthy data set about the month before it gets too far into the rear-view mirror. At the end of every month, we run our decile analysis of the S&amp;P 500 to see which stock characteristics drove performance the most. One characteristic we look at is valuation, and in August, valuations played a big role in performance.

&gt; Below we've broken up the S&amp;P 500 into deciles based on P/E ratios (trailing 12-month). Decile 1 contains the 50 stocks in the S&amp;P with the lowest P/Es at the start of August, while decile 10 contains the 50 stocks in the index with the highest (or negative) P/Es. Each bar in the chart shows the average percentage change in August of the 50 stocks in each decile.

&gt; As shown, the 50 stocks in the S&amp;P with the lowest P/E ratios at the start of the month fell an average of 11.5% in August! The next two deciles with the lowest P/E ratios fell more than 5% as well. On the other end of the spectrum, the 50 stocks with the highest P/E ratios fell only 0.78% in August.

&gt; You've certainly heard a lot about the ""death of value investing"" recently, and this is why! We have to think that at some point the scales will tip and head in the other direction.

# Down August, Up YTD, No Worries

&gt; Now that the very volatile month of August has finished on the downside folks are concerned about the other worst month, September, and for good reason. Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year. However, while August was negative this year with the market still up year-to-date the prospects for Q4 and the year as a whole are not so ominous. In fact, it’s kind of bullish.

&gt; Early last month we relayed the historical data on August declines being quite commonplace though overall, years with August declines were quite choppy and not especially bullish. However when the market was up year-to-date at the end of August despite an August decline the picture changes dramatically. In the tables here you can see that after some extended volatility and negativity in September Q4 and the year as a whole has been rather positive.

&gt; Since 1949 in years the market was up YTD in August but down for the month DJIA was up in September 56.3% of the time (9 of 16) with an average gain of 0.76%, up in Q4 81.3% of the time (13 of 16) with an average gain of 5.68% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 17.43%.

&gt; The S&amp;P has a similar record up 58.8% of the time in September (10 of 17) with an average gain of 0.81%, up in Q4 94.1% of the time with an average gain of 5.73% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 20.21%.

&gt; Since 1971 NASDAQ was up in September 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 0.35%, up in Q4 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 4.04% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 21.72%. NASDAQ was hit much harder in the 1983 bear market and 1997 Asian Financial Crisis than the much larger cap (at the time) DJIA and S&amp;P.

I thought that because they have been around for so long, they must know what they are doing.

I was surprised when the stock recently took a huge dip, because their income is apparently diminishing. I also found out that their payout ratio is over 233% according to Google Finance, meaning they pay over twice as much in dividend as the profit they are generating.

My questions are:
1. How did they get into a position where their income is diminishing? It seems that should almost never happen to a utility.
2. The payout ratio seems highly unsustainable. Is there any way for them out of this? Again, how did they get in this position? It seems incredibly stupid.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

How do investors find out a companies earnings before the company reportedly is going to release them?

There were articles written 10 minutes past 4 with all the information. How did all of these people find out the earnings if Lululemon was set to report them at 4:30?

&gt; ***Hi r/stocks! I am just putting out next week's most anticipated earnings calendar a day earlier than usual due to not being able to get around to do this tomorrow or this weekend. I really don't like to post these up any earlier than Friday's because sometimes the calendars can look a bit wonky where you might see some companies on the calendar that are actually not scheduled to report, or are reporting on another day, etc etc. but unfortunately I don't really have much of an option here...it's either putting this up now or no earnings thread at all for next week. Anyway, please do me this favor everyone and review carefully the companies that are scheduled to report on their respective days for next week. Admittedly, I did not get a chance to confirm all the companies that are on this week's calendar are actually reporting, but if you see something that doesn't look right, as far as a company that is listed up on this calendar on a particular day that isn't expected to report, please just post a little notice in this thread so that everyone is made aware of it! I'd greatly appreciate that. It's very possible that there are some company logos on this calendar that are misplaced here. FWIW, I do not create these calendars. These are coming straight from EW (Earnings Whispers). Thank you!***

I currently have around 5k of EA stock in my portfolio and have 10k to spend. I really like the look of Microsoft and Disney. Microsoft for what they are doing with cloud, Disney for what I think disney+ could become. 

Are these companies overvalued currently? Is it a good time to buy? I don't want to fall into that cycle of waiting for stocks to go down before purchasing. I have done my own valuations using DFC's and I feel they are both trading at a slight premium. I could be wrong. Please let me know if you think I should go into this and split 50/50 between Disney and miicrosoft, or if i should look into any other companies. 

I also like the look of Salesforce, shorting slack + we work, fitbit, amgen and finally medmen (if they can minimize operational costs.

High dividend yield (~24% per Fidelity)

Argentina's economy is in shambles yet again
The peso is/was losing value
Political turmoil in the country atm

TGS produces and delivers natural gas in Argentina.  From what I've read, it's the country's leading company in this field.  So it seems stable.  What has me on the fence with pulling the trigger on a buy is the polictical/economic uncertainty.  Argentina's market has been in and out of recessions for several years now, and I haven't found any clear cut news articles on how long they have been in their current one.  So I can't gauge if a turnaround is likely yet or not.

There is also no way to tell how thier upcoming election will play out.  The current president lost a primary election by a landslide which sent the market to the floor, taking $TGS with it.  The election is this October, so there is still time for the market to swing as it will over there.

I also don't know how a recession or full on Argentinian default would really effect a company like TGS.  In one of the news articles I read a family was interviewed on how they're adjusting to the overall downfall in the economy.  One lady said she switched her car to run on natural gas instead of petrol to save money.  If this is a common thing going on right now over there, then TGS is going to continue making money in these rough times.  

I've watched it fall down to $7.12 USD/share a few days ago all the way up to $8.22 at close today.  I'm going to keep an eye on it for the next week or so and see if it stays on the rise or drops back down again.  If it continues to rise it will be hard not to start a position, just don't want to get caught in another big drop after getting in too high (obviously).

Not only do I envision Uber breaking even sooner than expected, my thoughts trend toward Uber profiting massively after scaling the divisions that eventually become profitable and trimming those that do not.  Specifically, I am referring to Uber ride sharing, Uber Eats, and Uber Freight.  

Uber ride sharing – yes, this division isn’t currently profitable but let’s do the math. With over 91 million active riders and 14 million trips per day, gradual price increases or take rates will result in profit.  For example, raising rides by $1 would equate to:  $1 x 14,000,000 x 365 = $5.1 Billion dollars in additional profit.  That’s right, $5 Billion with a capital B.  In addition, Uber could up-sell each trip with in-ride entertainment, in-ride advertisements, optional city tours for travelers, show reservations, etc.  With 14 million active riders per day, small and gradual adjustments could make a huge impact to the bottom line.

Uber Eats and Uber Freight fall into the company’s “Other Bets” segment.  Their S-1 filing explains “""Other Bets revenue increased to $373 million in 2018 compared to $67 million in 2017. This increase was primarily related to the expansion of our Uber Freight offering,"" reads the filing. “

In 2018, Uber generated $1.46 billion from Uber Eats, up 148.7% from the previous year. Uber Eats now makes up 17.3% of Uber's overall revenue. The company's gross bookings from Uber Eats grew 108% YoY to $3.07 billion.

An Oppenheimer &amp; Co. research note projected that Uber Freight would capture 6.1% of the U.S. truck brokerage market by 2029, generating around $12 billion in gross revenue in a market estimated to be worth $117 billion.

The growth rate for both Uber Eats and Uber Freight is impressive.  It’s clear that Uber is heavily investing in both to acquire market share and expand.  It will take time and it will cost money.  Just like with Uber ride sharing, gradual adjustments in prices, take rates, up-sell opportunities, and increasing operating efficiency will result in profit. 

I skipped the whole autonomous vehicle idea deliberately as it is not relevant.  Uber doesn’t need autonomous vehicles to become profitable.  Taxis have been profitable for decades.  Freight companies have been profitable for decades. Medical transportation companies have been profitable for decades (similar to Uber Health).  

Uber is growing to acquire market share.  As the dials turn behind the scenes according to Dara Khosrowshahi’s leadership, the company will become profitable. That will only be the beginning of the transportation revolution.

Some examples:

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/tailored-brands-stock-suits-casual-51553200454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tailored-brands-stock-suits-casual-51553200454)

[https://nypost.com/2019/03/14/mens-wearhouse-parent-sees-shares-tumble-as-office-attire-becomes-more-casual/](https://nypost.com/2019/03/14/mens-wearhouse-parent-sees-shares-tumble-as-office-attire-becomes-more-casual/)

It's a compelling narrative so long -- as one does not check the numbers. YTD, $TLRD's stock has dropped a whopping 60.8% compared to the retail sector's -8.81%.

But as you may know, Michael Burry recently assumed an activist position in $TLRD: [http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13622252&amp;RcvdDate=8/30/2019&amp;CoName=TAILORED%20BRANDS%20INC&amp;FormType=SC%2013D&amp;View=html](http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13622252&amp;RcvdDate=8/30/2019&amp;CoName=TAILORED%20BRANDS%20INC&amp;FormType=SC%2013D&amp;View=html). So what gives?

\- Suits and tuxedos are not going away. There will always be weddings, funerals, lawyers, proms, various black tie events, etc. Much has been made of the workplace casual trend. So the question is, how much demand did the workplace drive relative to these other uses for suits? Perhaps not as much as people think. Check out TLRD's numbers. Retail sales held steady, and retail gross margins increased from 2016-2018, against the backdrop of increasing workplace casual. In fact, the trend towards workplace casual has been alive about a decade now, yet MW saw growth throughout much of the decade. So are fluctuations in sales numbers really driven by the workplace casual trend, or are there other more dominant factors? (An SA article came out recently w/ these numbers.)

\- Once you believe that demand for formalwear is here to stay. Then you realize that the trend in TLRD's stock price is very overblown. It's trading like demand for suits is going to drop off a cliff and therefore TLRD is going bankrupt. However, the reality is that TLRD is a cash flow machine.

But that turn is not near sharp enough for the FDA, which has issued a second complete response letter (CRL) for the Lantus competitor Biocon developed with Mylan. 

Biocon announced over the weekend that the FDA had issued the CRL to Mylan for the drug approval “pending completion” of improvements at Biocon’s facilities in Malaysia. It was not a big surprise given that the FDA tallied a dozen issues at the three facilities that comprise the manufacturing operation for the drug during a preapproval inspection in June.

“The CRL did not identify any outstanding scientific issues with the application,” Biocon said (PDF) in a public filing. “We remain confident of the quality of our application and do not anticipate any impact of this CRL on the commercial launch timing of our Insulin Glargine in the U.S.”

RELATED: No surprise: FDA hits Mylan and Biocon with CRL for their follow-on copy of Lantus

The whole episode is deja vu for Biocon and Mylan, which received a CRL for the product in June 2018 following an earlier preapproval inspection. In that case, the FDA asked for additional clinical data to support a request to manufacture the insulin injectors at the Malaysia facility instead of at a plant in Bangalore, India, that has had its own issues. 

Biocon and Mylan have won approval of their drug, branded Semglee, in Europe and already launched it in England, but it competes in those markets with copies from Eli Lilly and Merck &amp; Co. 

While the further U.S. delay is a setback for Biocon and Mylan, it doesn’t mean much for Sanofi. That’s because sales of the French drugmaker’s top-selling drug have already been badly eroded by significant price discounting and by competition from Basaglar, the Lantus biosimilar Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim launched in the U.S. in 2016.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.
