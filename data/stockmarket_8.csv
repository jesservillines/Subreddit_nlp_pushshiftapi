Apple has just hit an incredible milestone. You may have guessed it. Yes, it became the first [tech stock](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing/tech-stocks) to pass the $2 trillion mark. This comes ahead of a 4-for-1 stock split that will lower the entry barrier for prospective investors to buy shares. The iPhone maker has beaten the other tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft to reach this milestone. Of course, this is a largely symbolic figure. There’s nothing significant changing fundamentally. But the bottom line is that Apple is doing very, very well. Maybe you are like many other investors who are contemplating whether to [buy AAPL stock now](https://stockmarket.com/featured/apple-heres-how-it-could-impact-your-investments-2020-08-13). Let’s take a closer look at what’s ahead for the iPhone maker and why the growth is here to stay.

## Ongoing Transition To 5G Network To Give AAPL Stock A Boost

One of the key drivers in Apple stock growth would be the next-generation 5G mobile technology. Technology analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush said that “Apple has a ‘once in a decade’ opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months as we estimate roughly 350 million of Cupertino’s 950 million iPhones worldwide are in the window of an upgrade opportunity.”

Many experts believe the new 5G iPhone would be a game-changer and it will be a defining chapter for the world’s largest tech company. Apple is slated to launch iPhone 12 in October. The question is, how important is the iPhone 12 to Apple? Ives said that Wedbush believes that many on Wall Street “are underestimating the massive pent-up demand around this super cycle for Apple, which remains the opportunity for the bulls.”

## Apple Services &amp; Wearables Segment Continues To Outperform

Even though the novel coronavirus continues to persist in the second quarter, Apple was able to generate growth, with revenue that increased by 1%. For the fiscal third quarter, Apple produced a record, with revenue up 11% year over year, while earnings per share grew 18%. This came amid the strong performance among tech companies. And investors have certainly been piling into tech companies that benefited during the stay-at-home orders. These include companies with products and services related to remote work, cloud computing, music, and video streaming, and digital payments, among others. 

That’s not to say when the pandemic is over, the services segment would drop. In fact, before the pandemic, services have already recorded strong growth. Wearables such as AirPods and Apple Watch have also recorded strong growth. They could see a higher number of unit sales in the next quarter.

The pandemic only served as a catalyst to boost AAPL stock higher when the hardware sales were recording slower growth. As a matter of fact, the pandemic actually played to Apple’s strengths. The company saw Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+ and the App Store all performing better during the lockdown. 

## Is Apple Stock To Buy?

Apple is likely to see increasing retail demand for AAPL stock after the stock split. The company is able to leverage its massive user base to drive strong growth in its services and wearables segment. The highly anticipated first 5G iPhone will likely whet the appetite of iPhone stalwarts globally. These are some of the few areas investors might want to pay attention to see if AAPL can reach the $3 trillion mark in the near to medium term. With all these in mind, is it any surprise to say that Apple is still one of the [best tech stocks to buy](https://stockmarket.com/investing/looking-for-best-tech-stocks-to-buy-2-to-watch-right-now-2020-07-16)?",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,502936,public,confidence,self,"Apple Hits $2 Trillion Market Cap, Is AAPL Stock Still A Buy?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/idfm4b/apple_hits_2_trillion_market_cap_is_aapl_stock/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'k-CKp3wIh0hCxtWWaAoorpgpK5ZqEUSrGUaJ1uG-3wU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 11, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27594d395f3315b951ace2fad82d1ee6afd17085', 'width': 108}, {'height': 23, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14f2795e52c81fb604aa512af51c9e8a61b2546c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 35, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99552db7d3eb3da6bc14b4b58cec31dceadc66f6', 'width': 320}, {'height': 70, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=109989fea44209a977a2514783ea70ef64589997', 'width': 640}, {'height': 105, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1bf68bd8e68c369ceed723204aea1660a2755dd', 'width': 960}, {'height': 118, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1007a781274d6409b90b6efe4e9377379872d19b', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 195, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=526c8d12ad23c681526ba64357050fe7e8eb6fa4', 'width': 1779}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lyft will suspend service in California at 11:59 Pacific Time Thursday after a court granted a preliminary injunction last week requiring it to reclassify drivers as employees, the company said in a blog post.

Top executives at Uber and Lyft warned last week they would likely have to suspend their ride-hailing services to comply with the court order, which would involve them restructuring their operations and re-hiring workers.

Just joined this sub and just downloaded the Robin Hood app with $500 in funding. 

Like many people, thanks to pandemic, I’ve been unemployed and basically saving every penny from UE but I know it won’t last forever. Unfortunately I’m not in a position to move back home and save even more by not having to pay rent and other COL in NYC. Since I can’t find work in my industry (beauty), I have to look at other alternatives. 

Im a 33F who knows next to nothing about stocks, more so terminology. I did navigate the app and read the tips and what not. Can any stock genius out there give me some tips/advise that aren’t obvious? I know $500 is chump change for a lot of people but it’s a lot for me, and It’ll sucks to lose another $500 but I won’t be homeless over it. I’d rather spend $500 learning how to make it grow than spend it on take out and clothes I can’t wear, I’d be happy even I could make $250 return. I look at is as an educational investment - if you will
. 

I’d like to know what red/green flags I should look for, what limits to set etc, just basically investing 101 for dummies...or if someone could link me a reputable guide I can read? 

Any tips/advise would be great!

Looking at the Stocksplit history - Microsoft did its last Split ( 2-1 ) back in 2003 , always trying to hold the stockprice under 100 $ . ( Stockprices now : ~210$) 

Microsoft has ~ 7,5 billion stocks outstanding  , after a 2-1 it would be arround 15 billion 

—Compared to Apple—

Apple has ~ 4,3 billion stocks outstanding , leading it to a 17 billion stocks outstanding after the split

_________

A reason for me that microsoft hasnt announced anything yet , might be the planned acqusition of tiktok. If they are sure they can accomplish the deal , they have more potential „buyers“ which would lead to a potential Split.

I would love to hear about your opinion on this one !

Some extracts:

According to the popular *market cap to GDP ratio*, the U.S. stock market, collectively, is about 77.0% overvalued. Despite the worst economic backdrop since the Great Depression, stocks have held up reasonably well since the March 23 bottom. While it’s true that the stock market has disconnected from the underlying economy, it has also done so in the past. With such an extreme level of overvaluation, it does beg the question, “Are we witnessing the formation of another bubble?”

**Stock Valuation-How it Works**

One of the more popular methods used to determine if U.S. stocks are undervalued or overvalued is the *market cap to GDP ratio*. This ratio compares the total market cap of all U.S. publicly traded stocks with GDP. More specifically, it calculates the total value of the outstanding shares of all U.S. domiciled, publicly traded companies (the numerator), and divides that number by total GDP. For example, if total market cap was $20 trillion and GDP was the same, stocks would be considered fairly valued (eg; $20 trillion / $20 trillion = 1 {ie; 100%}). During this pandemic, GDP has fallen while stocks (and market cap) have risen, creating the highest level of overvaluation since the ratio began in January 1971. This is another way of saying that stocks are extremely overbought.

It’s important to note that stocks can remain overvalued for an extended period. However, at some point, stocks will fall (or GDP will rise), and the ratio will decline. While there is no way to be absolutely certain when this will occur, the ratio does offer insight.

Currently, the degree of overvaluation is around 77.6% (177.6% – 100% = 77.6%). The previous record high was 49.3% on January 26, 2018. Prior to that, the highest reading was 49.0% overvalued in March 2000, just as the Tech Bubble burst.

Why was the ratio so low during the 1980s when stocks soared? Although stocks rose mightily during the decade, GDP was strong, which kept valuations from rising too much. Plus, when Reagan took office, stocks were more than 50% *undervalued*. While getting inflation down to a manageable level, Reagan began to deregulate various industries and embarked on a series of tax cuts, all of which created a boom period for the economy and the stock market.

**What About Today?**

A cursory glance at the far right of the chart will reveal a massive 32.9% drop in GDP (bottom graph) and a rising stock market (middle graph). The combination of the two have created the record overvaluation. Though we know the economy is improving, we do not know if the improvement will be enough to bring the ratio down to a more comfortable level.

There are other factors contributing to the record overvaluation. Very few investment categories offer a good alternative to the stock market. Cash is paying next to nothing and bond yields are at historic lows. You could invest in gold and silver and some high-flying tech stocks but buying these after such an increase could prove risky. With a lack of alternatives, you might say stocks are the only game in town. Moreover, suppressing interest rates helps to “steer” investors into stocks – a technique known as financial repression. Financial repression was first used by smaller, emerging economies when its debt became elevated. When an abundance of money flows into stocks, it tends to push stock prices higher, which in turn makes investors *feel* wealthier. This is known as the “wealth effect.” Low interest rates also make it easier to repay debt.

I’m not exactly sure if I’m posting in the right section, but i thought i would try here first. 

I recently inherited 1,200 shares of Apple, 1,000 shares of Tesla, 500 shares of Facebook and other miscellaneous stocks. All stocks were purchased in 2014 if that makes a difference. When i talked to my Schwab broker 2 months ago, she wanted me to convert 50% into index funds. Since then, my portfolio has 2x. Every couple of weeks she calls and says  i should sell Tesla &amp; Apple and invest in very random companies. 

I’m very fortunate to have inherited this, but i would love to know what others would do?  I’m open to more risky investments but would love others input about next steps.

It has 133 outlets (over half owned) and it sold just under 155,000 cars in 2019, with an average selling price of £17,200. The company has grown by acquiring existing dealers using cash generated from operations and has a solid mix of dealerships relative to what car brands actually sell well in the UK. 

The auto dealership industry is one of the most basic industries in the world. The dealerships serve as the manufacturers’ parts and services distributor. The OEM’s decentralize this part of the ‘value chain’ to not only simplify their operations but to reduce the amount of capital invested in the business – which is already huge in the manufacturing of cars. There are around 2.5M new cars sold each year, around 8M used cars sold and a car parc of around 35M vehicles.

The auto dealership industry has been marked by one long-term trend: consolidation. According to Grant Thornton, in 1976 there were around 10,000 dealerships in the UK whereas today there are around 4,600, a decline of 1.7% p.a.. This is despite the fact that since 1976 the market for new cars has doubled in size (at peak year) – 1.28 million new cars sold in 1976 versus 2.6 million in 2018. So, on average, each dealer is doing more business than they were 10, 20 or 30 years ago. According to AM100, the top 100 largest dealerships accounted for 46% of totally industry revenue in 2009 versus 60% today. In terms of revenue, the 10 largest dealerships in the UK account for around £33 billion in revenue, or around 25% of the new and used car industry. In terms of vehicles sales – which are around 2.5M new cars and 8M used cars – the top 10 account for ~15%.

The scene is set in a thick forest where greenery is plentiful and animals are chilled. Animals are at peace all doing what they do best. 

The fox is bored with this lovely life. Decides to cook up a story to have some fun. 

Says that there's a feast on the other side of the forest and starts running ""towards it"" and as he meets more animals, convinces them that they need to join him in the sprint to the feast. Initially hesitant, they join in for the treat, first a few hungry ones and then, as the word gets around, more and more, even the healthy ones.

A large number of animals are now desperately running ""to get to the feast"" ... Which they believe to be true since ""someone told them about it"".

Having achieved what he set out to, the fox decides to chill, stop running and enjoy the panic. He loves his creation. Laughs at the foolish animals who are headed to the invisible feast. ""How clever"" he thought of himself as he sat in the comfort of his favourite tree, seeing the huge crowds run.

Days become weeks and months and an increasing numbers of animals are ""rushing to the feast"". Continues unabated. 

After a while, when this gets boring, the Fox tries to tell them that it's all a made up story and there is no such feast, and it's all make believe. But none of them will have it. They're only increasing their numbers and pace. Some think the fox is trying to talk them out of the feast for his own selfish gains or that he's too lazy to participate in the feast.

He can't seem to ignore that the crowds are increasing with days. Finally one day the fox thinks ""I know there isn't any real feast, but WHAT IF IT'S TRUE""?! 

The fox decides to join the run too.

This story has nothing to do with the bull run, since this was set before shares and options were invented.

Analysts will continue filling up research reports with guesses about  what a Joe Biden presidency or a Donald Trump re-election victory would  mean for the stock market. But nothing is likely to shake up financial  markets come Nov. 4 — the day after the election — quite like an unclear  outcome.

For anyone who’s been paying attention to the bitter 2020 presidential race, it’s a scenario that isn’t easy to dismiss. 

This year’s election already looks likely to be “the most  litigated in history,”  wrote Thomas McLoughlin, head of Americas fixed  income at UBS , in a Tuesday note. Plaintiffs have filed 192 lawsuits in  at least 41 states arising from changes to voting procedures in the  wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. Combined with other lawsuits  that predate the coronavirus outbreak, the total number of challenges  rises to more than 200.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Tuesday sought to reassure voters over  fears the U.S. Postal Service would be unable to handle a surge in  mail-in voting, announcing the agency would suspend operational changes,  including removing mailboxes and sorting machines, ahead of the  November election. 

Such moves, which DeJoy had implemented in what the agency had said  were efforts to cut costs, drew scrutiny from Democrats. They accused  the administration of seeking to slow the delivery of ballots in  response to President Trump’s opposition to universal mail-in voting.

Trump, who trails Biden in national polls, has charged that  mail-in voting carries the potential for widespread fraud, though  studies have found no such evidence.

A study by the conservative Heritage Foundation and reviewed by  the liberal Brookings Institution found  fewer than **50 instances of  voter fraud in a sample of the five states that use mailed ballots  exclusively**, McLoughlin noted.

But a delayed outcome, even  with few added postal service hangups, remains a significant  possibility given the potential crush of mail-in votes this year. After  all, it took six weeks to certify results for two congressional  primaries in New York this summer, while the outcome of Utah’s close  Republican gubernatorial primary was delayed for a few days as absentee  ballots were counted, the analyst noted.

Meanwhile, if the popular vote in battleground states is close,  it’s likely some states would be counting absentee ballots well into  the evening of Nov. 3 and the following day, McLoughlin said, noting  that a handful of battleground states, including North Carolina, Iowa,  and Ohio, only require that the ballot be postmarked by Election Day and  received shortly thereafter to be counted. 

**So what happens if the outcome is unclear?** Investors can look  back to the 2000 presidential election, which  wasn’t decided until  mid-December as lawyers and surrogates for Democrat Al Gore and  Republican George W. Bush engaged in a battle over Florida recounts that  saw terms like “butterfly ballot” and “hanging chads” enter everyday  conversation.

The S&amp;P 500  [SPX, +0.23%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) fell 8.4% between election day on Nov. 7 and Dec. 15, the day  after Gore conceded in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that ended the  recount (**see chart below**).

HOWEVER the warrants don’t expire until March 2024. That’s a long time for things to turn around. As it stands there is potentially a multi thousand dollar upside to an investment of $70, provided that you actually have the cash to exercise the warrants. 

To realize the same returns with shares would require a substantially larger upfront investment, making these warrants the superior option purely from a risk / reward standpoint.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/NM12WCc](https://imgur.com/NM12WCc)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Q12020 PBPB had approximately $40MM in cash flows form financing activities, primarily  borrowings under a credit facility.
2. Q22020 PBPB had a debit of approximately $16MM i cash flow from financing activities as a result from repayments to that credit facility

This brings net cash provided by cash flow activities for Q20202 to around \~22M.

I dont understand:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why the chart is -22M when the net cash is positive
2. ""17.14"" is the correct value of the change in cash flows from financing

FansUnite Entertainment (FANS) is a founder led disruptor in the online gambling industry. Active in the UK and Canada, FANS has been pursuing M&amp;A activities and is utilizing the benefits of blockchain technology. FANS is taking advantage of the current COVID crisis to cement itself as a major player in the e-sports betting market. A relatively new phenomenon that has seen tremendous growth in recent years and has untapped potential as it’s popularity continues to grow worldwide. 

Founder and CEO Darius Eghdami has surrounded himself with all-stars in the field, something I respect immensely and shows he has his ego in check and recognizes the value and importance of one’s entourage. FANS has added two industry veterans, Saxon Shadforth and Harish Narayanan Ramachandran, to its board of directors. 

Saxon Shadforth has “over 25 years of global leadership expertise and 15 years’ experience as an online gambling executive. With a background in commercialization, consumer hardware/software, enterprise software, product strategy and delivery; Saxon has extensive experience managing complex ecosystems required to operate and scale gaming brands in many categories and jurisdictions.” He provides the experience the company needs to continue expanding into various international gaming markets. 

Harish Narayanan Ramachandran is the former president of PaddyPower Betfair, one of the world's largest gaming companies. As an experienced gaming executive, he brings a wealth of experience and will be an integral part of FANS aggressive international mergers and acquisitions growth strategy.

FANS has acquired McBookie Ltd. a leading provider of regulated betting services in the United Kingdom. Total consideration for the acquisition of McBookie was $2.2M CAD. McBookie had no long term debt at the time of the acquisition. The recent acquisition of McBookie provides a strong foundation for the future of FansUnite as the Company continues to look to consolidate assets in leading regulated gaming jurisdictions such as the U.K.

FANS also acquired Askott, a Vancouver based software development company with a team that has been building award-winning online gambling software since 2013. Askott has produced a one of a kind complete iGaming platform, Chameleon Gaming Platform, with an esports first focus geared for the next generation of online bettors and casino players. The B2B Chameleon Platform will now offer partners additional revenue streams through The Ear's Casino Aggregator hub by giving them access to over 6,000 casino games through a single integration. This will enhance Askott partners' offering and more importantly provide bettors with more entertainment options to choose from.

“The amalgamation with Askott is a significant milestone and transforms us into one of Canada's premier iGaming companies. Combining with Askott provides us with a fully integrated gaming asset that offers multiple B2C platforms for users in a variety of betting offerings, B2B technology that can be licensed to all types of sportsbooks, and a seasoned team of executives that have led and grown multiple organizations on a global scale. This combination creates a leading online iGaming company, and positions us strongly for significant growth with new offerings and market opportunities."" - Darius Eghdami

Sports betting is widely regarded as a vertical that will be disrupted by blockchain technology, with its inherent properties of transparency, security and immutably stored data providing a compelling use-case for both bettors and operators. Ethereum has established itself as the preeminent public blockchain in terms of developer mindshare, number of unique addresses, and transactions processed — surpassing 52% of all cryptocurrency transactions last year. The FansUnite Protocol provides the first viable solution for sports betting applications to accept transactions in any token on the Ethereum blockchain. 

FansUnite’s key assets are:

FansUnite Protocol: Free and shared infrastructure decentralized applications (“DApps”) will be able to build atop of and leverage FansUnite’s Oracle network for bet resolution while still accepting wagers in any Ethereum-based token. The FansUnite Protocol will consist of a public library of smart contracts, standardized data structures, and a token economy designed to incentivize the provisioning of fast and accurate sports data by a decentralized network of oracles. The investor-backed blockchain solution eliminates pain-points that plague the existing wagering market, allowing for near-zero margins, together with trustless and equitable ecosystem.

FansUnite Sportsbook: The FansUnite core team will develop the first DApp, the FansUnite Sportsbook, to leverage the FansUnite Protocol. The FansUnite Sportsbook will feature a 1% margin and social elements designed to allow collaboration amongst bettors. The social sportsbook concept described below highlights just one possible implementation of a DApp on this protocol. We anticipate a whole ecosystem of DApps leveraging the FansUnite Protocol and Oracle network, limited only by the ingenuity of developers and Community Members.

FansUnite Media Inc.: FansUnite Media Inc., a subsidiary of FansUnite Entertainment Inc., is the interest owner of FansUnite.com. FansUnite.com is a social sports betting community started by three sports fans who wanted to take sports back to the people that fuel the industry, the fans! With FansUnite’s free virtual currency, users are able to place fantasy wagers with absolutely zero monetary risk, track their bets with FansUnite’s proprietary PickTracker and get a full-unedited look into their own history.

The online sports betting market in the US has drastically changed after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2018, as any state got the option to pursue legalization. In total, sports betting became legal in some form in 24 states. There is still huge untapped potential in states like California, where sports betting in not officially legal yet. Nevertheless, despite the legal challenges, interest in the industry is high. If FANS can cement itself in the US market, it’s growth prospects become even more enticing.

# Did Putin’s daughter die after taking the COVID-19 vaccine?

In August 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his country had approved a vaccine against COVID-19 and that the country would begin administering it to the public in the coming weeks. While Putin claimed the vaccine was safe – even noting that his daughter had taken it – the news of the vaccine raised concern among some in the scientific community who believed Russia may have taken it. shortcuts to speed up production of this vaccine.

In the days following the announcement, social media was inundated with views and fake news. A video supposedly showing Putin’s daughter being vaccinated, for example, actually showed a volunteer with no connection to the Russian president:

On August 15, another unverified allegation about Putin’s daughter began circulating on social media. The TorontoToday.net website published an article claiming that Putin’s daughter died after taking her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine:

&gt;*VLADIMIR PUTIN’S DAUGHTER DIES AFTER SECOND DOSE OF COVID VACCINE*  
*VLADIMIR PUTIN’S DAUGHTER SUFFERED UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL RUSSIAN COVID VACCINE AND DIED IN MOSCOW. THE KREMLIN HAS YET TO MAKE A STATEMENT ON HIS DEATH. A SOURCE IN RUSSIA’S INNER CIRCLE SAID PUTIN’S DAUGHTER – KATERINA TIKHONOVA – SUFFERED A RISE IN TEMPERATURE SHORTLY AFTER HER SECOND INJECTION AND THEN SUFFERED A SEIZURE. DOCTORS WERE UNABLE TO REVERSE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINE AND SHE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD LATE LAST NIGHT.*

No idea which daughter... [https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/upload/wire/2014/07/24/Screen\_Shot\_2014\_07\_24\_at\_12.48.09\_PM/lead\_large.png](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/upload/wire/2014/07/24/Screen_Shot_2014_07_24_at_12.48.09_PM/lead_large.png)

 iberdrola IBDRY (51$ per share) 

Largest clean  energy company in spain, good growth, is buying up smaller firms, analysts from various investing websites recommend.

 raytheon RTX  (62$ per share)

Boeing is continuing to have alot of problems with the quality of its airplanes, with all the crashes happening as well, raytheon is cheaper and seems to be a good alternative long term. 

HISA (a REIT)

It seems that this is a bit more risky,  but could pay off in the long run. 


Maybe Walmart (WMT)?

I was thinking of trying more green energy, but I dont want to put my eggs in one basket.

The S&amp;P 500 is still very close to record highs although hasn't actually been able to cross the line just yet. Could be today, the market is not showing signs of slowing down.

**AAPL** and **TSLA** have both announced a stock split in recent weeks. This doesn't actually change anything but the market has reacted very bullishly.

Buffet's big bet on **GOLD** helped pushed the price of gold higher and Bitcoin climbed to new 52-week highs. 

There are some China tensions that don't appear to be having much impact on the markets. The **VIX** is dropping, futures are up and everything appears bullish on a slow Tuesday.

**Watchlist:**

**CLPS** is a low float, resistance at $4.71

**FORD** is a low float, watching for a setup above $2.71

**KIRK** is a low float, on watch

**QUMU** is a low float, support at $5.50

**REDU** is a low float, support at $6

**LXU** is a lowish float, watching for a setup above $3.21

**ICLK** key level is $8.50

**PEIX** watching for a setup above $4.60

**LAC** key level at $9

**CBAY** resistance at $7

**TRIL** has resistance at $9.66

**MIK** has resistance at $9

**FINV** has resistance at $2.50

Other comments:

Fostamatinib is already FDA and EMA approved and can currently be prescribed if desired for Covid-19.

CEO confirmed that the research performed by the Harvard + MIT researchers doesn't just apply to Covid-19 pneumonia/ARDS but potentially many other forms as well.

Exclusive rights to fostamatinib held until 2032.

This is not a vaccine, but a SYK inhibitor that blocks the inflammatory process in a highly potent and selective way.

Additionally, fostamatinib has an established safety profile with only 1% of patients experiencing an adverse event which is usually in the form of elevated blood pressure or diarrhea.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,500809,public,confidence,self,$RIGL - Rigel Pharmaceuticals [Harvard and MIT researchers want this FDA approved drug to be rapidly re-purposed to treat Covid-19],0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ibp2k7/rigl_rigel_pharmaceuticals_harvard_and_mit/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'aHVfbKiEFP6jvC-dFr2r7Ekzw2QVxCMcThSCijgL9KY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 58, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0PzN-y5RWyRa9H_x-5-FAplWcXoQyyGaoMXVRQDOdZE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e962f504fcc417323a1275f5979096288d49f437', 'width': 108}, {'height': 116, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0PzN-y5RWyRa9H_x-5-FAplWcXoQyyGaoMXVRQDOdZE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8b02b21c30afcaa37e36cd1b1745f46815c6491', 'width': 216}, {'height': 173, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0PzN-y5RWyRa9H_x-5-FAplWcXoQyyGaoMXVRQDOdZE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f5db0f0077a3cc0436c43714a8fc3f02dd2519c', 'width': 320}, {'height': 346, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0PzN-y5RWyRa9H_x-5-FAplWcXoQyyGaoMXVRQDOdZE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62629287bf37ec21181601a1f9dec7e68be78e6d', 'width': 640}, {'height': 519, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0PzN-y5RWyRa9H_x-5-FAplWcXoQyyGaoMXVRQDOdZE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4618b6cf9105cd444e3dd0a391af3c162c8da843', 'width': 960}, {'height': 584, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0PzN-y5RWyRa9H_x-5-FAplWcXoQyyGaoMXVRQDOdZE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196a8b522909aa51235c460087e85d0bab99fa76', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 621, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0PzN-y5RWyRa9H_x-5-FAplWcXoQyyGaoMXVRQDOdZE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a00fc420cc8930223fb898d51ce3147a1bc0f8dd', 'width': 1147}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

He shared many great insights about studying Volume/Price action and finding ideal entry setups. We go through a ton of his recent trades discussing where he bought/sold and why including CELH PRTS ZM FUTU APPS. It was very interesting hearing him talk about his process of building positions and taking profits.

Here is the link to the interview. It's a hour long but I've included timestamps in the comment section so you can skip around to what would be most helpful for you.

———————————————————————

Opening disclosure - I'm long around 100 shares on this stock. 

Despite some of the feelings that BOXL is a meme/pumpndump stock, they are a legit company with an actual history of operating and sales. I kind of wish I didn't spend the money on them, but after today's call those feelings are at least much more optimistic.

**Key Financial Highlights for Q2 2020**

* Revenues decreased by 28% to $7.8 million
* Customer orders decreased by 55% to $6.4 million
* Gross profit increased by 670 basis points to 34%
* Operating expenses decreased by 17% to $3.5 million
* Operating loss decreased by 36% to $0.8 million
* Net loss was even at $1.4 million
* EPS loss decreased by 40% to $(0.08)
* Adjusted EBITDA loss decreased by 69% to $0.3 million
* Adjusted EPS decreased by 81% to loss of $0.01
* Ended quarter with $2.5 million in backlog orders
* Working capital improved by 175% to $3.8 million
* Stockholders’ equity improved by 1,757% to $10.7 million

**Key Takeaways from Call**

*  Acquired Robo3D and MyStemKits (3d Printing for Education)
* Demand and sales down due to COVID, but so are some operating expenses
* Recent share dilutions addressed
   * Helped the company end the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet for ""future acquisition and joint venture opportunities""
   * Will help the company address previous capital issues including finishing the $2.5M order backlog and other potential sales turned away due to lack of available inventory
* Gross margin is expected to hold 30%+ over the next few quarters
   * Mostly comes from professional services provided, approximately 70%
   * Also comes from high margin hardware sales
* Schools are in/planning to move to hybrid learning models, mainly for younger children where in-person instruction is more valuable. High schools are looking towards virtual learning.
* 2Q 2020 expected to be bottom of demand, and back on pace by 1Q 2021
* Samsung Partnership
   * Basically a software/hardware partnership where Boxlight provides the ed. software and Samsung will obviously provide the screens and perhaps other peripherals, I assume at some type of wholesale cost to the company.
   * The company expects to realize sales from the sale of the hardware itself, the software, and training/other professional services related to their sales.
   * The company expects a big bump in business from the PR, and are already getting inquiries from schools/districts in regards to the partnership
* There are some deals potentially in the works on an international level in the UK and in Mexico.

## U.S.-China Tensions Brewing Again

The six-month trade review between the U.S and China was slated for the weekend, but that didn’t happen. It is not clear why the trade review did not happen. But the recent technology ban might be one of the many reasons. Amongst the notable names that caught in the crosshairs between the two largest economies are WeChat, TikTok, and Huawei. More Chinese companies are added to the economic blacklists as instructed by the Trump administration. As such, the increasing tensions could become bigger headwinds for stock markets in the coming days. The main concern is that if either the U.S. and/or China resort to a “cold war”, that wouldn’t do good to both economies. And it probably won’t do good for the rest of the world as well.

One of the main highlights in recent weeks, Trump issued an executive order which requires ByteDance to sell or spin off its U.S. TikTok business in 90 days. Trump cited “credible evidence” that ByteDance “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” 

News of Taiwan agreeing to purchase dozens of F-16 jets from American company Lockheed Martin has also contributed to the rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. This appears to be the first time such deals have taken place since 1992. Thus, there is no surprise if Beijing is not too pleased about it.

And this is only 18 days after the nation marked 150,000 lives lost. This shows that more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths have been reported nearly every day this month. This is with the exception of five days where the number was under the threshold. 

Investors typically rush to gold as they grow more worried about a [stock market](http://www.stockmarket.com/) rout. An uptick in coronavirus cases or deaths throughout the U.S. sparked new fears of a longer than expected recession. Weak sentiments, volatile stocks, and other asset prices could also prompt investors to buy gold or assets with strong gold exposure for hedging. Warren Buffett’s acquisition of a certain stake in Barrick Gold may have surprised some. But it has certainly led investors to look for top gold stocks to buy this week.

The S&amp;P 500 failed to break through to new records on Friday. Markets closed mixed close to flat. Overall the underlying conditions have not changed, the money printer is still running strong and bears are nowhere to be found. I'll be watching for new records this week.

The NY Times has an article out, with no science to back it, stating that herd immunity for COVID-19 may come sooner than expected. This bullish sentiment may be just the catalyst we need to get to new levels.

I'm bullish this week and will be increasing risk. Last week was my first green week after 5 red weeks in a row.

**Watchlist:**

**KIRK** is a low float, support at $7.50

**HYRE** is a low float, watching for a setup above $4.08

**HDSN** has resistance at $1.45

**AQST** watching for a setup above $7.34

**GRWG** watching for a setup above $13.28

**EMAN** has resistance at $1.90

**ZSAN** has resistance in the $1.75-1.80 range

So thank you, everyone, who has participated in comment discussion, and posted useful and appreciated content for our fellow investor members. We have also grown our [live chat](https://discord.com/invite/eYd3G5f) massively, expanded the massive amount of [tools and resources available](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit), as well as continued with all the content production that is always running!

I personally have been stuck this year in projects that have severely limited my ability to produce content for this place like I once was, but not only am I about to change that, the team that makes this place run is as awesome as they have ever been! K**eep your ears peaked and your sites refreshed ;)**

# Some shout-outs as they are tradition :) &lt;3

[/u/stockjock-e](https://www.reddit.com/u/stockjock-e/), our main man who forged this subreddit now over 12 years ago who to this day fights to make this place as great as it is. Without our own Stockjock-e, there is no subreddit here for you.

[/u/bigbear0083](https://www.reddit.com/u/bigbear0083/), our local heavy-hitter. It is absurd how hard our resident bear hits when it comes to upgrades, and still to this day blows my mind how he built and worked out everything he has provided. If there is something great on this sub from the moderator team, there is about a 90% chance this man planned, built, and launched it.

[/u/ghostofgbt](https://www.reddit.com/u/ghostofgbt/), who still calls himself ""a new moderator"" but pulls the weight of 10 men have done so for years and years. This man has found an amazing place here and has become an essential person to make this place what it is.

[/u/wittlyfun](https://www.reddit.com/u/wittlyfun/) for the financial tools that have been built that our users can make use of. Hard to beat straight-on useful content.

**There is of course tons of people who build this place, both on the moderator team but even more on the active contributors from the subscribers. So I want to personally thank all of you for whatever you provide.** I spend way too much time reading, scanning, moderating, and learning from this subreddit, and if you post something here it is very likely I have read it. If you shit-posted, it is also very likely I was the one who removed your post. **With all of that said, thanks to everyone who makes this place what it is.

The 15th of March was our best day in history, growing us [2500+ subscribers in a single day](https://imgur.com/a/WyH6jpc), center in the[COVID-19 market drop](https://imgur.com/a/G0yPRaf). You'd think we would grow more in times of mania? But perhaps discussion comes from panic?

So thank you, everyone, who has participated in comment discussion, and posted useful and appreciated content for our fellow investor members. We have also grown our [live chat](https://discord.com/invite/eYd3G5f) massively, expanded the massive amount of [tools and resources available](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit), as well as continued with all the content production that is always running!

I personally have been stuck this year in projects that have severely limited my ability to produce content for this place like I once was, but not only am I about to change that, the team that makes this place run is as awesome as they have ever been! K**eep your ears peaked and your sites refreshed ;)**

# Some shout-outs as they are tradition :)  &lt;3

[/u/stockjock-e](https://www.reddit.com/u/stockjock-e/), our main man who forged this subreddit now over 12 years ago who to this day fights to make this place as great as it is. Without our own Stockjock-e, there is no subreddit here for you.

[/u/bigbear0083](https://www.reddit.com/u/bigbear0083/), our local heavy-hitter. It is absurd how hard our resident bear hits when it comes to upgrades, and still to this day blows my mind how he built and worked out everything he has provided. If there is something great on this sub from the moderator team, there is about a 90% chance this man planned, built, and launched it.

/u/ghostofgbt, who still calls himself ""a new moderator"" but pulls the weight of 10 men have done so for years and years. This man has found an amazing place here and has become an essential person to make this place what it is.

[/u/wittlyfun](https://www.reddit.com/u/wittlyfun/) for the financial tools that have been built that our users can make use of. Hard to beat straight-on useful content.

**There is of course tons of people who build this place, both on the moderator team but even more on the active contributors from the subscribers. So I want to personally thank all of you for whatever you provide.** I spend way too much time reading, scanning, moderating, and learning from this subreddit, and if you post something here it is very likely I have read it. If you shit-posted, it is also very likely I was the one who removed your post. **With all of that said, thanks to everyone who makes this place what it is. See you at 600k and afterward in the** [**dos commas club!**](https://imgur.com/a/9a4ysGb)

Trading volumes of U.S. stocks on Futu Holdings Ltd.’s app, China’s largest online trading platform for overseas equities, more than tripled in the first three months of the year after staying more or less constant in 2019, according to Citigroup Inc. estimates. It jumped again in the second quarter to $55.4 billion.

Fewer restrictions — such as the ability to short sell (bet that a stock will fall) and looser limits on price fluctuations— have made equities traded in New York attractive even as the domestic Chinese market runs red hot. The Shanghai benchmark equity index is up about 10% this year versus the S&amp;P 500’s 4%. The growing interest is despite China’s capital controls, which mean individuals are only allowed to take $50,000 outside the country each year. Futu doesn’t convert Renminbi for clients, meaning they already need to have foreign currency funds.

The initial price of ATS stock will open at $1 and has the potential to increase as wallet signups increase. Revenue will be earned through ATS’s exchange and master node integrations. As more user’s signup to the wallet, ATS will be able to generate appropriate revenue to attribute to shareholders. To get a better understanding of the stock, lets look at some important aspects of ATS wallet.

Before we jump into the article, lets first go over what an IPO is.

# IPO

According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) an IPO is “An initial public offering (IPO) refers to the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance. Public share issuance allows a company to raise capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes share premiums for current private investors. Meanwhile, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering.”

# Storage

The ATS wallet will allow users to store cryptocurrency and help facilitate transactions with easy user interphases. This will help attract users to the wallet and will help the wallet gain popularity across the competitive market.

# Security

Security is important for any cryptocurrency wallet to prioritize. ATS will allow users to create pins and safely store their cryptocurrency with FDIC insurance.

# Exchange

ATS will also have an open exchange that will allow users to conveniently trade their cryptocurrency. This exchange will feature privacy and allow users to transact without having their identity compromised. This will be an advanced feature of the wallet and transparent data from the exchange will be made public so the community can stick with the project.

# Masternode

As cryptocurrency shifts into more proof of stake consensus, ATS will help facilitate these. Currently, wallet users can stake their DASH cryptocurrency easily in just a few steps. This integration will help bring users to the wallet and will generate revenue to help boost ATS’s stock price.

# Mobile friendly

Today, cryptocurrency is used all over the world in a variety of different mediums, so it’s important that wallets capitalize on this functionality and bring support to mobile. You’ll be able to access ATS wallet on your phone or desktop for transparent and timely use.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,499698,public,confidence,self,ATS Wallet IPO,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/iaq0al/ats_wallet_ipo/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Haven't ever posted here, but wanted to get some opinions on this DEF 14C document from CLSK dated July 28th 2020. I posted this over at [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) but it seems people would rather talk about IDEX over there so it didn't get much attention. Anyway, here's the document:

[https://www.proxydocs.com/0/001/512/177/information\_statement.pdf](https://www.proxydocs.com/0/001/512/177/information_statement.pdf)

Is this something to be weary of as a shareholder?

This document is addressing an approval for an increase in the common stock from 20M to up to 50M. Logically I know that this is a form of dilution, but I'm not sure what else to call it. Would these ahres come out in the form of a public offering? I'm still learning, so be gentle. It says that they are effectively giving stockholders 20 days advanced notice before they may put it into effect, although they have an entire year to do it. The document is dated July 28th so that would put the earliest effective date right at 8/17 which is Monday.

Also 20M seems like a fairly low number of o/s shares. Am I wrong in that assessment?

Just curious as to people's thoughts on this and what it means for shareholders. Someone on [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) gave some hearsay input that an email response was received from CLSK claiming that they do not plan on putting out an offering unless there is some sort of acquisition. Perhaps this is just to leave that possibility on the table and they don't plan on dropping an offering otherwise. I know they just did an offering around July 20th and it didn't seem to affect the stock price at all, but that was a smaller amount in the single digit millions.

Any input is appreciated. Thanks.

I decided to whip up some quick charts on the scheduled departing seats for the Top 10 US airports across last year and through September of this year. Keep in mind that these are \*scheduled\* seats and do not account for cancellations or load factors. Speaking of load factor, 2019 would probably be close to 70% full on average, whereas now you automatically cap out at 67% due to the middle seat policy, but is realistically closer to 30%. Not only are the available seats much lower, but so are the loads meaning that the flights are down probably 70% total in terms of carried passengers. Make of it what you will, I'm just sharing data.

It was a mistake for the ages -- a “clerical error,” as Citigroup told lenders -- that’s now plunged the bank into a battle between the Perelman empire and a corps of sharp-edged investment funds that have become its impatient creditors.

I'm a rising college senior in Southern Cali who started trading/investing at the end of March. Its been a wild ride to say the least. During the height of the bull rally, I had a return of 62% (I know, it's not the best) and now I'm down to a return of 23%. 

After reading some investing books and listening to well-known finance investors on podcasts, I've sold everything in my portfolio except a few shares of AAPL and NVDA. Over the next couple weeks, I'll slowly be moving my money into Index ETFs. 

The main reason I made this decision was because of the tons of snapchat and IG stories of my friends/classmates in college without masks, no social distancing, and partying on the beaches. Colleges, like mine, made last minute decisions to go fully virtual this semester, so many students signed apartment leases already. Now, my school won't require weekly covid testing and have created environments where students will live in close proximity of each other off campus when they take their classes virtually. I only imagine elementary and high schools will be just as bad since the kids will inevitably bring the virus back to their families. 

With fall around the corner and no stimulus bill in sight, I can see a decent market pullback coming soon. I hope I'm wrong, but the US is definitely playing with fire by reopening schools.

Last week, Moderna (MRNA) had news that they were selling 100m COVID Vaccines to the US Gov. and I knew that would cause a large demand, so I wanted to get in. Maybe an hour after the news came out (which seems to still be far too long to wait in these markets) I placed an order to buy about 2% over the closing price. When I woke up for market open, I noticed my order didn't get filled and I made the mistake to quickly replace it with an order at a higher price.  


This ended up being a terrible rookie mistake because I panicked, bought too high, and just an hour or so into the market being open the price had settled back down and I was down a couple hundred bucks. It was a good learning opportunity for me, but something I still didn't 100% understand is how exactly do after-hours orders end up getting executed?  In this situation what is the best strategy for opening a long position like this? I had a limit order at first but my trade wasn't filled and I'm not sure why. Was it likely that there were so many other buyers at my price or above it that got in before me that got their orders executed first? If multiple orders are at the same buy price, do they execute in FIFO order (like a queue)?  


If you were trying to open a position like this what would have you done? Do you avoid after-hours trading altogether? If so, I feel like I would lose out on a lot of big gains due to news releases like this. Market orders also seem risky cause I just never know why price I would end up getting in at and it could have been worst than what I did.  Are there any indicators that you can look at to know what kind of order and at what price point is best?

40 year old Robinhood thug here. I'm not a finance guy, never have been.   
But I've spend the past few weeks learning what I can about the market-was going to jump in around march, but being that I'm an idiot, I waned to have an endgame and see some rebound first.   
With the Rona , these are crazy times. But in my lifetime there has never been a crash with a definite means to an end.  We're seeing the frontronners in the vaccine game will be in front of the FDA by November, at least two pharma companies  have contracts, and are currently producing 100 mil doses each of their vaccine to be ready when the FDA approves the vaccines, which after phase 2 are showing nothing but promise.   
I think it'll be closer to Dec, but to be safe let's call it Feb that we've all got access to the vaccine. That's the magic pill..it's the end all be all, and this whole thing is gone. I'm not saying all companies who have suffered are magically back to their feb numbers from the year prior, but airlines, restaurants, and hotels should be slammed. What's the first thing everyone's gonna do the moment you're immune to the virus after being stuck in your home for the past 6 months? We're all getting on airplanes to visit family or take a vacation.   
Currently airlines like United, for example, are still so far down. United is trading at 35, when they would normally be at least in the 80s. Let's say you just play them to 70. That's a 100 percent profit. And are we seriously thinking it'll take a year before they hit that mark? I think they hit 70 by Feb.   
Also, Dave and Busters. Trading at 15, normally in the 40s in Feb. With kids out of school, and again, as soon as the vaccine comes out, why are we to think they won't be flooded in the middle of winter as people can get out of the house again?   
I've got plenty of others I watch, Target Hospitalities, Ruth, Marriott, etc. But so far from what I'm looking at United, being the #1 airline in the US (and stimulus money coming), has lost the most, therefore has the most to gain. American actually has a bit more to gain in terms of percentage, but I'm playing it safe thinking that if any airline isn't going bankrupt (and none of them are), it's united.   


So here's my question:  
Shouldn't we all just be throwing everything we have into these stocks? We're not buying these companies. We're buying the idea that there is a means to an end, and life will get back to normal. Tesla and apple have splits coming, and that's all great (maybe), but isn't there more money to be made in the next 6 months playing the value game while finding the companies who stand the most to gain for the rebound?  And shouldn't we be all-in before the next stimulus to take effect?  What am I missing here?  
Thank you for your insight. And anyone who is also playing this game, I'd be grateful for any additional companies...I'm trying to find who's the sure thing tos make 200% profit in 6 months. So far,  I think Dave and Buster's is the winner.

This is not meant as a flex or anything but I just wanted to share the long term sustainable results that you can achieve by investing the right way. 

Many posts out there would go on to talk about investing in the next hot stock or bitcoin or options but none of those are ever sustainable in the long run. You could easily lose your life savings following those or even if you do make money, it is never sustainable. 

Successful long term investing is as what Warren Buffett always preaches, thoroughly understanding a business, and investing in great businesses at great prices.

Those are the principles that I live by as well and they've served me well. 

Here are some tips I have that I hope would benefit you:

\- Focus on the long term

\- Only investing in what you understand

\- Successful investing is not just all brains, but also requires the right temperament

\- Never invest based on others' opinion

Hope these tips are helpful and you can connect with me down below too:

Are you dollar cost averaging right now at all time high prices?

Holding onto cash and waiting ?

I think that before the stock split, a rise to $1700 is possible, without serious drawdowns. Don't forget about S&amp;P inclusion speculation.

Then, without a serious driver,  I expect stagnation or even a drawdown to more adequate levels.Now TSLA is too overbought, I think. The higher they rise, the more difficult it's to hold onto even with new positive news

Got into the market with all the supposed ‘millennials’ in early April. I am nota millennial, just ignorant and late to the game. I missed out on what looks like the bottoming out in March, but as of today, I’m up 12%. Is that good?

Right now all I have are individual stocks. I’m looking to grow my investment by putting all my extra money into the market. I don’t need the money any time soon, so I’d like to invest in something for a few years. Should I get in on EFTs in this case or just the individual stocks? 

My winners thus far are BRK.B CVAC REGI TSLA and BTC. Seems too good to be true that investing can be this easy. Why wouldn’t I just stick with these socks and watch my money grow exponentially?

I am just looking for advice. Maybe you could suggest a past post that is like investing 101 for dummies? I have ordered ‘The Intelligent Investor’ to read, but I’m afraid the info may be lost on me since it was written so long ago.

# **Stocks are ignoring the lack of a stimulus package from Congress, but that could change  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/stocks-are-ignoring-the-lack-of-a-stimulus-package-from-congress-but-that-could-change.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could hang at record levels but gains may be capped until Congress agrees to a new stimulus package to help the economy and the millions of unemployed Americans.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&amp;P 500 flirted with record levels it set in February.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, there are some major retailers reporting earnings, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, but the season is mostly over and the market is entering a quiet period. There are minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, released Wednesday, and housing data, including starts Tuesday and existing sales Friday.
*****
&gt; Investors had been watching efforts by Congress to agree to a new stimulus package, but talks have failed and the Senate has gone on recess. There is a concern that Congress will not be convinced to provide a big enough package when it does get to work again on the next stimulus round because recent economic reports look stronger. July’s retail sales, for example, climbed to a record level and recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
*****
&gt; “The juxtaposition of getting more fiscal stimulus and better data has paralyzed us in our tracks … we’ve seen this sideways [market] action,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. “It feels like we need more action from Congress, and the concern is the longer we wait, the better the data gets and the less impactful the next round of stimulus will be.”
*****
&gt; Some technical analysts say the market may pull back around the high, to allow it to consolidate gains before moving higher into the end of the year. The S&amp;P 500 reached an all-time high of 3,393 on Feb. 19.
*****
&gt; Hogan said he expects stocks to tread sideways during the dog days of August, but they could begin to react negatively to the election in September. He also said it is important that progress continue against the spread of Covid-19, as the economy continues to reopen.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the market could have a wakeup call at some point that the stimulus package has not been approved.
*****
&gt; “I think it will cross over a line where they care,” he said. “I think the market is in suspended animation of believing there will be a magical deal.” Boockvar said he expects a deal ultimately, but the impact is not likely to be as big as the last round of funding.
*****
&gt; “What they’re not grasping is any deal, any extension of unemployment benefits, is going to be smaller than it was, and the rate of change should be the most important thing investors focus on,” he said. “Not the binary outcome of whether there’s a deal or no deal. There’s going to be less air going into the balloon.”
*****
&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; Still, economists expect to see a strong rebound in the third quarter, and are anticipating about about a 20% jump in third-quarter growth. But they also say that could be threatened if Congress does not help with another stimulus package.
*****
&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, described the July retail sales as a perfect V-shaped recovery, but cautioned it would not last unless more aid gets to individuals and cities and states. Democrats have sought a $3 trillion spending package, and Republicans in the Senate offered a $1 trillion package. They could not reach a compromise, including on a $600 weekly payment to individuals on unemployment which expired July 31.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump has tried to fill the gap with executive orders to provide extra benefits to those on unemployment, but the $300 federal payment and $100 from states may take some time to reach individuals, as the processing varies by state. He has also issued an order instructing the Treasury to temporarily defer collection of payroll taxes from individuals making up to $104,000.
*****
&gt; “I think in August and September, there will be a lot of Ws, if there’s not more help here,” said Zandi, referring to an economic recovery that retrenches from a V shape before heading higher again. “It’s clearly perplexing. It may take the stock market to say we’re not going to get what we expect, and sell off and light a fire.”
*****
&gt; Zandi said it could come to a situation like 2008, where the stock market sold off sharply before Congress would agree to a program that helped financial companies.
*****
&gt; “We need a TARP moment to get these guys to help. Maybe if the claims tick higher and the August employment numbers are soft, given the president is focused on the stock market, that might be what it takes to get them back to the table in earnest,” he said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that helped rescue banks during the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; He ultimately expects a package of about $1.5 trillion to be approved in September.
*****
&gt; The lack of funding for state and local governments could result in more layoffs, as they struggle with their current 2021 budgets, Zandi said. Already 1.3 million public sector jobs have been lost since February, and there will be more layoffs and more programs and projects cancelled. The impact will hit contractors and other businesses that provide services to local governments.
*****
&gt; “The multipliers on state and local government are among the highest of any form of support, so if you don’t provide it, it’s going to ripple through the economy pretty fast,” he said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect to see a softening in consumer spending in August with the more than 28 million Americans on unemployment benefits as of mid-July no longer receiving any supplemental pay.
*****
&gt; “The real irony is things are shaping up that September is going to be a bad month, and that’s going to show up in all the data in October,” Zandi said. “They are really taking a chance on this election by not acting.”

&gt; # 4 Charts That Will Amaze You

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index is a few points away from a new all-time high, completing one of the fastest recoveries from a bear market ever. But this will also seal the deal on the shortest bear market ever. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 Index lost 20% from an all-time high in only 16 trading days back in February and March, so it makes sense that this recovery could be one of the fastest ever.

&gt; From the lows on March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has now added more than 50%. Many have been calling this a bear market rally for months, while we have been in the camp this is something more. It’s easy to see why this rally is different based on where it stands versus other bear market rallies:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; They say the stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming. We absolutely saw that back in March and now with stocks near new highs, many have missed this record run. Here we show how stocks have been usually higher a year or two after corrections.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; After a historic drop in March, the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher in April, May, June, and July. This rare event has happened only 11 other times, with stocks gaining the final five months of the year a very impressive 10 times. Only 2018 and the nearly 20% collapse in December saw a loss those final five months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GS-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this bear market will go down as the fastest ever, at just over one month. The recovery back to new highs will be five months if we get there by August 23, making this one of the fastest recoveries ever. Not surprisingly, it usually takes longer for bear markets in a recession to recover; only adding to the impressiveness of this rally.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “It normally takes 30 months for bear markets during a recession to recover their losses, which makes this recovery all the more amazing,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strateigst Ryan Detrick.. “Then again, there has been nothing normal about this recession, so maybe we shouldn’t be shocked about yet another record going down in 2020.”

&gt; # When a Few Basis Points Packs a Punch

&gt; US Treasury yields have been on the rise this week with the 10-year yield rising 13 basis points (bps) from 0.56% up to 0.69% after getting as high as 0.72% on Thursday. A 13 bps move higher in interest rates may not seem like a whole lot, but with rates already at such low levels, a small move can have a pretty big impact on the prices of longer-term maturities.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-10-Year-Yield.png))**

&gt; Starting with longer-term US Treasuries, TLT, which measures the performance of maturities greater than 20 years, has declined 3.5% this week. Now, for a growth stock, 3.5% is par for the course, but that kind of move in the Treasury market is no small thing. The latest pullback for TLT also coincides with another failed attempt by the ETF to trade and stay above $170 for more than a day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-TLT.png))**

&gt; The further out the maturity window you go in the fixed income market, the bigger the impact of the move higher in interest rates. The Republic of Austria issued a 100-year bond in 2017, and its movements exemplify the wild moves that small changes in interest rates (from a low base) can have on prices. Just this week, the Austrian 100-year was down over 5%, which is a painful move no matter what type of asset class you are talking about. This week's move, though, was nothing compared to the stomach-churning swings from earlier this year. When Covid was first hitting the fan, the 100-year rallied 57% in the span of less than two months. That kind of move usually occurs over years rather than days, but in less than a third of that time, all those gains disintegrated in a two-and-a-half week span from early to late March. Easy come, easy go. Ironically enough, despite all the big up and down moves in this bond over the last year, as we type this, the bond's price is the same now as it was on this same day last year.

&gt; # Retail Sales Rock to New Highs

&gt; At the headline level, July’s Retail Sales report disappointed as the reading missed expectations by nearly a full percentage point. Just as soon as the report was released, we saw a number of stories pounce on the disappointment as a sign that the economy was losing steam. Looked at in more detail, though, the July report wasn’t all that bad. While the headline reading rose less than expected (1.2% vs 2.1%), Ex Autos and Ex Autos and Gas, the results were much better than expected. Not only that, but June’s original readings were all revised higher by around a full percentage point.

&gt; Besides the fact that this month’s report was better underneath the surface and June’s reading was revised higher, it was also notable as the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of sales in July hit a new record high. After the last record high back in January, only five months passed until American consumers were back to their pre-Covid spending ways. For the sake of comparison, back during the Financial Crisis, 40 months passed between the original high in Retail Sales in November 2007 and the next record high in April 2011. 5 months versus 40? Never underestimate the power of the US consumer!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-retail-sales-chart1.png))**

&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just released B.I.G. Tips report we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

&gt; # 100 Days of Gains

&gt; Today marked 100 trading days since the Nasdaq 100's March 20th COVID Crash closing low. Below is a chart showing the rolling 100-trading day percentage change of the Nasdaq 100 since 1985. The 59.8% gain over the last 100 trading days ranks as the 3rd strongest run on record. The only two stronger 100-day rallies ended in January 1999 and March 2000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/ndx100use.png))**

&gt; While the Nasdaq 100 bottomed on Friday, March 20th, the S&amp;P 500 bottomed the following Monday (3/23). This means tomorrow will mark 100 trading days since the S&amp;P 500's COVID Crash closing low. Right now the rolling 100-day percentage change for the S&amp;P 500 sits at +46.7%. But if the S&amp;P manages to trade at current levels tomorrow, the 100-day gain will jump above 50%. It has been 87 years (1933) since we've seen a 100-day gain of more than 50%!

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - New Highs In Sight

&gt; Whether you want to look at it from the perspective of closing prices or intraday levels, the S&amp;P 500 is doing what just about everybody thought would be impossible less than five months ago - approaching record highs. Relative to its closing high of 3,386.15, the S&amp;P 500 is just 0.27% lower, while it's within half of a percent from its record intraday high of 3,393.52. Through today, the S&amp;P 500 has gone 120 trading days without a record high, and as shown in the chart below, the current streak is barely even visible when viewed in the perspective of all streaks since 1928. Even if we zoom in on just the last five years, the current streak of 120 trading days only ranks as the fourth-longest streak without a new high.

&gt; While the S&amp;P 500's 120-trading day streak without a new high isn't extreme by historical standards, the turnaround off the lows has been extraordinary. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been ten prior declines of at least 20% from a record closing high. Of those ten prior periods, the shortest gap between the original record high and the next one was 309 trading days, and the shortest gap between highs that had a pullback of at least 30% was 484 tradings days (or more than four times the current gap of 120 trading days). For all ten streaks without a record high, the median drought was 680 trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/Streaks-Chart.png))**

&gt; Whenever the S&amp;P 500 does take out its 2/19 high, the question is whether the new high represents a breakout where the S&amp;P 500 keeps rallying into evergreen territory, or does it run out of gas after finally reaching a new milestone? To shed some light on this question, we looked at the S&amp;P 500's performance following each prior streak of similar duration without a new high.

&gt; # Rocket Reversals

&gt; Over the last few days, we've been seeing a moderate rotation in the market as red-hot growth stocks sell-off and investors shift into other areas of the market that have been lagging. To highlight this, the table below highlights 24 companies in the Russell 3,000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that traded at a 52-week high within the last month but are currently down more than 20% from that high. The vast majority of these stocks are names that investors haven't been able to get enough of in 2020 but now appear to have had their fill.

&gt; Topping the list of these reversals is Eastman Kodak (KODK). On 7/29, the stock surged to a 52-week high of $60.00 after being awarded a questionable government contract to domestically produce components for prescription drugs. With the SEC and government agency that originally awarded the contract now looking into stock option awards at the company just before it was announced, the stock has pulled back sharply and is now down over 80% from its high less than two weeks ago.

&gt; While KODK is more of a unique example, other names on the list are primarily growth or health care stocks that have benefited from the COVID outbreak. However, now that signs suggest the summer wave in the south has crested, investors appear to be taking some profits. Shares of Vaxart (VXRT) hit a high of $17.49 on July 14th but have since lost nearly half of their value and trade back in the single-digits. Additionally, Bloom Energy (BE), 1Life Healthcare (ONEM), and Bioxcel Therapeutics (BTAI) have all lost more than a third of their value.

&gt; In terms of market cap, most of the names listed are on the small side, but Tesla (TSLA) is a notable exception as it is now just over 20% below its 52-week high on 7/13. Other relatively large companies on the list include Moderna (MRNA), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Teladoc (TDOC), and Livongo (LVGO). TDOC and LVGO both hit all-time highs last week but after announcing a mostly stock merger last Wednesday, both have lost nearly a quarter of their value.

&gt; While all of the stocks listed below have seen sharp pullbacks in the last several days, a little perspective is in order. Of the 24 names listed, the average YTD change even after the declines has been a gain of 219.7% (median: +94.6%). Only two of the stocks shown (New Relic- NEWR and Sonos- SONO) are down YTD, and half of them have at least doubled and in many cases much more.

I am a 27-year-old who is looking to create a steady strategy based around buying ETFs on a weekly basis. My end goal here is to buy a house or potentially move internationally in 10 years - this also aligns with the conclusion of my student debt. I am looking for a few funds that I can simply buy into on a rotating basis each week.

I have been doing a bit of a beta test on this and currently hold QQQ, VOO, and VOOG. I am bullish on tech over the next 10 years, but that said I feel over-leveraged at this time and would like to correct that. **I would love people's opinions on this, but I am thinking that I will do 40% VOO, 20% tech ETF, 10% international ETF, 10% real estate related ETF, 20% VTI. Do y'all friendly folks have recommendations for ETFs that fall into those respective categories? Would also love any opposition to my allocations above.**

I know the discussion of ETFs is common and I have read many posts about this prior to posting. I have used past posts to create the above framework and would love to have a discussion about this strategy. I was brought up in a family with very little financial literacy so I do not have many places other than the internet to talk this stuff through. Ultimately my goal is to be debt-free and in a position to buy a house 10 years out.

Markets are dipping slightly as the S&amp;P 500 nears record highs. The trend is still up and if nothing changes we could close at record highs today.

The Buffett indicator which compares global stock prices to global GDP is showing signs that the market is overbought. We only have a few data points so I'm not convinced this is 100% accurate.

I mentioned last week the market is pricing in a Biden victory with no reaction to Trump-China tensions. Goldman Sachs has noted Biden's tax policy if passed in its current state could negatively impact some consumer stocks.

Overall markets appear to be less choppy as the dog days of summer roll on. I've run the same scanners all year and I'm getting fewer stocks worth watching this week.

**Watchlist:**

**HX** is a low float, on watch

**ARPO** is a lowish float, resistance at $1.90

**GRWG** watching for a setup above $12.75

**TACO** has support at $8.41

Apple and Tesla, arguably two of the hottest companies on [Wall Street](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing), both announced stock splits in recent weeks. The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, let’s understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be ‘too high’. For example, in Tesla 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.

A stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split. Since many retail investors find the stock now more affordable, they end up boosting demand and driving up prices. A stock split also reminds investors that the share price had been increasing in the past. It is not surprising that many investors extrapolate the historical growth into the future and bid up the share price again. One thing to also note is that even though the number of outstanding shares increases and stock price decreases, the market capitalization doesn’t change.

# Who Tend To Benefit From Stock Splits?

Generally speaking, stock splits are neutral events for current shareholders. In the case of the Apple 4-for-1 stock split, you used to own 1 stock, but moving forward you will own 4, but the total value remains the same. Essentially, a stock split wouldn’t change the company value, all else being equal. But the truth is, all else is rarely equal when we apply it in the market.

Both TSLA stock and AAPL stock jumped after the announcement. This may be the fifth time for Apple to do a stock split, but it is Tesla’s first. The price change will be more dramatic for Tesla, whose stock split will bring individual share to the $300 range. Compared to Apple’s post-split of $100 range, Tesla’s post-split stock might find it harder to attract smaller investors.

Certain online brokerages offer investors to buy fractional stocks. Conceptually, it offers the same thing in the absence of stock splits. Then again, not all brokerages will offer such services and it’s not that easy to move shares between brokerages. Therefore, it will not create a much stronger demand than actual stock splits. Now, like it or not, news of stock splits tend to cause share prices to jump. And that is not really rational. But who cares? As long as the prices go up, existing shareholders would not be complaining.

## Tesla &amp; Apple’s Stock Splits Could Restart The Trend Again.

Is stock splits a thing in the past? Tracing back the history, in 1997, 102 companies in the [S&amp;P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) split their stocks, and in 2016, only 7 companies did so, a decline of more than 90%. That is about to change when two of the hottest tech companies announced they will be splitting their shares at the end of this month. The zero brokerage fees environment gives companies a greater incentive to split shares today. In addition, it creates a more affordable and accessible stock for Robinhood traders to start trading. After all, many retail investors are nonetheless still prone to judging how “expensive” a stock is based on its dollar value. That said, it is not surprising to see other tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, or Alphabet make such moves in their own timeline.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,497753,public,confidence,self,Apple &amp; Tesla Announced Stock Splits; Here’s How It Could Impact Your Investments,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/i8zf3r/apple_tesla_announced_stock_splits_heres_how_it/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Public cord blood banks accept donations to be used for anyone in need, and as such function like public blood banks. Traditionally, public cord blood banking has been more widely accepted by the medical community. Private cord blood banks store cord blood solely for potential use by the donor or donor's family. Today I'd like to dive into the real current advantages and disadvantages and the possible future development of this business.

**What it is cord blood?**  
 Cord blood is the blood that remains in the umbilical cord after a baby is born. Throughout pregnancy, the umbilical cord functions as the lifeline between mom and baby, carrying nutrient-rich, oxygenated blood from the placenta to the developing baby.

**Why is cord blood so special?**  
Cord Blood contains special cells called hematopoietic stem cells which can mature into different types of blood cells in the body. On the other side, other cells can make copies only of themselves, for example a skin cell can make another skin cell.  
Hematopoietic stem cells can be used to treat more than 70 types of diseases, including diseases of the immune system, genetic disorders, neurologic disorders, and some forms of cancer, including leukaemia and lymphoma.

**What are the advantages of cord blood?**  
Stem cells from cord blood can be given to more people, more matches are possible when a transplant is needed and is less likely to cause rejection than those in bone marrow. Also is much harder collect bone marrow than cord blood and it can be painful for the donor.   
Cord blood can be frozen and stored, bone marrow must be used soon after it is collected, and bone marrow stem cells cannot be used to strengthen the immune system during cancer treatments.

**What are the disadvantages of cord blood?**  
Cord blood does not contain many stem cells, but units from several donors can be combined to increase the number of stem cells if a transplant is needed for an adult. Also a child’s stem cells (collected at birth) cannot be used to treat genetic diseases in that child and cannot be used to treat that child’s leukaemia because all of the stem cells have the same genes that cause the disease. But the child can use someone’s else stem cells (the donor can be a relative or be unrelated to the child) but there must be a good match between donor and recipient. A donor is a good match when certain things about his or her cells and the recipient’s cells are alike. 

 E.g. Brothers and sisters with the same biological parents have a 25% chance of being a perfect match, and a 50% chance of being a partial match.  Other family members are much less likely to be a match.

Sometimes not enough cord blood can be collected if the baby is preterm or if it is decided to delay clamping of the umbilical cord, (which means the umbilical cord is not clamped immediately after birth. Instead, it is clamped and cut between one and three minutes after birth) practice that can reduce the volume of stem cells remaining in the umbilical cord. The reality is the chance for an individual to use his or her own blood is miniscule and factors like limited cell dose cord blood units and inability to use one's own stem cells in genetic disorders have conveniently been overlooked by advertisement campaigns. For instance, Frances Verter, Ph.D., and founder of Parent’s Guide to Cord Blood Foundation, estimates there is only a 1 in 217 chance that your child will ever need a stem cell transplant with cord blood.

**Why take stem cells from cord and not from other sources?**  
You can take stem cells from cord, bone marrow and peripheral blood. But taking stem cells from cord it is more beneficial for the following reasons:

· Unlike cells from adult donors, cord blood has not been as exposed to viruses, chemicals and environmental pollutants that can alter cell function. 

· Cord blood immune cells are immature and can tolerate a recipient better than adult cells, so cord blood cells do not have to be matched as closely to the patient as do cells from adult donors.

· Cord blood may be accessed more quickly than stem cells from an adult donor who may have registered for donation years ago.  The donor must be located, consented, tested, and harvested.

**Why are you telling us this?**  
Not many knows that there are cord blood banks, which basically are facilities which stores umbilical cord blood for future use.

There are two available options:

*Public cord banks* do not charge anything for storage. Any donation made is available for anyone who needs it. The bank may also use the donated cord blood for research.

*Private (commercial) cord banks* will store the donated blood for use by the donor and family members only. They can be expensive. These banks charge a fee for processing and an annual fee for storage.

**How do they do it?**  
The service consists of four key procedures:

· *Cord Blood Collection:* Takes place in hospitals immediately after the babies are born and is conducted by qualified doctors or trained midwife nurses. Once stored, the samples are picked up and delivered to their laboratories within 24 hrs with special courier vehicles. Upon arrival they will examine the blood to determine if it meets certain standards and it will be assigned a specific barcode.

· *Cord Blood Processing:* Rooms built strictly following national GMP standards (1000 class clean rooms and 100 class clean benches). Process consist of separation of stem cell by removing red blood cells and plasma. 

· *Laboratory Testing:* More than 20 tests need to be performed for each cord blood units before it is distributed for use, including infectious diseases tests, HPC tests, HLA typing et al.

· *Cord Cryopreservation:* The processed cord blood units are first gradually frozen using a controlled-rate freezer to lower their temperature to -90˚C before they can be transferred into the liquid nitrogen tanks (-196˚C) for long-term storage. There are computerized security systems including fingerprint door locks, smoke sensors, oxygen content monitors, 24-hours liquid nitrogen monitoring and alarm system and infrared alarm system.

**Does the business have upside potential in the future?**  
Many believes that such business could do great in the future, but after doing our proper researches and talked with people in the industry we believe that it’s too soon to make speculative predictions about the future development of cord blood needing.

The reasons that leads us to that conclusions are the following (we are taking into consideration only Private Cord Blood Banking):

· In over 98% of birds, cord blood is thrown away as medical waste because of a lack of awareness and education about cord blood. But we do not believe that percentage will change significantly in the future since Private Cord Blood Banking is expensive (2,000$ to 4,000$ fee for processing and annual fees for storage of 200$ to 400$). Even if they manage to educate more families about potentials benefit of cord banking, many will not do it because of the expensive fees for doing so. We believe that families will prefer to donate cord blood to public banks, which charge no fees.

· Collect or donate cord blood is not a last-minute decision, expecting parents should talk to their obstetrical physician or other health care provider between the 28th and 34th week of pregnancy about their interest in storing or donating a baby’s cord blood.

· Given the importance and hope parents attach to the idea of protecting their children’s future health, many decided to store cord blood but were not aware about the real chances of their baby needing it because of the misleading information given from advertisement campaigns.

· When we asked to competent doctors what they think about private cord blood banking they do not recommend banking cord blood on the slight chance that your baby will need stem cells someday. If your baby were to need stem cells, he or she would probably need stem cells from someone else rather than his or her own stem cells.

 Dr. Michelle Hudspeth is the director of adult and pediatric blood &amp; marrow transplantation at the Medical University of South Carolina. She said, “We do not recommend privately banking cord blood unless you have a first-degree relative who has a disorder that can be cured by cord blood transplant. And that is going to be such a tiny amount of people.”

**In conclusion**  
Experts encourage to donate to public banking because of chances of needing it are low given the high costs of privately storing it. However, in 2019 there was a new theory that says cord blood storing could be useful for NK (Natural Killer) cells which are particularly important because they kill cancer cells without needing prior activation. These cells play a role in the autoimmune response and are involved in the development of pathologies such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Researchers found one unit of cord blood could yield enough NK cells to treat five patients.

Also, Cord blood holds great promise in regenerative medicine to potentially treat autism, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, stroke, spinal cord injury and more.

As research continues to bridge the gap between the unknown and the proven, we may see the popularity in NK and other umbilical cell products rise. The possibility to manufacture NK cells with coronavirus antibodies would be an innovative concept and could serve as a treatment option to advance in the upcoming years. The logistics surrounding engineered cord blood NK cells may deliver a nearly immediate solution in response to the limitations associated with current cell therapies.

That’s why we believe it’s “too soon”, for the moment; given the current data we have found and considering our approach to investments, we do not believe that Private Cord Blood Banking companies are a value pick, but looking at the potential benefits it could have in the future we strongly recommend to keep an eye on the development of this sector.

I received a lot of questions asking what I looked for in an ideal IPO setup, and thoughts on a few of the IPOs coming up this week.

First off, I'm not an expert on any of this, just sharing what has worked for me. I certainly don't recommend trying my strategies on every IPO; I am specifically hunting for IPOs that soar out the gate, and have given detailed instructions on how to buy in at the optimal entry point (right when the stock starts trading), and recommend setting stop losses to mitigate losses in case the stock doesn't  run up as anticipated. 

That being said, I certainly am on the look out for indicators that signal a high demand for the stock, as well as media coverage to further increase awareness of the stocks IPO (ideally positive).

Well, DCT is certainly lining up in the right formation for me to take another all-in play, starting with favorable coverage by SeekingAlpha and TechCrunch, followed up by the announcement 8 hours ago that they are raising the IPO price range from $19-21 to $23-25 per share.

An IPO price at $25 or above and a pre-debut price above $50 would all be very reassuring. If it follows this trend, as expected, I'll be tracking the pre-debut price before the stock starts trading on Friday, raising my limit orders to $2 above the Ask price as it moves prior to the debut to buy shares right at the debut price.

I will probably look to take profits at the end of the day unless I get stopped out early (which would mean this stock didn't boom as much as I anticipate).  I expect this to follow NCNO's footprint more than LMND or BIGC and not have much of a second day pop, but have not tracked enough of these to feel very confident in my ability to forecast that, but also just to avoid holding through the weekend.

Stock splits are entirely harmless to one\'s ownership in stock and have no impact on your position from a fundamental standpoint. However, it is still valuable to understand what a stock split is and why businesses undertake these activities.\xa0\n\nStock splits are an increasingly less common occurrence in financial markets. However, stock splits still occur and may be confusing as new investors see changes to the number of shares they own and the price of a stock that announces a split. Stock splits are done for several reasons that involve psychology and exchange requirements.\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What New Investors Get Wrong About Stock Splits**\n\nThe most important aspect to understand regarding stock splits is that they cause no economic change to the company. Stock splits are purely to lower a company\'s stock price to allow more individuals to purchase stock. A stock split is when a company increases the number of shares outstanding and, as a result, decreases the share price. Stock splits are usually announced in ratio terms such as ""3-for-1,"" signifying how many shares an investor will receive for each of their already owned shares. For example, Apple announced a ""4-for-1"" stock split in July of 2020 when the stock was trading at approximately $400 per share. If you owned one share of Apple stock, you would have received four shares in exchange for the one share you already owned, and the price of each share would change to approximately $100 (4 x less) per share. The value of your investment in this example does not change, as the total value was $400 before the split and remains at $400.\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why Do Companies Split Stocks?**\n\nCompanies usually announce stock splits to make their shares more accessible to retail investors interested in investing by lowering the cost of each share. By reducing the cost of shares, retail investors can gain access to shares they may not have been able to afford. In theory, you may be thinking that this would drive a company\'s stock up and maybe a good sign for a company. However, the minuscule amount of capital provided by these retail investors interested in a company does not really impact the stock price at all. In the modern age of computer trading, most brokerages offer fractional shares of stock, which means that a person could buy 0.5 shares of a stock trading at $100 per share for $50. This fractional trading has made stock splits much less common than they were in the 1980s and 90s. However, large companies, such as Apple, may choose to do this merely as a psychological marketing tactic to appeal to those who want to own entire shares but can\'t do so.\xa0\n\nAlso, stock splits can sometimes be seen as a sign of confidence in a particular stock. It could be argued that a company that is willing to split its stock from $100 per share to $20 per-share is confident about the future growth of its stock price. While stock splits have no direct connection to the financial health or future performance of a company, some believe that they signify future strength to come for business. As a result, stocks can often rise after a stock split is announced, as Apple did because it is believed that company executives are confident in the future of the business.\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Different Types of Splits**\n\nAnother type of stock split is known as a reverse stock split. A reverse stock split is the exact opposite of a regular stock split. While a regular stock split seeks to reduce the price of shares by issuing more shares, a reverse stock split aims to raise the price of individual shares by merging existing shares. A reverse stock split essentially lowers the number of shares outstanding, which results in a higher stock price. Reverse stock splits are also announced in ratio terms such as ""1-for-3"". In a ""1-for-3,"" reverse stock split example, an individual who owns three shares of stock X trading at $1 per-share would receive one share that costs $3 per share. The value of your investment in this example does not change just as with regular stock splits, as the total amount was $3 before the split and remains at $3.\xa0\n\nReverse stock splits are typically a terrible sign compared to the generally positively received regular stock splits. Companies perform reverse stock splits when the stock price has usually reached record lows. Companies will perform reverse stock splits to raise the share price to above the minimum level required by some exchanges. Both the NASDAQ and NYSE require that stock prices remain above $1 per-share to stay listed on the exchanges. If a company\'s stock has fallen close to $1, they may consider a reverse stock split to raise its share price to remain listed on the exchange. The NYSE requires that at least 1.1M shares be traded for a company, and the NASDAQ requires that at least 1.25M shares be listed. This means that a company cannot reverse stock split forever to maintain its stock price; eventually, the stock will be delisted from the exchange and become a ""penny stock"" that trades on the OTC. Reverse stock splits are not a good sign. Don\'t be fooled by the rising stock price, as reverse stock splits do not alter the value of your investment and signal company struggles.\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNext time you see a sudden change in the number of shares you own in stock due to a stock split, don\'t be alarmed. These corporate actions do not alter the value of your investment but could potentially signal confidence around the future of the stock price. If a reverse stock split is announced, don\'t get excited that the share price has risen because it has no impact on your investment value as the number of shares you owned was proportionally decreased. If a reverse stock split was announced, consider looking for new investments as the company may be indirectly signaling tougher times ahead.\xa0', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Splits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of all the things to worry about regarding one&amp;#39;s investment, stock splits are not one of them. Stock splits are entirely harmless to one&amp;#39;s ownership in stock and have no impact on your position from a fundamental standpoint. However, it is still valuable to understand what a stock split is and why businesses undertake these activities.\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stock splits are an increasingly less common occurrence in financial markets. However, stock splits still occur and may be confusing as new investors see changes to the number of shares they own and the price of a stock that announces a split. Stock splits are done for several reasons that involve psychology and exchange requirements.\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What New Investors Get Wrong About Stock Splits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important aspect to understand regarding stock splits is that they cause no economic change to the company. Stock splits are purely to lower a company&amp;#39;s stock price to allow more individuals to purchase stock. A stock split is when a company increases the number of shares outstanding and, as a result, decreases the share price. Stock splits are usually announced in ratio terms such as &amp;quot;3-for-1,&amp;quot; signifying how many shares an investor will receive for each of their already owned shares. For example, Apple announced a &amp;quot;4-for-1&amp;quot; stock split in July of 2020 when the stock was trading at approximately $400 per share. If you owned one share of Apple stock, you would have received four shares in exchange for the one share you already owned, and the price of each share would change to approximately $100 (4 x less) per share. The value of your investment in this example does not change, as the total value was $400 before the split and remains at $400.\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do Companies Split Stocks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Companies usually announce stock splits to make their shares more accessible to retail investors interested in investing by lowering the cost of each share. By reducing the cost of shares, retail investors can gain access to shares they may not have been able to afford. In theory, you may be thinking that this would drive a company&amp;#39;s stock up and maybe a good sign for a company. However, the minuscule amount of capital provided by these retail investors interested in a company does not really impact the stock price at all. In the modern age of computer trading, most brokerages offer fractional shares of stock, which means that a person could buy 0.5 shares of a stock trading at $100 per share for $50. This fractional trading has made stock splits much less common than they were in the 1980s and 90s. However, large companies, such as Apple, may choose to do this merely as a psychological marketing tactic to appeal to those who want to own entire shares but can&amp;#39;t do so.\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, stock splits can sometimes be seen as a sign of confidence in a particular stock. It could be argued that a company that is willing to split its stock from $100 per share to $20 per-share is confident about the future growth of its stock price. While stock splits have no direct connection to the financial health or future performance of a company, some believe that they signify future strength to come for business. As a result, stocks can often rise after a stock split is announced, as Apple did because it is believed that company executives are confident in the future of the business.\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Types of Splits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another type of stock split is known as a reverse stock split. A reverse stock split is the exact opposite of a regular stock split. While a regular stock split seeks to reduce the price of shares by issuing more shares, a reverse stock split aims to raise the price of individual shares by merging existing shares. A reverse stock split essentially lowers the number of shares outstanding, which results in a higher stock price. Reverse stock splits are also announced in ratio terms such as &amp;quot;1-for-3&amp;quot;. In a &amp;quot;1-for-3,&amp;quot; reverse stock split example, an individual who owns three shares of stock X trading at $1 per-share would receive one share that costs $3 per share. The value of your investment in this example does not change just as with regular stock splits, as the total amount was $3 before the split and remains at $3.\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reverse stock splits are typically a terrible sign compared to the generally positively received regular stock splits. Companies perform reverse stock splits when the stock price has usually reached record lows. Companies will perform reverse stock splits to raise the share price to above the minimum level required by some exchanges. Both the NASDAQ and NYSE require that stock prices remain above $1 per-share to stay listed on the exchanges. If a company&amp;#39;s stock has fallen close to $1, they may consider a reverse stock split to raise its share price to remain listed on the exchange. The NYSE requires that at least 1.1M shares be traded for a company, and the NASDAQ requires that at least 1.25M shares be listed. This means that a company cannot reverse stock split forever to maintain its stock price; eventually, the stock will be delisted from the exchange and become a &amp;quot;penny stock&amp;quot; that trades on the OTC. Reverse stock splits are not a good sign. Don&amp;#39;t be fooled by the rising stock price, as reverse stock splits do not alter the value of your investment and signal company struggles.\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time you see a sudden change in the number of shares you own in stock due to a stock split, don&amp;#39;t be alarmed. These corporate actions do not alter the value of your investment but could potentially signal confidence around the future of the stock price. If a reverse stock split is announced, don&amp;#39;t get excited that the share price has risen because it has no impact on your investment value as the number of shares you owned was proportionally decreased.

Markets are pointing towards a higher open this morning after the federal government announced it's bought 100 million vaccine doses of Moderna (**MRNA**). It had already bought 100 million doses from Pfizer (**PFE**).

Russia is putting a lightly tested vaccine into the population. Many skeptics on this because there is no data available to prove it's effectiveness.

Ok so i am 18 right now have 500$ portfolio in common stocks what i am thinking is a 7 year goal from now and i need help from ppl for their opinion

I have some amount or money saved like an emergency fund and in September i will be starting university and i will also continue workin part time and here is what i am calculating for my long term investment 

I will invest 200$ in stocks which pay good dividends every month (so like 50$ every paycheck)

200$*12 months = 2400$
2400$*7years = 16800$
Every summer of the year i will invest a 1000$ extra so= +7000$
Total=23800$
round up to 25000$ 

By the age of 25 if u take a average dividend including inflation(which affects both ways) and average stock market growth let’s say like 8% dividend income it will be 2250$ per year and 2250/12 roughly 180$/month

I will get 180$/ month as dividend income which will eventually pay my student loan for university

I do try to avoid the mainstream techier companies cause i feel theyre being piled on too much. Otherwise please gimme more ideas.

My positions are 50% PBW (Renewable NRG), 25% ESPO (Videogames), 20% BOTZ (automation), and 15% YOLO (devils lettuce)

My reasoning:

Renewables: already making fast progress with a government that hates it. If dems get into office... it will only go up at a faster pace than now.

Marijuana: same thing. On top of that states are bankrupt and MJ taxes are looking real tasty to some broke ass states.

Videogames: A fucking habit. People dont just stop and corona just fast tracked its growth.

Automation and Robotics: This one is obvious.

So it's becoming clear that states are going bankrupt due to COVID and looking for ways to generate revenue.

One of the most talked about ways is to legalize and tax sports betting. Especially after the success of New Jersey, the state has brought in over [$60M](https://deadspin.com/the-odds-of-sports-gambling-legalization-in-a-pandemic-1844078634) since legalizing sports betting.

It's looking like 2/3 of the US will have some sort of sports betting by the end of 2021.

Which public companies are primed to take advantage of sports betting legalization?

I'm using this [list](https://assetdash.com/?sectors=Gamble) to find co's in the sector - these look like the top players:

1. Las Vegas Sands ($38B) - but apparently their chairman is anti-online gaming.
2. Draftkings ($24B) - pretty steep valuation no?
3. VICI ($12B)
4. MGM ($10B)
5. Melco ($9B)
6. Wynn ($9B)
7. Churchill Downs ($6B)
8. Penn ($6B) - Barstool can market but anyone else worried about debt?
9. Boyd ($3B)
10.

The main reason I'm writing this, is because during last week's BigCommerce IPO, there were a lot of question on how to play the IPO once the stock hit the market, ranging from ""When does the stock start trading"", to ""How much will it cost when it debuts"", to ""Why is the debut price so much higher than the stated IPO price?""...

I made $20k on a $35 investment on BigCommerce (Turned $35k into $55k), and have now played 7 IPOs without a loss, but this was the first one I really nailed. I'm gonna go in depth on what I've learned over the past 4 years trading IPOs, and share with you a strategy that I really nailed down in the past few months.

I'm specifically talking about buying an stock on the day of the IPO once the stock starts trading. For most of us who do not have substantial capital in our accounts, or whose brokers don't get access to many IPOs at the listing price, the best we can do is buy the stock once it is actively trading on the open market (the 'debut').

While it sounds pretty straight forward, buying a stock on the day of its IPO is rather tricky, since you don't know exactly when it will start trading, or at what price it will actually debut on the open market, and since the price often moves very quickly once it starts trading, you want to be able to buy in as soon as possible, especially for a super hot IPO - and there IS a way to get stock the minute it debuts on the market.

To give you an idea of what you can accomplish - in the LMND, NCNO, and BIGC IPOs, you could relatively easily made about 50% on your money on each of these within a day of the IPO.

IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND - not every IPO is going to soar, you need to be selective, you need to take precautions to limit your downside, and the goal here is to make the right moves on a stock that DOES take off once it debuts off it's IPO while not losing money, or at least limiting your losses, when the IPO is a dud.

First, some quick background info to get everyone up to speed, since it does help to prepare you for playing the IPO the day a stock debuts trading:

An IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a private company, often a startup, initially lists their company's shares for sale on the public markets. The purpose of this is typically for a company to raise money - they sell shares to the public and use the proceeds from those sold shares to grow their business. Another reason a company will 'go public' is so that employees, investors, and owners of the company can realize a capital gain (make money) from the stock they own/have earned as they founded and grew out the company.

Traditionally, a company will hire established Investment Banks to promote their IPO to institutional investors (pension funds, hedge funds, etc), in order to build out a substantial base of buyers who will purchase the shares offered in the IPO. In the weeks leading up to the IPO, the company's executive team will meet with these investors and pitch their business in order to drum up support for the IPO, and these large investors will 'subscribe' to buy a certain number of shares within an expected price range, which is ultimately determined usually the day of the IPO.

The day of the IPO.So going into the day of a major IPO, you know the range of the IPO price and you know the company will list that day, but you don't know what the debut price will be or when the stock will start trading, and this is your biggest initial challenge.

I'm already assuming the stocks I want to use this strategy for are creating a pretty big buzz in the media and social networks, so my expectation is that they will pop once they start trading. This means that within a few minutes of trading, the stock will already likely have shot up a few dollars or more, so you really want to get in right away.

KEY ENTRY STRATEGY: Set a LIMIT ORDER for a couple of dollars above the Ask Price of the stock, so you are ensured to get shares right when the stock debuts.

You will need to keep an eye on the movement of the Ask price every 5 minutes or so until you see the price start to stabilize - since you don't know exactly when the stock will start trading, you're going to need to babysit this for as long as a couple hours: adjusting your Limit Order price according to the Ask price (there are apps that can show you this key info in real time).

For example, the BIGC IPO price was $24, but the debut price started at $70 and then came down to $55 and bounced around a bit. So when the Ask price shows $55, you set your Limit Order for $57; when it goes up to $60, you adjust your Limit Order to $63. If you're like me, you're throwing all your available funds at this thing, so you need to adjust the amount of shares you want to purchase in relation to the price change.

You really have to stay on top of this, because the price can swing pretty fast, and you want to optimize the number of shares you get.

For those who don't understand Limit Orders: a Limit Order (BUY) is basically saying that you agree to pay UP TO $X.XX for the stock.

At some point, the stock will just start trading. There is no real warning, although you can sort of get a feel for it when the swings in price start getting incrementally smaller.

IF you kept your limit price above the Ask price, you SHOULD get bought in almost exactly at the debut price once the stock starts trading. If you managed to do this properly - great, for the type of IPO we're looking for, you got in at the lowest point possible.

So that covers the first part - getting INTO your trade at the optimal price - for home run IPO debuts, the price typically goes straight up.

\+++

Okay, now I'm gonna stop for a minute and talk minimizing your loss potential for when a stock does NOT go right up off the debut. Not every IPO is gonna explode, and in order to be in position to capitalize on the ones that DO explode, you're probably gonna have to play a bunch of them that are duds or just don't rocket right off the launch ramp.

For every LMND and NCNO there's a RLAY, QH, BLCT, and BLI. Granted, some of these turned out to be potential wins (BLI and RLAY), but not at the level of LMND/NCNO/BIGC - and a couple of them fell pretty significantly right after they IPOd. Even just last week, RXT did a nosedive which would have garnered a 20% loss or worse.

The good news is, that almost all of these stocks experienced a slight bump in the first few minutes after they debuted. If I'm not incredibly confident in a stock, I'm gonna set a Stop Loss either right at my entry point or slightly below it. If it get's triggered, oh well, either no loss or a small loss, and I just accept that even if the stock recovers, at least I haven't lost money. The real winners with huge gains are usually obvious from the start.

I'm gonna say this again just to make my point. Set your Stop Loss for whatever amount you feel comfortable losing, and do it right away. It's okay to lose a little. The home run plays don't do a big dip right out the gate - they run off pretty much straight from the starting line. You really don't want to be sweating it out while a stock dittles around the debut price for the day.

One mistake I made with the LMND and NCNO IPOs was raising my Stop Loss amount as the stock popped. Had I simply left my Stop Loss at my entry point, it would not have been triggered at all, but raising it incrementally as the stock price shot up caused it to get triggered on a down swing before the stocks ultimately went far beyond the initial spike.

The anatomy of the stock charts for the home run plays look very similar, particularly in the first 30 minutes of trading. A big jump off the debut price, with an initial spike. BIGC triggered two circuit breakers on the way from $68 to $93 before coming back down to the low $70s before climbing up to $103 the next day. LMND and NCNO followed similar paths. You might consider just selling out a portion or all of your stock on the initial spike, but for the real home run plays, you'll be leaving money on the table if you sell of the initial spike.

HAVING A GAME PLAN

Just as it's a good idea to set your Stop Limit to control your acceptable loss, it helps to define your expectations for what you envision as a 'win'. It's not easy to time these things to perfection, so if you have some idea as to how much you would be happy to walk away with, you can exit your position if/when your target is reached, and be happy regardless of what the share price does from there.

For BIGC, $100 was my target, and I got out at $100.25. Once it went over $100 I set my stop at $100, and brought it up to $100.50 when it went to $101.00 - I got stopped out as it dropped back down from there.

To clarify that strategy: once your target price is met, instead of just selling at Market Price, set a Limit Order and see if it runs a little, while raising your limit behind the price until you get stopped out. You can also sell out in phases to average out your exit point. While I don't normally do this, it is a sensible approach.

I find that these stocks typically make a run at the end of the IPO day, and often push higher the next day. While there is no way to predict this for certain, remember that you're looking for the home run IPOs, and will inevitably play some dud IPOs along the way. The point is to NOT LOSE MONEY on the duds, while maximizing the value of the home runs.

Knowing how to read candle style charts might help you define your exit point as well, but is by no means necessary.

And another note: when you really nail it, you might consider holding onto a few shares of the stock - basically free stock - if you really believe in the company. For example, I bought in for 520 shares of BIGC @$68 and sold 470 shares @$100.25 (+$15,157.50), and kept 50 shares (@$100/share this would be $5,000).

Edit: Since first writing this piece, BIGC has come down considerably, so the shares I held onto are worth a bit less: but they were essentially paid for out of the winnings and I expect this company to be valuable long term.Playing RKT the following day would have netted a pretty big win as well, but I was too amped to focus... something for me to work on as well.

I'll be trying the same approach with BEKE, XPEV, and CVAC this week, with high hopes for DCT...

Feel free to ask me any questions, play along, or give me further pointers on how I can refine my strategy.

Smart Investing Approach (SIA) – it’s a philosophy of my thinking about investing. I have been conciously trying to develop it for at least 10 years now and I possibly tried to do it unconciously before during all the years that I have tried to survive all the ups and downs on capital markets, both professionally and in private investing. The reason why I searched for a different approach than most widely accepted ones was that I was not able to accept the cons of the usual ways on investing. The more I tried what the financial world and its professionals offered me and the bigger experience I personally gained working as a professional in capital markets, the more reluctant I was to following the usual path in finance and investing. With every other failure (and there has been many of them on my way, believe me) I felt that finding something different in how I behave, what and when I sell or buy and how I think about markets and economy, is a must. I will try to explain it below.  


I pretty much had the “pleasure” to go through every single part of getting to know financial markets from the outside and from the inside. Starting with buying certificates of open-ended investment funds when I was in my early twenties and started some student jobs, which gave me first (small) disposable savings (usual thinking: you’re young and/or don’t know much about investing, so you give some of your savings to the professionals). I noticed pretty fast though that this has clear disadvantages:  
(a) I’m effectively buying an option on a person managing the fund without any guarrantees this person (or team) will do the right job for me;  
(b) such form of investing puts my money at risk of the portfolio manager falling under the hoarding spell (or crowd thinking), i.e. say an equity fund has minimum level of equities exposure of 60% and max 100%: although this fund should have closer to 60% in equities as market booms, it’s very often the other way round (allocations close to 100% into a cycle peak);  
(c) structures of such products are very stiff – no matter what an equity fund has to have minimum 60% in equities or a corporate debt fund has to have close to 100% (minus liquidity cash buffer) in debt of corporates – why!? (some say “you can choose a mix of two or three diffrent funds with different profiles”, but the truth is that even if I do it, all the other risks in points (a) and (b) still persist for each of the chosen funds);  
(d) actively managed mutual funds hardly ever beat their benchmarks, so why buy them and not the benchmark (especially now when it’s easier and more accessible to buy a benchmark than ever)?!;  
(e) in most countries (especially from the emerging markets) the management fees are still extremely high compared to the quality of management; as an effect the fees can eat all your potential profits over the long run;  
(f) investing in mutual funds certificates very often has assymetric tax profile, meaning profit or loss on them cannot be netted out with opposite return on an investment account (that might not be the case in some countries, but definitely is here in Poland, where I live): so say I make a profit on stocks and a loss of half that on certificates, I won’t be able to decrease my capital gains tax, will still pay 19% of the gain on stocks (if I had no losses to net out from previous years).  


That got me done with investment fund certificates pretty quickly, I think around year 2006. I then considered giving some of my savings to some closed-end funds (they only collect money once and are then listed on the stock exchange, small amounts of money are accepted at inception) or hedge-funds (usually minimum amounts paid into such vehicles are substantial, so these are not really accessible to small retail investors, plus they’re less regulated and less liquid usually) employing different investment strategies (benchmarked or total return ones). The problem was, I figured, that these vehicles, although to a substantial degree different than open-ended funds, still carry most of their risks from points (a), (b), (d) and often (e) listed above, plus they often carry other risks like very limited liqudity (no possibility of getting out of an investment when an investor decides or without impact on price), often excess leverage (especially in case of hedge-funds), much smaller financial markets watchdog supervision (giving disadvantage to a holder of certificates against the issuing entity). This was not the way for me.

I then concentrated on investing by myself and in myself. Throughout my higher education in finance and banking and after I chose to pursue a career in capital markets. This decision had two major opposite implications – on one hand it pushed me into making understanding investing and how capital markets work my everyday job, but on the other hand it kind of attached me to the constant noise of information in the financial world, which can be very overwhelming in the longer run and also makes it very hard to concentrate on the so called “big picture”. As an effect of this I very often had much worse effects and returns than I could or should have, had I stayed aside and didn’t let the market crowds influence me that much. My perspective was becoming short, dependant on the noise and views of others and also very technical (in a sense that I concentrated on the current price of assets I put money into rather than their long-term value and risks). IT also constantly pushed me into using more risky instruments in managing my portfolio of assets. I am talking going from bank deposits and government bonds through bluechip dividend stocks, then mid- and small-caps, unleveraged ETFs to index derivatives, leveraged ETFs and FX trading. As I try to sit back and look at things from perspective now, the wider the portfolio of instruments was, the more the following things were happening:  
(a) my investing was more and more becoming just speculation,  
(b) involvment from my side (both mental and physical through time spent on controlling everything that impacts the positions 24 hours a day) was growing geometrically,  
(c) my feeling of control over what I was doing was falling substantially,  
(d) returns volatility was growing (especially after inception of FX and leveraged instruments) often leading to both big short-term gains as well as big short-term losses,  
(e) on average there was a negative correlation between my returns and the complexity of methods and instruments used.  


As an effect of the above I found that instead of getting better, I was actually getting worse at things I was supposed to constantly improve in, given I am considered a professional. Instead of making things simplier and more effective, I was making myself a slave of my money, my profits and my losses. I absolutely felt a growing need for more control and less time consuming way of investing (that’s the **“maximize effects while minimizing efforts”** part of what i later called SIA). Needed a system that would protect me from as many points listed above as possible. First I noticed that the instruments that are most addictive and time-consuming are the leveraged ones. If you have a position in futures or FX margin account, you are pretty much bound to watching them trade all the time, as the fact that you trade them with involvement of a margin account substantially increases the aggregate risk to your portfolio (in unfavourable circumstances or with excess leverage ratio you can quickly lose much or even all the money in your account). Besides FX markets trade practically 24 hours a day making you a slave. The conclusion was that while derivatives are obviously a must for institutional investors (for hedging and similar reasons) who have extremely easy access to funding from their prime broker-dealers and custodians, it’s not the case for a retail investor. A single person trying to run a responsible portfolio of assets does not have the capacity and has limited time to take care of such instruments in a proper way. Derivatives including margin trading must go out of the spectrum of potential instuments then (leveraged ETFs, although also risky via compounding effect, are a better choice, if someone looks to hedge, because effectively they behave more like equities, but just with higher Beta and the cost of carry is smaller compared to margin account derivatives like futures or FX, etc; it’s a topic for a different discussion really).  


 **The Birth of SIA**  


Slowly but steadily the idea of a top-down adjustment of allocations in riskiest assets of my (or any other) portfolio led by a macro model was rooting in my mind. As I was reading through different macroeconomic reasearch notes and studied macroecnomic trends, I was becoming more and more convinced that eventualy it is some kind of a macro model with strong forecasting power that will give me the protection from all the above points I mentioned in the former paragraph that caused unnecessary frustration. That’s when the foundation of SIA came to life. I think it was around year 2013, although back then it was nothing concrete, but rather a blur idea of how long-term returns could be smoothed and how the relation between achieving resonable returns and minimising (or eliminating) the inefficiencies mentioned above could look.

Over the years I also noticed the following tendencies (this is my personal perspective, others can have different views and thoughts here of course and have full right to have them):  
\-&gt; The financial industry (part of which I am too) is constantly making the atmosphere of fear of missing out (they call it MOFO i think – Missing Out FObia). You’re hearing sentences like this all the time: “the train is gone and you didn’t step in”, “index is up and fund X is better than the index, but fund Y is worse, so buy fund X!”, “this is the best Portfolio Manager, because he had a gain of 3% last quarter, whilst his competitors had smaller gains on average”, “our analysts recommend being overweight construction sector, because its high financial leverage will let boost its profits in a low rates and real estate boom environment”, “this is the last moment for investors to buy into emerging markets, chief investment officer of X Group AM says”, “value stocks have never been so cheap in history, you must not miss the opportunity!”, etc, etc). Many of these sentences are just facts OK, but very often they are aimed at creating certain kind of atmoshpere on the market convenient for those already positioned in a certain way and influencing others to behave in a certain way, which someone thinks is right at that specific point in time. That’s how capital markets are, that’s the nature of stock exchanges and capitalism, BUT the clue is not to be drawn into all this noise. There’s one thing certain in markets and investing, noone is infallable. So the worst thing you can do is let others tell you that something is good or bad for you without you actually having your own judgement in a certain matter. That’s how the **„I don’t have to, I can”** part of my future Smart Investing Approach (SIA) was born.  
\-&gt; Benchmarks don’t really make much sense. They are maybe good to measure the efficiency of PMs for the typical stiff-status portfolios I wrote above at the beginning of this post, but not for the type of investing SIA represents. Why would I compare myself to any index (be it a benhcmark for equities, bonds, treasury notes or a mixture of them)? Looking to manage a portfolio’s risk mainly by adjusting allocations in riskiest assets to the economic cycle makes it uncomparable to any index. Removing an index benchmark also removes the constant pressure of trying to be better or at least not wose than the external benchmark. SIA is supposed to make things easier and working for a person who follows it. At the end of day all that matters is that a portfolio delivers expected nominally positive returns at a certain level of risk and protects the purchasing power of money invested. So inflation and protection of long-term positive returns are the real absolute benchmarks. **No external benchmarks** in SIA.  
\-&gt; The longer I tried investing in different stocks, the more it was clear to me that it does not make sense to be a shareholder of companies that do not provide value that is really changing everyday life of the shareholder and everyone aroud him. I am talking making a real difference, not just being another company that does what other companies do. A perfect candidate for a company to become a part of a SIA-style portfolio is the one that:  
(a) Operates in a **growing sector** that has a clear bright future ahead (think of IT, SaaS, internet or green energy sectors over hard coal miners now as I write this post in 2020 – which sectors have bright and which a dark future ahead, if you think of them with a 10 year perspective? the answer is pretty clear right);  
(b) Is an **incumbent or prospective global leader** of growth in its own sector – leading companies usually attract the best managers, best specialists and widest range of investors (both institutional and retail) who all complement each other in maximising shareholder’s value in the long run (think of Yahoo! and Google at the break of centuries and now: both were positioned to become the world’s number one search engine, but eventually Google made it, whilst Yahoo! didn’t, because Google was able to maximise the efficiency of its search engine);  
(c) Operates on **growing or stable wide margins** (40%+ gross). This gives a clear advantage over other (usually older) more fixed assets or regulation heavy industries (take Miscrosoft (68% gross margin) vs. Boeing (19% gross margin) vs. Dow (15% gross margin)); usually fulfilling requirements (a) and (b) automatically matches this point as well;  
(d) Does not carry excessive debt or is **ideally debt-free**. Financial leverage (use of debt to finance growth) makes sense in some cases, when cost of debt is substantially lower than cost of equity, but as a rule companies who depend too much on debt financing become hostages of their obligations (debt must be rolled, whilst interest rates fluctuate over time constituting risk to the price of debt; liquidity management becomes crutial and any mistakes can cause a default; high levels of debt compared to generated earnings (measured usually by Net Debt/EBITDA ratio where Net Debt=Total Debt-Cash) massively increase the company’s risk, if unexpected deterioration of business conditions arise; debt holders’ claims on company’s assets have priority over equity holders in case of a default, so being a shareholder in such a company automatically puts you in a disadvantaged position),  
(e) Generates regular stream of **above-average cash flows** to the shareholders (measured by Free Cash Flow Yield= FCF/Market Capitalisation). Ideally a candidate’s FCF yield is above both the S&amp;P500 average dividend yield or risk free rate (measured by the current yield of US 10-year treasuries) or its respective local benchmarks, should the company be from outside USA).  


Slowly, but steadily all these little points of what I now call SIA were adding up into one more complex thinking about how effective investing should look like. Most of the conclusions I came to above, let’s be frank, were an effect of my own wrongdoing, misjudgment and mismanagement that often costed quite a bit of money and nerves. At least the conclusions were constructive and the process got me learning on mistakes. This old saying is very true I think: “a man learns his whole life and still dies stupid”.  


In a search for a macro model that could constitute a base for my thinking of a cycle-adjusted portfolio I have tried diggin into whatever the street’s wisest guys had to offer. I have read through the research papers of the world’s biggest investment banks whenever I had the opportunity to do it. Merrill Lynch (currently part of Bank of America), JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, HSBC, UBS and last but not least Citi (my own employer for the last 14 years until I quit to run this blog) – they all have dozens of analysts creating sophisticated macroeconomic models trying to assess the probability of a recession coming. I personally followed the most (also because it was easiest accessible for me, given I was an employee) Citigroup’s Tobias Levkovich’s model, which includes a wide mixture (close to 20) of both US macroeconomic (including yield curve, high yield credit spreads, industrial production, banks credit accessibility, etc) and microeconomic (P/E trailing, ROE, earnings revisions, net debt, etc) and sentiment indicators trying to predict whether the equities market is prone to enter a bear market. All of these models are obviously a great value added for professionals. But, however complicated they often are, they still carry the same risk of not being infallable. Besides they are just too complicated for most people in the world to read through and understand, assumed this person ever gets to reach such a report given they are mostly distributed to institutional investors only. The clue for me was to find a model that carries the following characteristics:  
(a) maximises the readability of the model’s outcomes by attaching its forecasting signals to as few indicators as possible (ideally just one),  
(b) is simple enough to be understood and followed by somone, who’s not necessarily a professional in macroeconomics or capital markets (making it useful for wide public),  
(c) has a long confirmed history of successful cycle phase change signals (especially calling peaks and throughs) ahead of them actually happening.  


After a long search I finally ran into [Dr.Robert Dieli’s](https://www.nospinforecast.com/robert-dieli/) Enhanced Aggregate Spread model (or Mr.Model), which forecasts economic cycles in a way that fulfills all the 3 elements I just mentioned above in a beautiful simple manner. Maximum readability of forecasting signals from just one easy-to-compute spread indicator that covers both the financial conditions and real economy conditions, supported buy 3 additional coincident indicators. Maximum simplicity that does not need endless amounts of different factors, spreads and indices to be covered, watched upon and updated. Accessibility to everyone, also non-professionals in the tough matter of macroeconomic forecasting. Way over half a century of data to which the model can be implemented. 80%+ forecasting success confirmed by historical data, making the model very trustworthy. A model based on “pure facts, not conjecture, thus “no spin”” as the author himself calls it. That’s exactly what I was looking for! A perfect match for my concept of cycle-adjusted investment portfolios. Dr.Dieli presents his extremely valuable work via his website under [www.nospinforecast.com](https://www.nospinforecast.com/). I sincerely advise anyone planning to implement SIA methodology to own investing procedures to visit his website and thoroughly study his work and the EAS model. Optionally you can also read my post about how EAS works and what value it gives.  


It all started adding up.  


I did actually feel more and more convinced that this kind of model can be a base for a bigger philosophy of asset allocation style, in which exposure to the riskiest part (equities) would be managed accordingly to the phase of the economic cycle. This would do a great work of smoothing out long-term returns. During the usually long periods of expansion a wise long-term portfolio should be exposed to equities, because there’s no doubt they offer the highest possible returns in the long run (on average between 8-10% annually). As long as a trustworthy forecasting model confirms the rationality of being allocated in equities with a meaningful part of a portfolio, I do not need to worry about short-term noise and corrections (which usually happen every once in a while and are no deeper than 5-15% from tops). On the other hand, when a trustworthy model is telling me something is wrong and a phase change is due, it gives me a signal early enough to prepare myself and my portfolio for what with high probability waits around the corner. When the bad (meant by recession or bear market which usually comes alongside) eventually comes I want to have as little exposure to equities as possible. It’s close to running on an autopilot, only you need to be sure the autopilot can be trusted and will bring you where you want to go without any surprises. I have later developed this way of thinking in the portolfios I now run on my blog. First to start is an allocation-only Pension Portfolio I describe and update regularly in my monthly updates. Please take a moment to read through my 1st inception post about the Pension Portfolio to understand the major assumptions of how it’s run and managed. The other portfolio is called Global Leaders Portfolio. This one does include stock picking (unlike the Pension Porfolio) in a manner compliant with the rules described above (equity part of is portfolio allocated in stocks which fulfill the following characteristics: growing sector, incumbent or prospective global leader of growth in its own sector, growing or stable wide margins, no excessive debt or is ideally debt-free, generates above-average FCF yield). It also accepts higher equities exposure,so effectively a higher-risk portfolio, not suitable for someone with low risk acceptance (please read my post on how imporant it is to measure and understand your own risk acceptance before starting to invest here.) Still the general rule is the same for all current and future SIA portfolios:  
(1) a macro forecasting model is the basic determinant of equity allocations,  
(2) equity allocations determine allocations in other assets and cash,  
(3) portfolios need to capture both worldwide growth opportunities (via equities exposure) and safety (via long term high grade sovereign debt exposure and inflation hedges and value holders like gold); this gives the porfolios an important factor of self-balancing -&gt; given the fact that gold has practically zero correlation with S&amp;P500 and long term treasuries have a negative correlation with equities, being allocated in all these 3 different types of assets always buffers your returns in the long run; when equities plunge, usually bonds and gold outperform, etc.),  
(4) their basic target is to smooth out long-term returns and avoid big one-time drawdowns.  


This is SIA then:  
\* „I don’t have to, I can” attitude  
\* no benchmarks  
\* cycle-adjusted portfolio allocations helping risk control  
\* concentration on the world’s best assets  
\* avoidance of debt overload  
\* maximization of effects with minimalization of efforts  
\* each stock must undergo a so called SIA Score process before qualifying into the portfolio:  
SIA Score:  
S1: **growing sector** 1pts/0pts,  
S2: **incumbent or prospective global leader** 1pts/0pts,  
S3: **growing or stable wide margins (40%+ gross; 3yr avg)** 2pts/0pts,  
S4: **Net Debt/EBITDA &lt;1.5** **(last 3 ended FYs)** 2pts/0pts,  
S5: **above-average cash flows** **(last 3 ended FYs)** **(FCF/MktCap &gt; S&amp;P500 Dividend Yield or US 10yr Treasry Yield (higher of the values))** 2pts/0pts;  
MAX TOTAL SCORE: 8pts/MIN TOTAL SCORE: 0pts/MIN SCORE TO QUALIFY: 4pts  


This is because I think Your money cannot control you and your time, but the other way round.  

Backtesting of the SIA shows a min +9% CAGR over the backtested span of over 20 years (2 full recessions and 3rd underway now).

One plan would toughen listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges for what the administration calls non-cooperating jurisdictions (NCJs). But this really targets China as other countries have agreements with the PCAOB.

For Chinese companies—such as tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu, Inc.—that want to continue with their listing or want to initiate listing on a U.S. exchange, the PCAOB must have access to audit work papers of the principal audit firm. Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm “with comparable resources and experience” that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.

The new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.

Details of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6.

Eastman Kodak Company shares dropped 28% in intraday trading after the federal government tweeted it was holding back a $765 million loan, pending the SEC's investigation into Kodak.

On Tuesday July 28, 2020, Kodak announced a $765 million loan from the government to support the company in manufacturing generic drug components. However, Kodak experienced unusually strong trading volume the day before this announcement. In response, the SEC launched an investigation into Kodak on Tuesday August 4, 2020 and Senator Elizabeth Warren called for a greater investigation by Congress. Kodak's board of directors has also opened an independent review. The DFC tweet about pausing the $765 million loan came shortly after these investigations, on Friday August 7, 2020.

On this news, Kodak's stocks dropped 28% in intraday trading on Monday August 10, 2020, causing significant harm to investors.

But Nikola just announced that they are pivoting to the mid sized truck market. This is actually the most profitable part of the auto industry because its where all the custom commercial trucks are at. 

Mid grade trucks like trash trucks or fire trucks often cost over a half million dollars. No other grade of trucks comes even close to the cost of the mid grade. They are routinely 2-6 times the cost of a heavy class 8 truck. 

Nikola's trucks that cost 300k cant compete in the heavy duty class against 130-200k trucks from Tesla and competitors, but they can absolutely compete in the mid grade class of custom work trucks. Some competitors have already fielded mid grade trucks, but they are so horrendous that nobody can take them seriously.

 Problem with WS is it doesn't have all the stocks, options, has 15 min delay when it comes to US stocks, and currency-conversion charges when you buy US stocks. It's the delay that puts me off, as stock market is all about timing. 

Questrade is commission based and has lots of different kind of fees involved

This is a website that tracks and ranks popular investors based on their past returns. We can then use this data and current picks from these investors to create a list of stocks that are likely to be profitable. Anyone can join and add their picks on the “trade” page to also be ranked.

Why we made this website:

When our owner began investing, He looked at Reddit, Twitter, Youtube, and Discord for potential stocks to purchase. He quickly figured out that some of these investors averaged significantly higher returns than others. He wanted a website to rank this data so he knows whom he’s investing with.

We also wanted to be as open as possible about everything that works behind the scenes. All formulas used to calculate ranks will be public. All trades and past performance will also be public.

Please if you have time visit the website and check the leaderboards. Any comments and suggestions would go a long way in improving the website. Thank you for your time.

I would also like to congratulate Yates Investing for holding the #1 spot on the leaderboard with an average return of 11.7%!

## U.S. And China Still At Odds

The U.S.-China tensions have been going from bad to worse and there’s no other way to put it. It appears to be heading to a point of no return. As if slapping tariffs at each other and cancelling trades are not bad enough. Just this year, the US regulators made it difficult for Chinese companies to list in the US stock exchanges and faces potential delisting of Chinese companies if they do not comply with the requirements. And most recently, the ban on famous Chinese apps namely TikTok and WeChat is straining the relationship further. If there’s no consensus between the U.S. and China in the TikTok deals, certain [tech stocks](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing/tech-stocks), both large and small cap in both countries are expecting to take a hit.

## Corporate Earnings Continue To Wind Down

Earnings season continues this week with another set of companies reporting quarterly earnings results, including a few newly listed companies set to announce their quarterly reports for the first time. Among those closely watched will be Lyft ([LYFT Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=LYFT)), NetEase ([NTES Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=NTES)), Canopy Growth ([CGC Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=CGC)). The fresh faces making their first public announcement this week are Lemonade ([LMND Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=LMND)), ZoomInfo Technologies ([ZI Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=ZI)) and Vroom Inc ([VRM Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=VRM)).

Some of these companies have seen soaring stock prices. The earnings releases will likely provide a reality check for the enthusiastic investors. The newly listed companies have at least doubled in stock prices. Yet, they have so far not seen much significant news that can affect their stock prices.

This came as investors continue to be optimistic about the prospects of these newly public companies. Perhaps they are afraid of missing out on the expected growth. With a lack of company guidance, it remains to be seen how the market will react. After all, the market doesn’t necessarily agree with analysts’ consensus.

## Defensive Sectors To Rise, Value Stocks Gain

It’s certainly an interesting year for financial markets. It’s easy not to notice that the [S&amp;P 500 Index](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) is now just around 1% below its record high. Recent gainers included defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate. Tech stocks which were the primary driver of the market rally since March appear to be taking the back seat now. Does that mean we are expecting to see a decline in Nasdaq Composite or the rise in “reopening stocks” this week? Fundstrat’s Tom Lee agrees with the latter.

The reopening stocks, also called “epicenter stocks” by Lee, are stocks that should benefit from a steady reopening of the US economy. These include the travel, leisure, and hospitality sectors. With the research carried out by his team in Fundstrat, they conclude that the epicenter stocks are set to outperform sometime this week. He pointed to Friday’s unemployment report, which showed a 50% retracement of jobs lost since the pandemic began. That to him, signals that the economy is healthy and recovering. Of course, he could be wrong too. Ultimately, we need to see how investors react to market sentiments and see if these epicenter stocks could really gain momentum to have another “monstrous rally” before these cyclical stocks could rally big.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,495239,public,confidence,self,Top 4 Things To Know In The Stock Market This Week,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/i74eah/top_4_things_to_know_in_the_stock_market_this_week/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'k-CKp3wIh0hCxtWWaAoorpgpK5ZqEUSrGUaJ1uG-3wU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 11, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27594d395f3315b951ace2fad82d1ee6afd17085', 'width': 108}, {'height': 23, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14f2795e52c81fb604aa512af51c9e8a61b2546c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 35, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99552db7d3eb3da6bc14b4b58cec31dceadc66f6', 'width': 320}, {'height': 70, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=109989fea44209a977a2514783ea70ef64589997', 'width': 640}, {'height': 105, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1bf68bd8e68c369ceed723204aea1660a2755dd', 'width': 960}, {'height': 118, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1007a781274d6409b90b6efe4e9377379872d19b', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 195, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=526c8d12ad23c681526ba64357050fe7e8eb6fa4', 'width': 1779}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

The massive   collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality   the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been  paying  attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical  decisions  Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications  of that on  their future.

**Lithography techniques**

Lithography   is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible   competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a   template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and   shine a powerful laser on it [\[1\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).

Over   time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this   would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption   and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\[2\]. This becomes   progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram   transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a   hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm   mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design   became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the   complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of   thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than   one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with   each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet,   using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel   saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm   process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on   its’ 10nm process.\[3\] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung  chose  EUV. \[4\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to  pursue EUV  for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to  which was the  right choice…

Other  terminology  I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a  wafer is  actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of  the wafer  as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed  from  several pieces of silicon stuck together)

**The problems with 10nm**

Back   in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with   &gt;90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’   chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the   alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In   the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’   of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’   never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released,   10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake   in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not   hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in   2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior   performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. \[5\] The latest update is that   desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 –  but  for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet   again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total  writeoff,  and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage  have doomed  it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you  are bound to  have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating  billions of  devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect.  Patterning as a  lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect  rate than not  using it – you’re basically going through the same  process multiple  times, thus increasing the chance of defect  dramatically. As I mentioned  earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in  10nm – this means their  defect rates are going to be sky high. At the  same time, their usage of a  monolithic die compounds this problem for  high-performance, high core  count CPU models. As you can see from the  blue wafer below, it’s  difficult to draw large squares (high-core count  models) that are  without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s  chiplet approach,  built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process.

(Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here)

Since   you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you  use  a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting  you  freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to  build.

Of  course, it’s impossible  for anyone outside Intel to know the exact  numbers for the defect  rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt  they are improving as  time goes on,as they always do with a maturing  architecture. However, I  can say with certainty that

1. they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS
2. The   margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has   traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the   last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole   product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%.   The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only   by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance.   If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy   margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5   year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers   would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues.

These   are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few   years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.

When   you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it   be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly   obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent   flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer   architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own   previous-generation Phenom II architecture \[6\], leading to   near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising   core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the   future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs,   massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture.   Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design   choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce   10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly   continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs.   Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4  cores.  However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count  capable Zen  architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising  their own core  counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core  counts across  their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with  its’ double  patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of  10nm mean that  current generation chips at the same price point from  Intel have 14nm  massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core  counts outweighing  any density improvements that 10nm brings.  Similarly, leaks for the  upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake  Xeon chips suggest that  the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will  be 33-50% lower than those  from 14nm \[7\] – not to mention AMD’s  offerings which top out at 2.3x  the core count at half the price.\[8\]  The persistent lack of chips on  10nm that can outperform their  predecessors, despite us now technically  being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests  that there is a fundamental barrier in the  technology that no amount of  delays and extra engineering can get past.  10nm is rotten from the  very first steps taken.

**7nm and beyond**

So   now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process   is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built  on  the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it  to  be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was   widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t   have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just   want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2  call  were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our   internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield   degradation’.

There’s quite a  lot  to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call,  were  confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at  the  same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The  truth is  that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the  reason, while  technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any  typical launch of a  new process node, you spend a few months getting up  to speed – running  the foundry through the whole process,  troubleshooting, using the  produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM  partners for them to design  products around, etc. You don’t sell the  chips produced to anyone.  Industry standard is to call this period a  tape-out, not a launch of a  new process – that’s when you actually  produce chips that you sell to  people. Bob’s comment translated is that  the process is delayed by 12  months, but they’re going to breach  industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm  when the first fabs start spinning  up 6 months before they have chips in  any volume. Sound ridiculous?  Well, Intel did the exact same thing with  10nm. Faced with mounting  pressure over the constant delays, Intel  ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May  2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole  generation, a dual core processor  with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was  slower than the i3-3250 released  in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm  part. Not to mention it was nigh on  impossible to actually buy one.\[9\]  Cannon Lake was an incredibly  obvious paper launch, released to appease  investors at a time where  Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake,  the first 10nm  architecture you could actually buy (in limited  quantities) shipped in  September 2019, more than a year after Cannon  Lake ‘launched’. This  ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to  sweetcoat a 12 month  delay (assuming no further delays).

The   second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as   interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology   for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information  suggesting  they might move away from this if it proves to be too  difficult. \[10\]  GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is  a new and  unproven transistor technology that should overcome the  technical  difficulties current transistor technologies face at  increasingly  smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is  going to a  completely new type of transistor and we only have one other  comparable  in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few  years ago.  With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working  prototype’  demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \[11\]  Meanwhile,  the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years  ago.

\[12\]  While FinFeT and  GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the  plans from  Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly  ambitious. The  latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have  ran into has to  do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true,  you could easily  see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.

Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/)   As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV   and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage   in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm.   At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs.  They  might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've  finally  come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little  technologies, all of  which I'll explore in a future blog post.

**Conclusion**

I’ll   leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these   deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is   far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel   will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet   another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD,   outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs?   Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible   margins from their monopolistic position?

Xeris Pharmaceuticals (XERS, see [https://www.xerispharma.com](https://www.xerispharma.com/)) looks completely overlooked and undervalued. They've recently created a breakthrough product (Gvoke HypoPen) that is now believed to be the best emergency treatment for severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar – see [https://www.healthline.com/health/hypoglycemia](https://www.healthline.com/health/hypoglycemia)).

The Gvoke HypoPen (see [https://www.gvokeglucagon.com](https://www.gvokeglucagon.com/)) is similar to an EpiPen (it treats hypoglycemia in an emergency situation). There is a huge market for this due to the growing number of people diagnosed with diabetes. According to an older CBS article ""371 million people had diabetes globally in 2012… By 2030, they expect 552 million people will have the disease."" (see [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/371-million-people-have-diabetes-globally-about-half-undiagnosed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/371-million-people-have-diabetes-globally-about-half-undiagnosed)).

It is apparent that hospitals, schools, and regular businesses will be phasing out their Glucagon medical kits for the new Gvokes. Furthermore, there are millions of individual diabetics that will want to have these accessible in case of emergency. Gvoke is currently covered by about 80% of insurance companies in the US with $0 copay. Moreover, Gvoke is close to approval in EU. The company’s debt is very reasonable and they have plenty of cash on hand. Xeris actually has trouble producing enough Gvokes to meet all the recent demand.

**Catalysts**

There seems to be a perfect storm of factors that could propel the XERS stock and options into the stratosphere:   
 

• Recently launched (July 1st) game-changing product (Gvoke HypoPen, see [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xeris-pharmaceuticals-announces-gvoke-hypopen-110000083.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xeris-pharmaceuticals-announces-gvoke-hypopen-110000083.html))

• Earnings report &amp; conference call - Mon 08/10/20 – Today! Due to new sales of Gvoke HypoPen, the next ER is likely to show solid numbers (see [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xeris-pharmaceuticals-announce-second-quarter-200500496.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xeris-pharmaceuticals-announce-second-quarter-200500496.html))

• Active Stock/Low float The stock has been very active and liquid recently with over 2M shares traded daily (with a tight spread of $0.01 most of the time). XERS has a pretty low float of about 27M shares with 58% held long-term by institutions.

• Reduced stock price (about $3.30 and rising at the time of writing) The XERS price has recently dropped due to overreaction to a public offering. It presents a great opportunity to purchase at the right price

• Short squeeze Recently increased short borrow rate across various brokers (see [https://twitter.com/dteb16/status/1287783290347368449](https://twitter.com/dteb16/status/1287783290347368449), as an example) makes shorting XERS much harder. Between that, the upcoming ER + other good news, we are likely to see a major short squeeze in the next few weeks

• George Soros – recently disclosed a 5.3% stake (about 2.5M shares) in the company (see [https://www.smarteranalyst.com/yahoo/xeris-spikes-12-after-hours-on-soros-stake-analyst-says-buy/amp](https://www.smarteranalyst.com/yahoo/xeris-spikes-12-after-hours-on-soros-stake-analyst-says-buy/amp)). It’s a great sign when such prominent investors purchase a large block of stock in line with 58% of total institutional ownership

• Medium 12-month XERS price target (based on 4 analysts) is $12.50, with a high forecast of $15.00 (see [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xers/price-target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xers/price-target), [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-beaten-penny-stocks-look-193735305.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-beaten-penny-stocks-look-193735305.html)).

• A $4.1M contract (see [https://beta.sam.gov/opp/acb59c12ce004ebf832c456d8c10d283/view](https://beta.sam.gov/opp/acb59c12ce004ebf832c456d8c10d283/view)) was awarded to Xeris on July 1st by the Department of Veteran Affairs, which is for some reason still unannounced

• Many other products at different developmental stages in the company’s pipeline (several versions of Glucagon, Diazepam, Pramlintide-Insulin, etc.) – see [https://www.xerispharma.com/research-development/pipeline](https://www.xerispharma.com/research-development/pipeline)

**Risk/Reward**

It seems to me that the reward far outweighs the risk in this case. There’s an overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to the significant upside (see Catalysts).

**Conclusion**

There is already a major buzz around the stock and the price is starting to reflect it. With everything that’s happening, my conservative target for XERS stock is $15-$17 within the next few months (would make options earn a very nice multiple). Everything feels like XERS is getting ready to explode.

**TLDR:**

I am currently buying/accumulating XERS stock and options - 09/18/20 $5c, 10/16/20 $5c &amp; 01/15/21 $5c. This looks like a great ground-floor opportunity to me. If you agree – join me before all other investors pile in and price explodes. These are my own opinions, I'm not a financial advisor.

Hope ya'll are well! I'm a 20y.o. college student studying Accounting and Finance. I have $700 (currency in USD) to burn and would really like to use this money to kick start trading. I'm from Australia and will be using Stake to trade in the US markets.

I've been eyeing high dividend ETFs such as $SPHD, $SCHD and $SPYD as well as growth ETFs such as $VUG and $MGK. Being a young man like myself, I have a high risk tolerance and would like to start passive investing in ETF funds with a long term outlook (8years); with hopes of taking what I sow to use as a down payment for my first house.

 I'm currently out of work due to the pandemic and would probably stay jobless till July next year. Once I get back on my feet, I'll put approx. $25 each week into trading. 

Would like to hear some ETF suggestions for my situation now (elaborations are appreciated). 

Should I dollar cost average in my case? 

Also, which is more worthwhile; buying many cheap stocks OR buying a few expensive stocks.

Friday was a choppy day but the markets ended the day and the week higher. Safe havens from gold to bitcoin are continuing to surge higher as the dollar is showing some weakness.

In Washington, President Trump signed executive orders to extend unemployment benefits and start a payroll tax holiday. According to the constitution, the President does not have the power to do this. The President, in an apparent bribe to voters, promised to make the tax cuts forgivable if he was reelected.

Congress has given up some constitutional powers in recent decades without any real fight. I doubt they will give up the powers of the purse.

The unemployment benefits require the states to pick up part of the bill. Cash the states just don't have.

I think stocks, gold, and bitcoin are going to continue climbing as investors more assets out of the US Dollar.

I started buying and selling stocks 3-4 months ago and I have been largely successful. Here are some tips

1. Read a lot about what you see in Reddit because they will give you some good ideas. just before I bought fastly 2 months ago, I was reading a lot of posts on Reddit leading me to purchase fastly. I bought it at 70$ and sold it at 90$ making easy money.
2. Remember to always sell on a peak. buy when it peaks down and just wait for the stock to rise. You can try to gamble and see if it rises really high, but I usually sell when I see it lowering too much
3. look to buy companies before earnings report. Make sure the company is good and profitable and if you know it will do good on its quarterly earnings report then buy it a few days just before the report at a cheap price. I gained 15% on Square and Disney by doing this.
4. Make sure to watch the news. Trump just signed a bill that will most likely boost the stock market tomorrow. It would be a good idea to buy a lot of quality stocks tomorrow morning and sell them at a higher price later throughout the week.

I'll probably make more posts about day trading but for now just know this and you should be good in the stock market and you can also start making money consistently.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,494930,public,confidence,self,How I became a day trader making 1500 a month in just 4 months,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/i6vaxi/how_i_became_a_day_trader_making_1500_a_month_in/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1st and foremost I would like to acknowledge the fact that I am a trading noob only trading since June. I was recently laid off from work and put a couple grand in the market hoping to make some good profit. I pretty much got kinda lucky and bought 100 shares of Pinterest at $17 before earnings and was pleasantly surprised after earnings to watch it double in price for a nearly 100% gain. I bought some Microsoft and thats going to be my long-term hold, I'm going to continue to try and buy as I like where the company is headed. My current bet is on Nio and I have 100 shares in this company as well. I would like to write options on my positions in Nio and Pinterest since I own 100 shares of both but when I open the options chains, I go in thinking I get it after watching some videos/reading articles... And leave stumped and disappointed as I still feel like a lost puppy and am afraid to make the wrong move. So I guess the question is, since I already own 100 shares of the stock.. Let's take Nio...I am willing to sell me Nio after earnings at $17 considering the call goes well... Is that a call option? And if the earnings are not well then the option just expires right?

countries](https://www.brookings.edu/research/school-closures-government-responses-and-learning-inequality-around-the-world-during-covid-19/) have implemented school closures. For the United States specifically, every state and territory ordered or recommended school closures—affecting upwards of 55 million students across the country. Wary of the achievement gap that could spur from prolonged closures, the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) has recently released [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools-faq.html) for reopening schools. Moreover, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York [recently announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/nyregion/cuomo-schools-reopening.html) that schools can decide to open so long as they are in a region where the average rate of positive coronavirus tests is below 5 percent over a two-week period.\xa0\n\n**Efficacy of School Reopening: Lessons from Other Nations**\n\nExtended school closures impact students in a variety of ways: it fosters learning loss, weakens social and emotional skills, entrenches abuse in unstable homes, and can lead to a decline in nutritional health. Cognizant of the importance of in-person instruction, multiple countries have already set guidelines to reopen their schools:\n\n*Denmark*\n\n* In Denmark, students were to stay 2 meters apart wherever possible, were grouped into “bubbles” of 12, and were required to wash their hands every two hours but not to wear masks.\xa0\n\n*Germany*\n\n* In Germany, their government cut class sizes in half, had one-way hallways, staggered breaks, masks for teachers and free twice-weekly Covid-19 tests for students and teachers.\n\n*Taiwan*\n\n* In Taiwan, students returned to school and were required to go through temperature checks at school entries and to wear face masks. Additionally, Taiwan left school reopening to a more localized decision to account for differing infection rates in the country.\n\nIn each of these nations, case and mortality counts continued to decline after reopening schools—a positive indication that school reopenings have been effectively implemented with a variety of guidelines.\n\n**Concerns With School Reopening**\n\nAlthough some governments were able to successfully reopen schools, other governments were not as successful. In Jerusalem, over 100 students and 15 staff members were infected after an outbreak occurred at a high school. To alleviate the spread of COVID-19 in schools, the CDC recommends more research on mitigation strategies (i.e. face masks, the use of cohorting, social distancing).\n\nThe Council of Chief State School Officers estimated that schools would need between $158.1 billion and $244.6 billion in additional funding to open safely.\xa0\n\nOn top of the estimated [158.1 billion to 244.6 billion dollars](https://ccsso.org/blog/ccsso-submits-cost-estimate-safely-reopening-public-schools-after-covid) school are estimated to need to open safely, considering that the United States has recently surpassed five million virus cases, school reopenings could pose a harm to children—especially considering that the response to COVID-19 has not been as effective as other nations that have reopened schools.\n\n**Financial Impacts**\n\n*Stocks*\n\nOnline educational institutions and virtual schools have seen increases in enrollment as a result of extended school closures.

I am in debt and also have family responsibilities.

Experts are warning that the economic effect of 55 million Americans filing for jobless claims and other issue amid the coronavirus pandemic will make the country’s Social Security crisis even worse.

“The coronavirus lockdown and current engineered artificial depression has made the Social Security system to be impaired as early as 2032,” Peter Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, a non-profit academic think tank, told Yahoo Money. “Changes are going to have to be made, whether it’s lower benefits for recipients or different qualifications, such as a higher age to qualify.”

Today, workers pay 6.2% of their taxable earnings up to $137,700 into the system.

Perhaps someone could explain  something to a dumb beginner. I'm looking into an ETF that's listed on NYSE, LSE and XETRA among other markets. They all perform quite similar (as they should I think) since they are the same ETF and track the same index. 

My question however is that the performance is similar but there are still some differences in stock price when comparing the dates on different stock markets. For example the best performing seems to be the one on the LSE. 

Sorry for the dumb question, but why is it like that? Shouldn't the prices be relatively the same?

""sometimes you learn the most by closing your mouth and opening your ears"". Especially on this sub, I see a lot of people trying to be like somebody else. ex: ""yo I read about someone who got into TSLA at $200 and now they're 21 years old with $100,000. I'm gonna do the same and bet on NIO or some other up-and-comer"". I get it, we're all looking for short cuts, it's only human to be looking for the most efficient route. After all, one can argue the only reason we are trading stocks is for a short cut (personally, financially, etc) . I have a roughly $5,000 portfolio and half of that is in REITs and stable low yield dividend stocks. Sure, I have a couple ""risky"" positions - - but if you put all your eggs into one basket (whether it's a single stock or single market), you're bound to have some rough days. So having ~ $200 a year come from dividends helps me balance out some of those bad trades and for the future ones I may or may not make. Stop comparing yourself to other portfolios. You have no idea when they got in, what positions they have and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, how much they'll have tomorrow, next week, or a month from now.

Long story short: close your mouth, stop comparing your portfolio to others', and simply do YOU. Invest in what you know, diversify into stable stocks to negate from market volatility and keep your expectations LOW

I'm not a professional trader so let's get that out of the way first thing. I'm looking for help in risk management on LONG (&amp; long-term) positions, both investment category with very long time horizon (years / decades), and other long positions that are meant for several months or more, but may not be intended to be for many years / decades.  

Additional NOTE: this is for both taxable and Non-taxable accounts.  

Here are the options i've considered / used and was seeking your input on other ways to do this, and/or feedback on which approach to use and when:  

-DON'T TOUCH: leave the long positions open and do not react to market. do not use stops so you don't get punted out of your positions if there is a market correction. just stay put and DO NOT react. if the companies / equity vehicles survive - they will bounce back. do NOT time the market and you may add to these positions in a DCA / lump sum manner as time goes on. (taxable / non-taxable accounts equal application).    

- trailing STOP / trailing STOP market / trailing STOP limits: use to lock in profits and exit positions if there is a correction of some amount from peak, could be anywhere from 10-20% depending on the position. do NOT set up the trailing stop order UNTIL price reaches break even point (so enter the trailing stop order once the stock is 10-20% higher than initial purchase, or average cost-basis when DCA'ing &amp; adding to position) (this method BETTER in tax-free account. In taxable accounts this will create realized gains which will increase your liabilities in years where there are market corrections so this can add to the pain).  

-STOP loss orders combined with BUY STOP LIMIT orders: create a STOP loss order at some defined point in the green or at worst, break even point, and adjust manually as stock moves up - but WITH enough distance to not trigger with normal market / equity fluctuation. The STOP LOSS ORDER triggers a BUY STOP LIMIT order to repurchase the equities when they go back up near the original starting price or previous price that was in the green, to be placed after reversal to established upward trend (in an tax-free account like an IRA without margin, this will be affected by settlement times - so it would be ideal to delay the repurch orders by at ~3days to avoid GFV's).  

-STOP loss orders combined with BUY STOP LIMIT orders, as above BUT with repurchase of the equities at a LOWER price once an upward trend is re-established. This order is an OCO and replaces the BUY STOP LIMIT. So capital freed from original position is used to acquire more shares. This is like above but combined with timing the market and taking advantage of lower price - so it's not the same thing as 'averaging down' as many inexperienced / amateur traders do. (This strategy also creates taxable events if it's in a taxable account, and in a non-margin account the settlement times also need to be taken into account here).  

I'd love feedback on the prior examples, and any other risk management methods professional traders use on long term / investment type positions.

The app suffered a systemwide, all-day outage. The company claimed it was due to an ""unprecedented load"" on the infrastructure due to volatile market conditions. But then it happened and again. The app crashed three times in one week. A week, mind you, that had multiple days with significant trading. 

Users took to social media to blast the company. A Twitter account called ""Robinhood Class Action"" had more than 7000 followers in just days. Some even took legal action against Robinhood, which is ironic. You know, the hero being sued? Anyways. 

But let's not forget about the fine print. Robinhood's customer agreement states that it will not be responsible for ""temporary interruptions in service due to maintenance, Website or App changes, or failures"" beyond its control. 

Always, always read the fine print.

# **Markets could be challenged by Washington stimulus talks and China tensions  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/markets-could-be-challenged-by-washington-stimulus-talks-and-china-tensions.html)**
*****
&gt; The debate in Washington over the next round of fiscal stimulus and rising tensions between the White House and China could act as brakes on the stock market in the coming week.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week but were more sluggish Friday, as investors watched stimulus talks between Democrats and the Trump administration stall out. Investors also were concerned that President Donald Trump’s executive order banning U.S. transactions with Tencent’s We Chat and Bytedance’s Tik Tok would accelerate the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China and draw retribution.
*****
&gt; Just ahead of Friday’s market close, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just that he is recommending the White House move forward with executive orders on unemployment, student loans and rental foreclosures. He said a compromise could not be reached with Democrats, who wanted a $2 trillion package. Stocks edged higher after the announcement though details of the orders and how any assistance could be funded were unclear.
*****
&gt; “It’s an attempt to bring the Democrats back to the table to negotiate a deal by threatening to use an executive order. They may be able to get some things down, but it won’t be enough to create the bridge they need while the economy continues to repair itself,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.4% for the week, ending at 3,351, after a 2 point gain Friday. The Nasdaq was down 0.9% Friday, ending at 11,010. It was up 2.5% for the week.
*****
&gt; “Part of the reason stocks have held in there well and continue to melt up is that one of the things that is priced in is a fifth fiscal policy package of $1.5 trillion. if we don’t get one, I do think the market will retrace lower to reflect a lack of stimulus,” said Arone. “The recovery will stall out without one.”
*****
&gt; As for China, it has so far not taken actions against U.S. companies, even with the Trump administration’s moves to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from using U.S. parts. The latest steps, however, raised concerns that China could find ways to retaliate, and that the U.S. will bar Chinese IPOs.
*****
&gt; “On balance, continued hostility toward China is going to be a continued net negative for U.S. companies that are revenue exposed to China,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. “We know the exposure is very centered in the Nasdaq names.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the stock market is entering a seasonally weak time, and while market psychology is still strong it could start to change. “The seasonals are starting to shift negatively. We all know September is a poor month and the degree of the escalation of the tensions between the U.S. in China is not a surprise, but the degree of the escalation over the last 48 hours is,” he said. “It’s not changing psychology, but it’s challenging bullish psychology.”
*****
&gt; In the coming week, there are some final earnings of the season, including technology company Cisco and food company Sysco. Some travel companies including Royal Caribbean report, as does consumer goods company Tapestry. In the week after, big retailers roll out their reports in the final earnings burst of the quarter.
*****
&gt; Economic reports could be important in the coming week, as investors watch consumer price index inflation data Wednesday and retail sales Friday. Retail sales should provide a window into the consumer, as workers returned to their jobs but also faced uncertainty because of reclosings.
*****
&gt; CPI is important as the market has been assuming inflation will ultimately start to show gains because of the weakening dollar and ballooning budget deficits. CPI last month showed a 0.6% increase month over month.
*****
&gt; The pro-inflation trade has become important and has driven investors into stocks, gold, and out of the dollar.
*****
&gt; # Watch this trade
The dollar could be the key to the fate of markets in the coming week. The U.S. currency was edging higher Friday but is still down about 3.5% over the past four weeks. Gold declined Friday, and Treasury yields moved lower.
*****
&gt; “The dollar ... to me it just continues to be an important barometer that has a unique intersection of rates, inflation and risk assets,” said Arone. “With rising China, U.S. tensions and combined with the fact that there’s uncertainty about the fiscal policy package and the fact the dollar has declined so quickly, many are expecting it to catch a bid here and rebound.”
*****
&gt; Part of the move in the dollar was based on the idea that huge government spending would increase the government’s deficit and Treasury issuance. Emanuel said the news on stimulus could have a big impact on the trade.
*****
&gt; “We would make the argument the baseline expectation was a trillion dollars worth of stimulus to be implemented sometime in the month of August. Anything below that expectation is likely to cause the dollar to strengthen,” said Emanuel. “It’s a momentum and positioning trade as well as what has been ... the unwind of an asset diversification trade.”
*****
&gt; The stalling of talks could shift the market’s view that the U.S. is willing to spend any amount to fight the impact of the coronavirus. “It’s changing the market psychology that the government’s propensity to spend infinitely is not as great as it was earlier in the week,,” Emanuel said. “The dollar rallying, from our perspective, is a direct threat to a lot of these momentum trades.”
*****
&gt; Strategists said a strengthening dollar could be a headwind for stocks.
*****
&gt; “Given the friction with China, to the extent the inflation numbers come in weaker than expected, the argument being that whole weaker dollar asset diversification has helped feed into increasing inflation expectations,” said Emanuel. “If the inflation data does surprise to the downside, given the rally in inflation ...it’s further potential for the unwinding of the short dollar trade and the unwinding of the long gold trade which in our view bleeds over into stocks.”

&gt; # Individual Investors Still Don't Believe

&gt; As mentioned in a prior post, in the past week the S&amp;P 500 has moved within 2% of its 2/19 high, but at the same time, less than a quarter of AAII respondents are optimistic for the future of stocks over the next six months. That begs the question- if there have been past times that sentiment and price action have been so detached from one another. Since the start of the AAII survey in 1987, there have been 10 periods (including the current one) in which the S&amp;P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high but bullish sentiment was less than 25% without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent prior occurrence was not even a full year ago. Back in October, sentiment was only slightly higher as the S&amp;P 500 was 1.84% from its all-time high. Prior to that, there were some scattered instances throughout 2013, 2015, and 2016 but before that, you would have to go back to 1993 to find another similar period. The one occurrence in 2013 stands out as it was both the lowest sentiment reading of these prior occurrences and the only one that occurred with the S&amp;P 500 right at an all-time high.

&gt; As for where things stand after such instances, sentiment has tended to reverse higher in the following six months as the S&amp;P 500 has tended to move higher. The S&amp;P 500 has actually tended towards better than average returns over the next three months, although performance six months out has been modestly worse than average, even as it has been higher more often than not. Additionally, as shown in the second chart below, of the more recent occurrences of the past decade, they haven't marked any major top or bottom for the S&amp;P 500 with occurrences clustered both coming off of lows and in the middle of longer-term uptrends.

&gt; # Silver Takes the Gold

&gt; Gold and silver prices were already on a tear heading into this week, but they've only seen their gains accelerate even more. With more than a day and a half of trading left in the week, front-month gold futures have rallied, but silver has been the real show stopper with a gain of 16%!

&gt; Taking a look at a one-year chart of silver over the last year, things have really gone parabolic this week as the front-month futures contract is trading more than 40% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and 62% above its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Silver.png))**

&gt; Were it not for the move in silver, gold's move would be getting all the attention. Prices for gold have also seen a major surge in the last month, rising from under $1,800 to the current level of $2,060 per ounce. While not as extended as silver, gold currently trades 14% above its 50-DMA and 26% above its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold.png))**

&gt; With gold 25.7% above its 200-DMA and silver 62.2% above, the average spread of the two commodities currently stands at 44.3%. In the 40+ year history of the two futures contracts, there have only been a handful of prior periods where the average spread of the two commodities was larger or even above 35% for that matter with the most recent occurring back in early 2011. This recent rally in the two commodities has certainly been one for the ages.

&gt; # Big Moves Off 52-Week Lows

&gt; Within the US equity market, we've seen some major moves in individual stocks off their 52-week lows over the last few months. Look at the table below. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, stocks in the index are up an average of 87.6% from their respective 52-week lows. Looking at performance by individual sectors, stocks in the Energy sector are up an average of 136.8%, while the average Consumer Discretionary stock has rallied 131.4%. The Technology sector wasn't hit nearly as hard by the Covid-crash as other sectors, but stocks in the sector have doubled on an average basis relative to their 52-week lows. The only sector where stocks are up less than 50% on an average basis from their 52-week lows is Utilities at 46.33%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low.png))**

&gt; For many investors, the holy grail of stock picking is the proverbial ten-bagger. A ten-bagger is a stock that multiplies by ten times its original price. Usually, this happens over the span of years, but in the Covid-economy, we've actually seen a number of these ten-baggers play out in the span of months. While most of these examples are in the small-cap space, shares of Wayfair (W), which has a current market cap of $27.5 billion, have rallied from $21.70 on March 19th to its current price of $290.85 now. That's a gain of more than 1,200% in less than five months!

&gt; Within the entire Russell 1,000, 257 stocks have at least doubled off their 52-week lows, and in the table below we highlight the 34 stocks that are at least a quarter of the way to the ten-bagger club and have rallied more than 250%. As mentioned above, W tops the list, but Fastly (FSLY), which has barely been public for a year, is just shy of the club with a gain of 992%. Behind FSLY, Livongo Health (LVGO) is up 855%. Given that LVGO just got a takeover offer from Teladoc (TDOC), the 11th best-performing stock on the list, it may only make the ten-bagger club under the banner of the TDOC ticker.

&gt; In looking through the list of stocks shown, many of these names come from the Health Care, Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors and have been direct beneficiaries of the new Covid-economy. At the same time, six stocks from the Energy sector made the list as well as they recovered from their bombed-out levels after oil prices briefly traded in negative territory earlier this year.

&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far

&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.

&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**

&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.

&gt; # Labor Market Continues Summer Momentum

&gt; After falling the most on record in April, the US labor market has rebounded with three consecutive months of job gains, adding back more than 9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. In July, the economy added back nearly 1.8 million jobs, ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimates for 1.5 million and lowering the unemployment rate from 11.1% to 10.2%, but lingering measurement issues could add 1% to that number, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, job gains were broad based across industries, with a third of the increase coming from the leisure and hospitality sector—the “scene of the accident” industries—while only information, and mining and logging posted declines in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “March and April were historically brutal months for the labor market, but the labor market’s resiliency this summer has been a welcome development,” stated LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “However, the next few months will be critical for the economy as schools reopen and additional fiscal stimulus still hangs in the balance.”

&gt; The July report also comes on the heels of a rise in COVID-19 cases across the Sunbelt region of the United States. Because of the date of the survey, it may not fully reflect the economic impact of some of the more recent high-frequency data that has captured some of the effect of rising cases. Still, the jobs report shows that the US economy is continuing to heal despite the long road ahead.

&gt; # Are Recessions Good For Stocks?

&gt; This isn’t like any recession we’ve ever seen, as it was sparked by a horrible pandemic and happened because people were told to stay inside. The impact was the worst contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter that anyone who is reading this has ever seen. But what is quite surprising is the fact the Nasdaq has made 30 all-time highs so far in 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained four consecutive months, all while the unemployment rate remains above 10%.

&gt; Why is this happening? There are two main schools of thought. One is that stocks are forecasting a better economy later this year and into 2021; remember, stocks tend to lead the economy and could be doing so once again. Another school of thought is that the massive fiscal and monetary policy are boosting equity prices, while not helping the overall economy quite as much.

&gt; Here’s the catch. It actually isn’t abnormal to see stocks gain during a recession. “This is one that might surprise many people, but stocks have actually gained during 7 of the past 12 recessions,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There’s no question the difference between what is happening on Wall Street compared with Main Street is about as wide as we’ve ever seen, but maybe it shouldn’t be as big of a surprise that stocks have been strong.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 actually gained 1.3% on average when looking at the 12 previous recessions going back to World War II, with a very impressive median advance of 5.7% (the average is skewed lower due to 2008). We continue to expect this recession to end soon, if it isn’t over already. In fact, when the end of the recession is officially declared at a later date, we could have yet another recession that saw stock market gains.

Impact Biomedical is a 100% owned subsidiary of Singapore eDevelopment Limited (SeD), which was recently [valued at 1.39 Billion](https://www.acnnewswire.com/press-release/english/59352/impact-biomedical-and-grdg-sciences-announce-medical-technology-package-valued-at-usd-1.39-billion-\(sgd-1.97-billion\)-by-independent-experts). SeD announced it has obtained shareholders’ approval on June 26, 2020 for the proposed Transaction. The completion of the proposed Transaction is now conditional only upon the approval of the shareholders of DSS, which is [scheduled to convene on August 10, 2020 to vote on the acquisition.](http://irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/4385655) The proposed bonus being, for every one DSS share held, the shareholder will be entitled to a bonus of two IMPACT shares. Following that, IMPACT is to pursue an initial public offering.


**Why is This Acquisition an investment opportunity?**

Impact biomedical has multiple technologies and intellectual
properties that have received global recognition, including: 3F Biofragrance, Equivir, &amp; Linebacker. 

On June 25th,[ Impact Biomedical announced proven in vitro success with Equivir and 3F Biofragrance against COVID-19](https://www.pharmavoice.com/newsreleases/impact-biomedical-achieves-covid-19-success-equivir-3f-biofragrance/).  Equivir proved successful as a treatment, as well as a prophylactic protecting the cells from infection by the virus. 3F Biofragrance proved successful as a surface disinfectant, killing the virus in concentrations as low as 1/5000 after 15 seconds. Equivir and Linebacker also caused transformational change in the host ACE-2 receptor, interfering with the virus’ ability to interact and infect the host cell. The binding affinity of components of 3F Biofragrance were also observed during molecular docking. 

The research is [part of a program conducted by GRDG to adhere to the principles and initiatives established by Project Bioshield and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority \(BARDA\) directives from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \(HHS\)](https://www.genengnews.com/news/two-promising-sars-cov-2-blocking-compounds-undergo-testing/). GRDG is advised by Lieutenant Colonel William H. Lyerly Jr., retired U.S. Army Medical Service Corps Officer, and retired Career Senior Executive / Scientific Professional at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Lieutenant Colonel Lyerly also served as senior official in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and U.S. Executive Office of the President (White House). Lieutenant Colonel Lyerly states, [“the importance of technologies such as Linebacker and Equivir cannot be understated as the global spread of the virus continues to accelerate”](https://www.newshubasia.com/post/affect-biomedicals-linebacker-and-equivir-repress-sars-cov-2-infection-mindful-for-the-covid-19-flare-up/).

Still a relatively new investor , will keep this one short and sweet. 

question is: If i’m planning my morning now, and i’m setting buy orders (limit) do i factor in after hours close price or the regular close? 

Example with numbers , stock is $8.35 at close, but $8.70 after hours, do i set my trigger price at say $8.37 and limit at $8.45 or $8.73 and $8.80 to take advantage of early morning buy as close to the second that tickets start. Earnings is tomorrow and i want to take advantage right before it jumps.

1. When a stock bought at $100, drops to $50, i have three options, to buy more, hold and sell. If i hold, and it drops to 0, does my shares disappear?   


  


a. If i sell when it drop to $50, that negative 50 is known as capital loss, do i owe money?  


  


b. If i hold on to the stock forever, i will never need to report the capital loss?  


  


  
2. How does capital loss affect my taxes? i believe that there is a safety net up to $3000? Meaning i can get a capital loss of 3k a year and face no penalty? what happens if i go over 3k? Does it affect my income?

Wanted to buy into the market but have been thinking why go in now when there is a possibility of things deteriorating in the coming months due to COVID cases, unemployment, politics,  less demand etc.

It could go 2 ways

**-If I buy in NOW :** 

1.) Market Crashes: My money stagnates for a couple of years until I break even or at worst some companies don’t make it thru and lose some money. 

2.) The market goes up: I got in at a discount and catch the tech rallies.

**- If I buy in LATER: ( when the clouds have settled and things are more clear for the economy)** 

1.) Market Crashes: I avoided buying high and got a good deal. 

2.) The market goes up: I missed a good buy-in opportunity and these crazy tech rallies going on at the moment.

My thoughts are that it seems too late to buy in any way when things look like they are at ATH. So worst-case scenario The way I see it is I would rather miss out on a quick buck I would make if I got in now because the cons and risk outweigh the positives if the market crashes and my money gets held up for god knows how long until the market recovers. 

So I would rather wait then lose on a discount buy, and then get in when things are calmer. 

Or buying half now and half later?

Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Some gems from this: 

&gt; “There is little evidence of thought as to whether the price of a security already reflects current and projected future news flow, or whether the opening up of the economy might be premature, a sign not of strength, but of impatience, lack of resolve, and poor judgment,” Klarman said.

&gt; Since 1982, Klarman has been one of the most consistent investors in the market, delivering gains in 31 of his fund’s first 34 years.

&gt; Fed To Blame: Klarman is known for his long-term, value-oriented investment style. Because he rarely comments publicly or grants interviews, followers must piece together his philosophy based on tidbits of insight he has provided throughout the years.

&gt; Klarman was also highly critical of the Federal Reserve in his letter, accusing the Fed of enabling irrational investors.

&gt; “Investors are being infantilized by the relentless Federal Reserve activity. It’s as if the Fed considers them foolish children, unable to rationally set the prices of securities so it must intervene,” he wrote.

I tend to agree, but doesn't mean we can't keep pumping higher.

So earlier this year I set up a 212 invest account and now have 8k in it, and it's doing quite well (fluctuating from 0 - 20% up) as I managed to buy quite low during COVID.

However, I didn't realise the ISA option makes MUCH more sense, with not getting taxed, etc. 

I contacted them asking if I could move my investments into my ISA but that's not allowed. I could sell and move funds over and buy back shares, but i'm quite hesistant to do that as they're doing so well and a fair few of them are still down so I'm waiting for them to recover.

What would you do? I was thinking of just leaving what I have in there and making all future investments in the ISA, then eventually selling and moving INVEST into ISA just before I surpass the capital gains tax free allowance.

Does this seem sensible? I have literally no idea what is best.

TLDR; fucked up putting stocks in invest instead of ISA, what now?",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,491827,public,confidence,self,212: I chose invest instead of ISA and not sure what to do next (UK),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/i4nvvk/212_i_chose_invest_instead_of_isa_and_not_sure/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First off, thanks to everyone for being so helpful in the past. I’m 32 and really getting into investing.

So, I have a retirement date fund  through Mutual of America via my 401b3. Employer matches a little. I have been maxing it out for 3 years so far. Looking back, it hasn’t done very well. I looked at some reviews for it and I don’t believe analysts are too hot on it.

I also have a brokerage account through TDAMERITRADE. I own ETFs (VOO, IAU, VEU, BND) and a few blue chip stocks. 

Is it dumb to have both? Am I just eating too many fees? My original thought process was to have my target fund be my retirement and my brokerage to cash out in 10 years for maybe a vacation and fun money. 

The fee for mutual fund is .75% where as the ETFs are minuscule. I’m not good at math so I’m wondering if having both is a waste?

I’m not going to be talking about diversifying away from tech and into commodities, fuck that. There is a time when commodities will be a good play, times when energy sector is booming, and a time when the financial sector will be rotated back in.\n\nBefore I get started, I want to remind you guys that YOLO-ing is fine, but it should be at your “maximum risk tolerance” per play. Any time you YOLO you should expect that play to go to $0. Anything better than 0% return you consider it as a win. The idea of making 200% and turning $10k to $30k sounds so enticing to many new traders/investors. I mean that sounds FKn amazing to me too, but with that mentality you will VERY quickly go from wanting to turn $10k into $50k, to trying to get your $6k back to the break-even, to eventually (and most likely inevitably) saying “Man I wish I still had $10k in my account to do small trades and caterpillar my way back up.” We’ve all been there, we’ve all had sweet wins, and anxiety-inducing losses. It’s cliche, but if you can learn from those losses you will truly improve over time. The best way to grow your account is to inch it up, even 1% per week would be beating most funds.\n\nEveryone has a different trading strategy that will be fine-tuned to their own needs. Bottom line is if you are making plays that require you to watch your phone and see every tick the stock moves up or down, then your position sizing is too big. If you are sweating every time the stock drops 1%, then your position sizing needs adjustment. You should be able to trade/invest comfortably without needing to check the market 25 times per day. If futures opening red gives you anxiety then your position sizing needs to get in check.\n\nNow this is where I talk about diversification. If you only like investing in tech stocks, then got damn who am I to tell you not to? But diversify your portfolio and slowly build positions. Just because you want to YOLO AAPL calls doesn’t mean you also can’t invest in FB, AMZN, MSFT all at the same time. You are all free to do as you please, but what I mean by building your position is to slowly enter each trade with solid entry points that will give you confidence in holding your position for 6 months if you have to.\n\nI used to YOLO and do all that too… When you put 50% of your account into one play that expires in two weeks you are setting yourself up for some anxiety attacks if the position goes against you. I enjoy watching the market just as much as anyone else and can do it all day, but you should have the ability to not check the market every hour if you don’t need to. The performance of the stock market (which is next thing closest to being random) should not have the ability to fuck up your account, mental state, or your relationships with family and friends. Losses are tough regardless of the situation, but I guarantee losses are much more difficult to deal with when deep down you know what you were doing was slightly crazy.\n\nGoing back to “diversifying”. Typically I do 60% shares in my account, about 20% theta gang selling spreads, and the other 20% I am either buying calls (2-6 months out) or selling a call AGAINST my share position (as a hedge). If you stick to your game-plan or a set of rules you must obey, which can be something as simple as “only buying stocks when it’s down 1% or more”, you can really start to build strong positions. When you have strong positions and have managed a good amount of entry points for them, then the reward is greater than the risk. Compound this with 6-10 stocks and you will find yourself panic selling much less frequently. If you are heavily invested in 2 stocks and they don’t go your way of course you will panic sell. If you have 6-10 strong positions and 1 goes down, but the other 5 are up, you will have the confidence to hold that losing position until it is eventually profitable or at least back to break-even. How many times have you panic-sold on a red day only for the stock go be big green on the next? How many times did you re-buy on that green day and restart that very same cycle over?\n\nWith trading options you really must know how each Greek is going to affect your price in the short-term. Im sure most of you know about options greek’s and such. Sometimes the right play is not to buy a call, but to sell a spread, collect on the stock going up AND collect on IV potentially going down. Here are two examples of plays for AAPL, current stock price $438.66 at the time I am writing this and looking at the option chain (Tuesday night):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Buying the $460 strike September 18 call costs $12.75. At that price, AAPL needs to continue climbing and be over $472.75 at expiration just to get your money back and break-even. I understand you would most likely sell the option if AAPL ran up a couple days in a row, which is reasonable to expect. For this example, lets say AAPL shoots up $480 in a week. Your $12.75 option contract would most likely be worth double. Let’s even say triple for the sake of this example… But remember, anything less than AAPL shooting up right after you buy it will eat into your profits. You would probably say AAPL had an amazing run in one week to get to $480, no? So we can assume anything less than an “amazing run” would have you barely break even. After melting up so much after earnings it wouldn’t be unheard of if the stock just consolidated at $450 for a bit too, no?\n2. A second play to consider is this. Sell a vertical PUT spread first strike OTM 3 weeks away expiration. In this case, we are going to sell the $435/430 PUT spread. Cost for opening 5 credit spreads would net you $1,250 in premium (Max Reward) and have a Max Loss of ($1,300). This is the SAME max loss as purchasing the CALL option from example 1. We are limiting our gains with a spread, but in the previous example we NEEDED the stock to absolutely rocket up in order to make 100% gains. In this example, all we need AAPL to do is stay above $435 in 3 weeks time to collect max premium. Since stonks *mostly* only go up (\\* not financial advice), it’s less risky play for a similar reward.\n\nFrom the above example, option 1 you need AAPL to rocket up to earn your $1275, option 2 you only need AAPL to not go down to receive the same reward. This is why I mix shares/covered calls, spreads, and YOLOs. Different reasons to execute each. Find a trading strategy that works for your style and sanity and create a set of rules. When do you buy? When do you exit at a loss? When do you roll out? When do you take some off the table/profit? Do you play earnings? How long do you intend on holding the position? When do you average down, if at all? You should know all these things before entering any trade. 100% gains on YOLOs are nice, but inching your account up 2-3% per week or even month is actually the greatest gift you can give yourself.\n\nThere are definitely different risks to selling spreads such as being assigned the shares and dividend risk, so do your research on that before getting into spreads. Those two things are very easily avoided if you know what you are doing. Know when earnings calls are, know when ex-dividend dates are, keep an eye on your spreads for the short leg going in the money. Personally, my rule of thumb is if the stock has a dividend coming up, roll out the strike prices to further OTM to always keep the short leg out of the money. If there is no dividend and my spread is already ITM, I will hold my position and see if I can get a bounce/reversal to get it out.\n\n**Why sell at-the-money spread and not go further out?**\n\nA lot of people prefer to sell spreads a bit further out the money, it really depends on preference. In my opinion, selling PUT spreads on fundamentally strong stocks (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN) who don’t stay red very long are good candidates for this strategy. Going further OTM is increasing the max loss if the position does go against you. Another popular play would be to run the wheel by selling PUTs on a stock, getting assigned the shares (at a good price that you would normally purchase at), and then selling calls against the stock until the shares get called away. This strategy requires more margin or a larger account size, but can be profitable. If you run the WHEEL, in my opinion, it is always wise to not actually sell naked puts, but to sell a spread with the long leg very far OTM at the cheapest price, which will cover you in a black swan event such as what happened to Hertz going bankrupt. There was a company/hedge fund called “Option Sellers” that would sell naked call options on a relatively stable commodity, natural gas. One day natural gas m00ned and completely bankrupted his $200m fund. His investors actually owed more money than they invested. Again, his strategy was not very risky until all of a sudden it was. SELLING NAKED OPTIONS CAN BANKRUPT YOU. You can protect yourself for a small percentage of your gains by opening a spread, so do it.\n\n[Blog Post Source](https://swaggystocks.com/blog/2020/08/05/yolos-are-sweet-and-all-but-diversification-and-position-sizing-can-be-a-more-profitable-and-consistent-way-to-trade/)\n\nHere is a great Reddit post explaining the wheel method.\n\n[Intro to the wheel strategy for beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hfc4ce/intro_to_the_wheel_strategy_for_beginners/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=embed&amp;utm_content=body&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_name=b4cb670d9c0a47bf9bc26ee99de39e96&amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;utm_term=hfc4ce)', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard it all before… blah blah blah… diversification. I’m not going to be talking about diversifying away from tech and into commodities, fuck that. There is a time when commodities will be a good play, times when energy sector is booming, and a time when the financial sector will be rotated back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I get started, I want to remind you guys that YOLO-ing is fine, but it should be at your “maximum risk tolerance” per play. Any time you YOLO you should expect that play to go to $0. Anything better than 0% return you consider it as a win. The idea of making 200% and turning $10k to $30k sounds so enticing to many new traders/investors. I mean that sounds FKn amazing to me too, but with that mentality you will VERY quickly go from wanting to turn $10k into $50k, to trying to get your $6k back to the break-even, to eventually (and most likely inevitably) saying “Man I wish I still had $10k in my account to do small trades and caterpillar my way back up.” We’ve all been there, we’ve all had sweet wins, and anxiety-inducing losses. It’s cliche, but if you can learn from those losses you will truly improve over time. The best way to grow your account is to inch it up, even 1% per week would be beating most funds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a different trading strategy that will be fine-tuned to their own needs. Bottom line is if you are making plays that require you to watch your phone and see every tick the stock moves up or down, then your position sizing is too big. If you are sweating every time the stock drops 1%, then your position sizing needs adjustment. You should be able to trade/invest comfortably without needing to check the market 25 times per day. If futures opening red gives you anxiety then your position sizing needs to get in check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is where I talk about diversification. If you only like investing in tech stocks, then got damn who am I to tell you not to? But diversify your portfolio and slowly build positions. Just because you want to YOLO AAPL calls doesn’t mean you also can’t invest in FB, AMZN, MSFT all at the same time. You are all free to do as you please, but what I mean by building your position is to slowly enter each trade with solid entry points that will give you confidence in holding your position for 6 months if you have to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to YOLO and do all that too… When you put 50% of your account into one play that expires in two weeks you are setting yourself up for some anxiety attacks if the position goes against you.

Look at gold, silver, stocks- everything is going up even in a terrible economy due to the money creation.  Congress cant spend money fast enough. Inflation will come, and the Fed wont quit until It does. 

I am wondering what this will do to stocks in the intermediate term.  Initially everything goes up as the value of each dollar goes down.  But if inflation really gets going, would this cause a negative response?

Just curious as to how you think it will play out.   FYI- Goldman and others are starting to question whether the US can retain its status as the reserve currency.

While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. 

There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. 

Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. 

For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny.

**TLDR**: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price.

I will focus on the US but I believe these same effects are likely in every country because these patterns are universal.  

The background to the question is - that I have noticed that a lot of people who have money are republicans.  Obviously, a lot of democrats have money too - but let's call a spade a spade.  ""Conservatives"" are by definition opposed to change and tend to represent the status quo - which in general across time means those with the money.  I don't think this is controversial.  In general, the republican party is more pro-big-business.  

Let's cut to the chase.  I have noticed that most of the people I know that trade stocks actively, are republican and voted for trump.  Not all of them, but the majority.  Most of the democrats I know who have money let someone else manage it.  Again, I fully admit that this is just one person's perception and may be completely wrong and simply anecdotal.  That is why I am making the thread.  

The question is - does the stock market have a conservative bias?  If two people of opposite viewpoints look at where we are today, and one says ""schools will open in the fall, and everything will be back to normal by the end of the year"", and the other says ""schools will open in the fall, and everything will be a complete disaster"".... does the conservative viewpoint run the stocks up ?  

Again, not looking to open a debate on the issues, I am merely trying to describe the opposing view points accurately, and and their effects on the market.  Without getting into the weeds to deep, I think the question is valid - does the stock market have a conservative bias?

For the past month I’ve been trying to find the next big thing and I think I may have finally found it. TransUnion, SiriusIQ and UST Global are partnering up to make a joint venture company called CLX Health LLC. CLX Health LLC is introducing an app called Healthy America™️  that is set to be announced on August 6th to the world. The media will be disclosing it at 3pm EDT on August 6th. 

What does it even do?

Message from TransUnion on Healthy America:

In a world forever changed by the COVID-19 crisis, we’re committed to protecting American lives. TransUnion and its US-based healthcare technology partners have developed HealthyAmericaTM. This unique solution enables people to securely share test results, helping businesses, schools and consumers assess risks stemming from COVID-19 and interact in a safe, confident manner.
HealthyAmerica combines the power of TransUnion’s identity and fraud solutions, clinical data management capabilities of SiriusIQ, and business transformation assets of UST Global — together forming CLX Health, LLC. By leveraging and deploying our existing technology in a way consumers and businesses can readily adopt, it will be easier to mitigate risk in everyday interactions while maintaining individual privacy. Going forward, we expect airlines, large event organizers, restaurants and others will leverage the tool — which will easily adapt to changes in science parameters, including the evolution of a seasonal vaccine.
(https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/?=undefined)

What Healthy America is:

CLX Health LLC, a joint venture company, has developed the HealthyAmericaTM mobile application to be deployed as a key component of the HealthyAmericaTM Solution Architecture and Database. The CLX Consortium of partner companies have come together to manage the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses by accessing real-time laboratory testing data for operational business and consumer decision support, ultimately allowing the economy to scale back up to capacity.
Utilizing existing technology and infrastructure critical to delivering a solution now, the CLX Consortium has network access to over 1 million physician offices, 22 largest by volume clinical laboratories, 40 major hospital systems and 20 Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHC) in the United States.
In much the same way TSA PreCheckTM provided airline passengers with an increased level of confidence after 9/11, the HealthyAmerica application is positioned to mitigate risk of businesses and individuals. With TSA PreCheck in place, passengers returned to travel with assurance that fellow travelers had been screened and posed little to no risk. The HealthyAmerica application manages real-time and batch files of health status requests for consumers to provide businesses and facilities operational decision-making capabilities that can mitigate exposure to employees and clients.
Like the TSA PreCheck status, which is delivered in bulk to airlines and directly to the consumer via a Quick Response (QR) code, HealthyAmerica enables consumers to present a QR code indicating health status. With the HealthyAmerica QR code, individuals can securely gain access to government-restricted sites, such as airports and/or sporting events, as examples.
The HealthyAmerica application works in the following manner, first requiring the individual consumer to register. Consumer identity is verified in combination with mobile device authentication, then the consumer selects a laboratory, schedules testing and receives validated test results—all within the application on the consumer’s verified device. The HealthyAmerica application stores diagnostic or antibodies test results received directly from an FDA-approved laboratory and generates a QR code indicating current health status.(https://www.siriusiq.com/siriusiq-introduces-clx-health-and-develops-healthyamerica-tm-as-virus-response-mobile-application/)
My summary and analysis:

Okay so this app basically gives verification to other people on whether you have Covid-19 or not wherever you go. First you start off by scheduling a testing through the app for antibodies and then you send the tests to SiriusIQ labs where they see if you have antibodies. TransUnion then verifies your identity through your social security number making sure it’s you. Then the data is stored in the app which is federally regulated and presents proof of your safety from Covid-19. You can also opt in or not for contact tracing on it to see who is infected and not. I think businesses, airports and big events like baseball games will soon require this because it‘s as simple as scanning a QR code or sending a verification online through the app to wherever you're going to check if you are safe to be there both to yourself and others. It provides a more organized and safer way to open up the country and European countries as well and yes they have been approved by the European Union on this. Anyways I think this can allow countries to  open up in a safer way then the first time they tried. This would help both the economy and stock market. This will all go down on August 6th at 3 pm (EDT) when they announce the application and the media is to announce it at that time as well.

Take a look at stocks like JWN, NCLH, WFC, MGM, DENN... highly volatile before June 11 but mostly going steady, after. I have no idea when the next big rally for stocks like these will come but it’s bound to arrive eventually. Why? Because there’s more good news to come. Stimuli packages, FED money printing, decreasing infection curves, more going stuff going back to normal and of course hopefully someday a vaccine. 

The way I see it, the tech bubble may burst.. I’m not willing to take that risk. I’d rather stay sideways or take a little hit facing a slow descend while I wait for a huge rally to arrive. Then I’ll probably sell and switch to tech then because my guess the two may coincide; tech could go down when these other beaten down stocks go up.

I've always thought this stock was undervalued when compared to Netflix on a subscriber basis.  The reason is because its been around for over 2 decades and has not made a significant return for investors.  They burned a lot of cash on customer acquisitions which did not pan out as fast as they hoped in their goal to reach 1 Million subs.  But covid has seemed to be a tailwind for them and now they have just beat their own estimates and added over 50k new subscribers in the past quarter.  That's one quarter alone.  they have over 600k subs now.  It boggles my mind that this stock is priced at value stock levels when it's clearly become a growth stock since the pandemic.  I'm posting about it because i think if word would to get out to the robinhood community it would skyrocket.  Do your own DD though.

&gt;Ford has changed CEOs for the third time in six years, the company announced on Tuesday. Current CEO Jim Hackett will step down in October and be succeeded by his handpicked deputy, Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley.

If you place an order, whether it be a limit or market, and set the share quantity at let’s say, 10 shares, will the order only execute when there is someone selling exactly 10 or the specified amount? Or will you get traded a few from one seller and the rest from another?

The markets surged higher and the Nasdaq soared to record highs both intraday and close. Despite unemployment on the rise and the congressional stalemate. When in doubt buy.

Earnings season has yet to deliver any headline stealing surprises so far. Profits are down across the board and stocks continue to climb.

Summer trading is still a little choppy as futures are pointing towards a lower open. I'm still trading small positions waiting for conditions to improve. My watchlist is growing and speculation appears to be picking back up which bodes well for my morning momentum plays.

**Watchlist:**

**BLIN** is a low float, watching for at setup above $3.62

A few reasons why i want to start investing, first and foremost, i am recklessly spending money in games which i officially stopped a few months because of COVID, i noticed it wasn't the games i was addicted to but the gambling aspect. I understand i shouldn't be spending my savings!  


  
1. I wish to spend $1000 on a long term stock and $100 dollars weekly on others, which app is best?  


  


2. I thought there were just one way of buying stocks and that is just buy that stock at the current price and sell whenever you wish, but there seems to be multiple options, which is best for Long term, short term and mid term?  


  


3. You are only taxed if you sell your stock, based on the amount of days you hold varies, such as 15% if you hold it for 1 year and before 1 year it'll be added to your income earnings (tax bracket), but since i am not making income, i will be taxed below 15% (assuming i dont make 20k+ in stocks).   


  


4. If i buy a stock at $100 dollars per shares, and own 10 shares, then the market drops down to $50 dollars, i do not owe any money correct? Therefore, can't i just wait till it springs back up maybe back to $100 or with some luck it goes from $50 to $200, then i sell it at $200, gaining the profit of $1000 (before tax)? Or is there a time limit?

Re-election: Traditionally Republicans boost Defense, but 45 seems isolationist and combative metaphorically, not militarily. So maybe Defense goes sideways.

**Intent** : I have *X* amount of funds in CAD$ available for investment in a stock and I want to know how many shares I may purchase and the average cost of each.

**Problem** : I may have to deal with :

1. *USD currency with my CAD funds*
2. *an always-changing USD conversion rate*
3. *an always-changing stock quote*
4. *brokerage fees*

**Solution** : I input values in the calculator to obtain answers.

&amp;#x200B;

**FEATURES**

« Update » button to obtain :

* *real-time quote of the ticker you input*
* *real-time USD conversion rate*

« Profile » buttons to edit and apply :

* *default values for quick use each time*

« Calculate » button to obtain :

* *number of shares that can be purchased*
* *cost per share in CAD and USD (including commission)*
* *difference in price when commission exists*

## US Stock Futures Find It Hard To Gain A Strong Foothold

[Dow Jones](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=%5EDJC) futures fell slightly Sunday night, while [S&amp;P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=%5ESPX) futures were flat and Nasdaq futures rose modestly. But as of Monday, 6.31 am E.T., Dow Jones was up 0.11%, while the S&amp;P 500 and [Nasdaq Composite](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=QQQ) indexes rose 0.26% and 0.74% respectively. The reason that these [stock futures](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing) were trading a little soft could be because the U.S is likely to announce stricter measures against Chinese companies. The delays to a fresh tranche of fiscal support could also be a reason for lower confidence in the pace of the economic recovery.

## Microsoft Confirms TikTok Deals

U.S-China tensions could still be a major headwind for the stock market in the coming days. Microsoft said it held talks to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok. This came as President Trump is looking to ban the popular China-owned video social media site due to security reasons. Confirming talks between CEO Satya Nadella and President Trump, Microsoft said Sunday it is prepared to continue discussions to purchase TikTok’s U.S. operations until Sept. 15.

“Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns,” the company said in a statement. “It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.”

# Earnings Winding Down

Earnings for major technology companies have seen them crushing analysts’ estimates. Recall that we saw strong reports from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google last week. As we continue to wind down the earnings season, there are still some big names reporting their results this week. These include Disney, Square, and Activision Blizzard. There are also other notable names reporting this week including Roku, Wayfair, and The New York Times.

## Major Central Bank Decisions

Four more central banks are announcing interest rate decisions this week after the Fed did so last week. These include Australia’s central bank on Tuesday, followed by Brazil’s on Wednesday. On Thursday, the UK’s and India’s central banks will be announcing rates. Given the importance of these economies, analysts will be monitoring the decisions of these central banks closely.

## US Unemployment

Many will be looking forward to the release of the July unemployment rate this Friday. This will serve as a reality check. Economists are expecting a slight decline to 10.3%. This will be released together with a range of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on the U.S. labor market. The relatively small estimated drop in unemployment is not suggesting a quick recovery of the job market. That’s in line with the trend in the weekly initial unemployment claims. Also on Friday, the nonfarm payrolls shall provide additional insights on the impact of the ongoing crisis on different sectors of the economy.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,489424,public,confidence,self,Top 5 Things To Know In The Stock Market This Week,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/i33v84/top_5_things_to_know_in_the_stock_market_this_week/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'k-CKp3wIh0hCxtWWaAoorpgpK5ZqEUSrGUaJ1uG-3wU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 11, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27594d395f3315b951ace2fad82d1ee6afd17085', 'width': 108}, {'height': 23, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14f2795e52c81fb604aa512af51c9e8a61b2546c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 35, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99552db7d3eb3da6bc14b4b58cec31dceadc66f6', 'width': 320}, {'height': 70, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=109989fea44209a977a2514783ea70ef64589997', 'width': 640}, {'height': 105, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1bf68bd8e68c369ceed723204aea1660a2755dd', 'width': 960}, {'height': 118, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1007a781274d6409b90b6efe4e9377379872d19b', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 195, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Iin4wLkNx6J2hNYlduC2ImEZhmGXUVk4t_07baTJzyY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=526c8d12ad23c681526ba64357050fe7e8eb6fa4', 'width': 1779}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,
