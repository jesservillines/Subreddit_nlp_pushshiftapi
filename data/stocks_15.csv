Given the most recent volatility in the Chinese markets, I decided to not squander a wonderful crash and went bargain hunting, and will continue to do so for some time.

Recently, I initiated a long position on QD:NYSE (Qudian). In the past year, QD have repurchased &gt;25% of their entire market cap in shares. They're also growing at around a 20 - 25% clip, but have been priced for failure - despite all evidence to the contrary, sentiment is unbelievably bearish. Should the stock price drop (which it most likely will given the negative China sentiment), I have 2 more bullets ready to fire.

After listing at $30 in 2017, Qudian's value declined by more than 50% in one year, but this does not match their revenue or earnings trajectory. In 2014, they only had revenues of RMB 24,133; in 2018, their revenues grew to 7,692,343. During this time, they've maintained an EBIT margin &gt; 60% and have also gone from (169%) Net Margin to \~32% net margin. For 2019, they've forecasted Net profit of &gt;RMB 3,500,000.

**The two main reasons for selling off are:**

1. Fear of regulatory crackdowns by the Chinese government of the micro-lending sector
2. Loss of Alipay/Ant Financial relationship

The irony in all of this is that Qudian froze their own direct lending licenses back in 2017, and have been providing off-balance sheet lending via referral to licensed institutional partners for some time. Furthermore, the number of micro-lenders in China decreased from &gt;10,000 to around 1000 today - in other words, the crackdown helps not hurts Qudian, and this is evident with their registered user base growing to &gt;71mm with approved borrowers at almost 26mm.

Moreover, the majority of their institutional funding relationships are with major institutions and banks. They don't provide evergreen loans, and any defaults are reported directly to the PBOC, giving an incentive for borrowers not to default.

The loss of the Alipay relationship didn't phase Qudian much either, as whilst it drove a large majority of their traffic, it only contributed \~3% of their total revenues. What's also interesting was that after the loss of their Alipay relationship, the S &amp; M expenses decreased to 5% of total revenues vs. \~35% of total revenues, yet their Q1 numbers exceeded analyst expectations by &gt;40% (with their loan book growing 91%).

**Risks:**

Qudian is in a young industry where regulatory reforms are frequent. Furthermore, whilst they've maintained delinquency rates at \~3 - 5%, it's important to note that they guarantee in part or in full, any defaults incurred by their institutional lending partners (despite &gt;50% of their transactions being off balance sheet).

As of today, the PBOC has capped interest rates at 36% max. There don't appear to be any intention to lower this further, but if there are further cuts, this could hurt QD's profits.

**Conclusion:**

Qudian trades at a PE of \~4 today, and a forward PE of \~3. The combination of wrongly assumed regulatory fears and trade war/Chinese recession has beaten the stock down to its current lows. Having said this, if you have a stomach for volatility, I believe this provides an interesting opportunity for \~80 - 110% upside.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,364819,public,self,Deep Value - Qudian QD:NYSE,0,1560395813,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bzhyae/deep_value_qudian_qdnyse/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brace yourself for a new shareholder meeting starring Elon Musk.  


Tesla's annual shareholder meeting [live streaming](https://mpcapital.ai/events/TSLA/shareholder-meeting-2019-06-11) is starting in about 2 hours (2:30 p.m. Pacific).  


According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the bears still outnumber the bulls: Tesla’s stock has **12 Buy ratings, 9 Holds and 15 Sells**.

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla shareholders will convene for the company's annual investor meeting in California, amid one of the company's most challenging months yet.

Since they last assembled in 2018, Tesla's market value has declined by more than 30% thanks to a failed bid to take the company private by CEO Elon Musk, which resulted in $20 million fines for himself and the company as part of a settlement with federal regulators.

In April, shortly after Tesla and the SEC agreed on new terms regarding Musk's social media usage to end the months-long legal battle, Tesla announced that four members of its board of directors will leave their posts after their tenures are up.

Some analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic on the demand picture for Tesla's cars after those same fears drove shares lower by 46% this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Elon Musk is expected to lay out the challenges facing his company and investors will be voting to re-elect two board members, as well as on proposals relating to supermajority voting and a public policy committee.**

The company X has 100 shares where the stock price is $1. So, the company has a valuation of $100. Now, a specific investor wants to sell 1 share he owns. He offers the share at $1.2 dollars, and it's sold at that price. What is the price of the stock?

If its $1.2 means the price of the stock is determined by the price of the latest transaction, which implies if I have one share (at $10 the share) of the company Y (let's assume the equivalent to 0,001% of the company), if I want to move down the price I just have to offer the $10 dollars share to $1, and I would push down the price by 10% as any person would buy it as it's very cheap?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

This analysis will use three indicators (SMA 10, MACD, SlowStochastic) on a 15-year chart with monthly candles as proposed by Phil Town. These indicators can give independent BUY/SELL signals, but we will use the three in harmony with each other for a concrete signal. It is important to note we only recognize a signal once the month has ended and the candle is completed. The SMA 10 signals are quite simple. If price action ends the month above the SMA, the security issues a BUY signal, and vice versa, if price action ends the month below the SMA, it issues a SELL signal. The MACD is fairly simple as well. When the histogram turns green, a BUY signal is issued, but when it turns red, a SELL signal is issued. The Slow Stochastic indicator can be a bit trickier to understand. A cross above 80 is always considered as a BUY signal, while a cross below 20 is always considered a SELL signal. The phantom zone is described as being between 20 and 80. When in the phantom zone, the signal takes on whatever the other two indicators issue. When all three signals issue a BUY or a SELL at the same time, we can use these signals execute trades.

2018 started off with all three indicators giving off positive BUY signals (price action above SMA, MACD = green, Slow Stochastic above phantom zone). The MACD turned red in April 2018 while price action breached the SMA multiple times from February through May. However, the price action never ENDED the month below the SMA until October 2018, issuing a SELL signal for this indicator. Since the Slow Stochastic entered the phantom zone while the SMA and MACD were at SELL, its signal changes to SELL as well. Hence, all three indicators issue a SELL as of October 2018. Price action this February ended above the SMA, issuing a BUY signal for this indicator, continuing into March and April. This May, price action ended below the SMA, so a SELL signal is issued. However, the MACD remains at a SELL as of the end of May 2019. Closing April 2019, the Slow Stochastic moved above the phantom zone, issuing a BUY for this signal. SMA: SELL; MACD: SELL; SS: BUY.

I learned to used these indicators together through Phil Town.

It runs on 105 watts and will be shipping in September, Su said. And she said it is competitive with the competing Intel i9-9900K processor at less than half the price of what Intel is charging.


- AMD has shifted much of its processor line-up to 7-nanometer manufacturing (which, because of nomenclature, is the equivalent of Intel’s 10-nanometer manufacturing)


- Su said that AMD’s chips are targeting all parts of gaming — cloud gaming via data center hardware, PC gaming, and console gaming. AMD also recently partnered with Samsung to move into mobile markets. AMD’s chips will power Google’s Stadia infrastructure for cloud gaming, and AMD’s chips will be the heart of the upcoming PlayStation 5 from Sony.

The stock persists at higher than expected levels after one of the most successful IPOs of 2018 2019 so far.

The next closest IPO of 2018-2019 has been Zoom Video ($ZM) which is up a mere 185% compared to Beyond Meat’s 600%. For comparison Uber ($Uber) is down 3% while Lyft ($LYFT) is down 18%.

Beyond Meat shares jumped as much as 34% to $186.43 per share on Monday, marking an all-time high for the company that claims to be “The Future of Protein”. Shares for the company closed on Friday at $138.65. The IPO price was $25 per share.

Shares, which began trading publicly May 2, have soared altogether 560%, reaching a market value of approximately $10 billion. This forward price-to-sales ratio of 35 seems unsustainable. Tyson Food, for instance, trades for 0.7 times their sales. Credit Suisse analysts see a price target on Beyond Meat shares of $125 based on the company’s first-quarter report, as well as a 2030 sales estimate of $3.5 billion. Beyond Meat is trading for about twice that 2030 sales estimate.

According to Nielsen, Beyond Meat enjoys just 2% household penetration in the United States. That suggests room to grow for some. But, whether or not the omnivorous American consumer will ditch simple beef or an ultra-processed alternative remains to be seen.

To be sure, the U.S. market certainly isn’t the only one Beyond Meat is looking at. CFO Mark Nelson called Europe and Asia “very significant” markets for Beyond Meat. He noted that Europe already has a “very well-developed market” for plant-based proteins.

And the story of Nirav Modi, arrested in London in March 2019, is one of these. 

Celebrity jewelry designer Nirav Modi, coming from a family of diamantaires, was born in India, but grew up in Antwerp. After drop out of the college, Modi joined his family in diamond business and started to import duty-free cut and polished diamonds to the domestic market while sending low-value diamonds for making export jewellery. His  brand Firestar Diamonds became one of the most reputable across three continents with stores in London, New York, Las Vegas, Hawaii, Singapore, Beijing and Mumbai.

In January 2017 the Income Tax department of India raided over 50 offices of Modi and found cash and jewellery that allegedly revealed tax evasion of Rs 500 crore ($5 bln) by Modi’s firms. But that was just the beginning. Soon the State-owned Punjab National Bank has filed a complaint, accusing Modi and his firms of fraudulent transactions worth Rs 11,000 crore  ($110 bln) — nearly one third of the PNB’s net worth for financial year 2017. 

It was later revealed that two of the bank’s employees helped Modi by issuing fraudulent letters of undertakings (LOUs). The bank stated that accused firms presented a set of letters of undertakings with a request to allow buyers’ credit for making payments to overseas suppliers. No need to say, Nirav Modi was not going to refund these money.

Nirav Modi is now arrested. But how many more Modis are out there today, serving the inflated inclosed diamond market needs?

When talks about a trade war with China began in the past month, I sold all of my positions expecting stocks to go lower. As prices went lower, I very slowly averaged into stocks where I liked the price and bought long-term holdings. This is my current portfolio that i've built within the last month. 

Most of my positions are technology and healthcare, and i'm looking to add more names to better diversify my portfolio. To do this, I bought a position in Chevron, Beyond Meat and Altria.

I'm looking for some other names to add to my portfolio and I was wondering if you guys could give me some recommendations? Perhaps there are stocks from consumer discretionary, staples or materials that you think are worth adding to a long-term portfolio?

Right now i'm looking to add Procter and Gamble, Berkshire and Boeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for growth opportunities and I stumbled upon $EPAM.  IPO'd in 2012 at $14 and is currently sitting at $176.  Usually I don't like stocks that have already produced crazy returns but after looking at the numbers I understand why.

&amp;#x200B;

The company's year-over-year revenue growth from 2015 through 2018 was 27%, 27%, 25%, and 27%.  Even with this excellent revenue growth the company was able to maintain/improve margins, with gross margin between 35%-37% every year and operating margin took a step up from 13% from 2014-2017 to 15% in 2018.  It also has a very strong balance sheet and have made a few acquisitions in the past few years, showing that they're open to supplementing organic growth with inorganic.  

&amp;#x200B;

The stock peaked around $144 in August of '18 before decreasing to $105 by December.  It increased to $170 by mid-March and has been maintaining this level pretty well since then.  Reading through conference calls suggests the company knows there's some potential downside this year but they're still forecasting revenue to grow at a similar clip as previous years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am new into stocks. I would like to know how can someone build a strategy to sell stocks and fundamental difference between stocks and options?

Let's use AAPL as a case study, and assume that the stock price stays steady while we are holding the stocks. Let's say that it's currently trading at $177, lets say we have $1770 total liquidity, enough for 10 shares. Let's say that after one day, it becomes $177.5, it means that I can cash $1775. The profit after a day is 5$ - (fees of buy/sell).

Walmart isn’t looking to match Amazon on the number of items with next-day delivery anytime soon — and there's a reason why.

The retail giant announced last month it was offering next-day delivery — with no membership fee — for about 220,000 items on its website to customers in Phoenix and Las Vegas first, with plans to expand to reach about 75 percent of U.S. customers by the end of the year. Walmart said it also plans to add hundreds of thousands of items for next-day delivery in the future.

Precious gems developed an international supply chain which became a result of billions in losses each year. According to an investigative report of Global Witness, which fights natural resource exploitation, diamonds sales have been noticed on the markets of Facebook and What’sApp. 

The United Nations did their best to stop the flow of diamonds and in 2000 came to the decision “Kimberley Process” which presents a three-step verification to make diamond mining countries provide declarations on each stone. Now the system of export and import control works in 75 countries. Nevertheless, the resolution covers only rough diamonds used by rebel groups to finance wars against legitimate governments what means that jewellery market is not under supervision yet. 

“We see document tampering where one stone has been claimed across similar timelines with multiple insurers,” says Leanne Kemp, CEO and founder of Everledger, a company that uses blockchain to track and protect precious stones. They create a unique thumbprint on each stone, and now their blockchain system collects 1.6 mln diamonds providing information about authenticity and provenance of gems. So, the blockchain technology prevents double financing, or lab-grown stones from being falsely identified.   
Though, blockchain is used to make the global diamond market transparent and secure, it makes life easy only for manufactories, not for customers.

# **The market week ahead: Mexico tariffs and more data that may clear the way for a rate cut  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/07/weekahead-domm-190607-ec.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks have been rallying hard on the idea the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon, but at some point the market needs to see progress on the trade wars and economic weakness that are bothering the Fed.
*****
&gt; Friday’s surprisingly soft May jobs report showed just 75,000 jobs created, 100,000 less than expected. That immediately raised expectations that the Fed could cut rates as early as July because the long resilient labor market is now seeing the impact of what has already been showing up in manufacturing data.
*****
&gt; The stumble in the labor market raises concerns that trade-related weakness in manufacturing will creep into other sectors of the economy. For that reason, economic data, particularly CPI inflation data Wednesday, could be a key market factor in the week ahead, as investors attempt to game when the Fed could cut rates. There are also retail sales and industrial production on Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think investors will be nervous around trade and tariffs. Those will continue to drive sentiment next week. I think it’s interesting that you have this idea that the ‘Powell put,’ the central banks, come in to save the day,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “It may feel good for investors, and it may extend the cycle longer, but I do think it compounds the longer term problems...Eventually this is going to catch up with the market in some way or other.”
*****
&gt; **Mexico tariffs**
&gt; Investors are awaiting any developments in China, U.S. trade relations, and they are also closely watching developments with Mexico. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs of 25% on all Mexican goods, starting with a 5% tariff on Monday, if Mexico does not show that it is making progress in stopping migrants from reaching the U.S. On Friday, Trump said in a tweet there’s a good chance a deal will be made with Mexico.
*****
&gt; “The market was shrugging it off this week. It’s been a strong week for the market, so [investors] seems to be taking it in stride,” said Arone, noting investors were looking past the Mexican tariffs for now and focused on the Fed rate cuts. “The market seems to be applauding [rate cuts] right now, but I’m not sure accommodative monetary policy in itself is enough of a catalyst for better economic growth and better earnings. We need more than that. This could be a bit of a quick hit or a sugar high.”
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied after the jobs report, with Friday’s gains capping what was already setting up to be the strongest week for stocks since November. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4.4% for the week, ending Friday at 2,873. Treasury yields fell to the lowest levels since December, 2017 in the past week, with the 10-year touching 2.05% on Friday. Fed funds futures also moved sharply, and were forecasting a 95% chance for a quarter point rate cut in July.
*****
&gt; Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO, said the markets are now focused on the timing of a possible Fed rate cut and whether the Fed would cut by a quarter point or a half point initially. That makes economic data especially important, as investors watch to see if weakness has spread to consumers, in the upcoming retail sales report Friday, or whether inflation is weakening. Core CPI has been running above the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
&gt; “You would think the [fed funds futures] market is gravitating toward one cut in July, one cut in September and another in December. We have 2.9, 25 basis rate cuts priced in for 2019. This really raises the stakes for next week’s CPI, given core year over year CPI is over 2%, and also now because we’re in the Fed blackout period. There won’t be any additional guidance coming out of the Fed this week.,” said Hill. Fed officials do not speak publicly just ahead of meetings, and they are scheduled to meet June 18.
*****
&gt; Strategists have said the market is also holding up on the idea that President Donald Trump would not allow the trade conflicts to get so out of hand that they will cause a stock market collapse, since he views the market as a reflection of his success. That’s the so-called ‘Trump put.’
*****
&gt; Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, J.P. Morgan equity strategist, said if Trump proceeds with his threat to put tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese goods that could spark a major sell-off in stocks, and the S&amp;P 500 could go as low as 2,500. But he also expects that sell-off would result in both a ‘Trump’ put and a Fed ‘put,’ meaning Trump would take some action and the Fed could cut rates to ease financial conditions and help the economy. The strategist said he is maintaining his 3,000 target on the S&amp;P for the year.
*****
&gt; “We believe the next round of tariffs that the Trump administration is threatening—Mexico 5% and China Phase III—could substantially increase the risk of pushing the U.S. business and profit cycle into an outright contraction,” he wrote. Lakos-Bujas said he still expects trade agreements to be reached, in part because the Trump administration will not want to risk a market collapse or recession, ahead of an election.
*****
&gt; Lakos-Bujas said there are a wide range of possible outcomes, including a positive scenario where trade peace is achieved, earnings improve and the S&amp;P shoots higher to 3,200.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, investors will also be keeping an eye on China’s data. On Monday, China reports balance of trade, imports and exports, first quarter GDP, current account and foreign exchange reserves. Chinese inflation data is released on Wednesday.

# Not a Triple Top Yet – Support Has Held

&gt; There has been a lot of chatter recently about an imminent “triple top’ for the market across the January 2018, September 2018 and recent April 30, 2019 highs. It’s not a triple top until it breaks support levels. Traders do need to be watching for support levels to be broken - which we have recently held.

&gt; Holding support was bullish technical action. But remember this is the Worst Six Months and we expect more volatility, more testing of support and more sideways action – backing and filling – over the weaker summer months.

&gt; We talked about these support levels on the blog a month ago as well. Here’s an update to the chart from that May 7 blog post. I added some additional support levels. S&amp;P 500 level of 2580 at February/April 2018lows is critical support – a 12.4% correction.

&gt; Breaking that level would bring the December 2018 lows into play, which would be bear market territory of -20% – and likely the low and a great buying opportunity. Good thing we are already in Worst Six Months Defense Mode since we shifted to market neutral after our official Best Six Months MACD Seasonal Sell signal for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 on May 1.

# Seasonally, Bonds Have Plenty of Room Left to Run

&gt; Barring some rather abrupt reversal in the current trend in trade, tariffs, tariffs and even higher tariffs, bonds could have even more upside in their near-term futures. Back in the beginning of April we noted the 30-year treasury bond had a seasonal tendency to dip in April and early May (around the time stocks like to make a seasonal high) before moving higher from sometime in May through the end of August. Thus far this year this trade has been a perfect textbook setup. 

&gt; In the following chart weekly bars of the 30-year Treasury bond future appear on top with their seasonal trend since August 26, 1977. The 30-year Treasury bond did dip in April and as trade war concerns grew in May, as stocks slipped, bonds ripped higher. The recent rise has been brisk but considering the retreat in tech stocks further gains are not out of the question.

# The Bespoke Report -- Negative Void Coefficient

&gt; Equity markets surged despite short term interest rate markets pricing near-certainty of multiple Fed rate cuts this year. How can an economy so bad that the Fed needs to cut mean stocks go up? We take a look around for some answers. We also review just how dovish the Fed has been relative to what markets have been pricing of late. While the domestic economy has definitely slowed down from the torrid pace of 2018, even the disappointing nonfarm payrolls number today paints a different picture than assumptions of multiple cuts from the front end. The global economy is less constructive, but there's a difference between weakness and a recession panic, as we show. Finally, we present an argument for why Fed rate cuts may not be necessary for the economy to stabilize and start to pick up again thanks to negative feedback loops.

Powell only has another 2 - 2.25% interest rate to lower before things get to 0 - then what's he going to do? Also, I'm unsure as to how he intends to replace the all the layoffs which has been happening recently e.g.: Ford 7000+, GM 4000+, MGM resorts, 3M, 7200+ retail store closures.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, it's not only USA that's lowering its rates - Australia is at 1.25% and New Zealand is at 1.5% - all levels which haven't been seen since the great recession. Having said this, it seems like this charade still has plenty of room to run, despite there being no clear indication that the two sides are close to resuming trade talks...

I was wondering if someone can verify if i am correct or not in my understanding. And help with some questions I may have. I did couple readings on investopedia.

Looking at perspective of single and filing single.

1. you can move your capital loss deduction to future years. not locked into using it for the tax year you got your loss from.

2. short term capital gains is taxed at normal tax brackets. long term is much less.

3. you can deduct a max of $1500 on capital loss to your total taxable income. meaning if you had a net realized capital loss of $2000, you can apply $1500 in deductions and move $500 for future deductions (whether that be next year, or 10 years from now)

4. basic strategy in using capital loss deduction is to move you to a lower tax bracket. example assuming 2019 tax bracket is same for next year. lets say someone had a capital loss of $1400. his W2 income is $40,300. meaning $825 gets taxed at 22%. if he applies $825 of his $1400 capital loss, it brings him down to $39,475, or at the very edge of 12% tax rate. effectively putting him in the 12% tax bracket. and he can move his $575 left of capital loss for future use.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I’m not that gullible. 

I’m talking about individuals for example, like “ Tim Grattini” who is a young man who started off not knowing anything about investments and somehow became a millionaire by turning $1,500 to over $3Mill by investing primarily in penny stocks and using technical analysis as his main valuation tool.

or Ricky Gutierrez who became a very young millionaire within a couple of years by investing in growth/small-cap stocks on the other hand? ( There’s s video on YouTube on him called “ Making $11,000 vs $65 a Day). Pretty much a video on the day to day lives of a young trader vs an Uber driver. And how ppl that are broke actually work harder than the rich. 



I’m currently a University student majoring in Finance working my way towards my Masters Degree and have been very passionately interested in investing even prior to becoming a student. I also have my IFC and CSC Investment designations and am currently working as a Financial/Investment analyst intern for an IB. 

I have learned and applied enough knowledge from school and prior experience from investing to make a decent amount in investments from a portfolio of growth/small cap stocks, mutual funds, and equity ETF’s. Although I feel like I’m missing a secret analysis or evaluation tool that these people are using to become successful faster that I might missing out on? 

From what I can take here is what I know so far in terms of how these individuals became successful investors within a short period of time AND with not a lot of money to start:   

&gt; They knew nothing about how investments works, but this was compensated for the 5-6 hrs a day they passionately spent educating themselves about investments and in addition, giving them a lot of experience within a shorter period of time. 

&gt; Most were very speculative and had a high risk tolerance, investing primarily in growth stocks, penny stocks, hedging, implementing calls and puts etc. and taking advantage of market volatility.

&gt; All these individuals invested on Margin and were highly (50% or more leveraged). 

&gt; Most used technical analysis as opposed to Fundamental analysis as their main valuation tool. These include tracking chart patterns, historical and trend patterns, the use of moving averages etc. And some were contrarian investors. ( When most ppl are buying your are selling and vice versa). 
 
Now, what are your guys thoughts on how people like these are able to achieve this with little or no knowledge/experience in investing and not a lot of money and end up becoming wealthy within such a short time period? By intelligence and having strong analytical skills or just plain luck? 

Btw, any additional tips or advice on investing would be greatly appreciated!

So I'm starting with a small account, and I've put a small % of my account into an index fund. Its going well so far. However, I'm unsure what would be the most effective way to trade this to grow my account quickly. 

I've been thinking, I get charged for overnight funding by my broker every day, even on weekends, so I was thinking of holding something like 2 shares Monday to Friday, closing on Friday avoid the overnight funding tax without any potential profits. Then the next week, purchase 4 shares or more for the next week, Monday - Friday, and so forth and so forth, so each week I'm increasing my account by more. 

Do you guys think this is effective? is their anything else you would recommend? I should mention that I don't really like the idea of holding 2 shares for months and closing 2 shares for like $400, when I could close it in a week, buy more shares the next week, and instead of making $400 in a month, it could be $400 in a week.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,363090,public,self,Growing account via index funds.,0,1559939538,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bxllx1/growing_account_via_index_funds/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s the key though, I want to learn. I want to know what we’re doing before we look at this as a true investment. 

So we bought Iconix at 1.05 and it’s been going down. Not enough to worry about but the article I (tried) to link above had some things stating about SEC filings. Can anyone tell me what’s going on and what it means for shareholders?

By the time it had priced at $24, the higher end of a pricing range that was revised upwards, Beyond had raised approximately $231 million in IPO proceeds. When listed the free float was equal to 18.5% of the treasury stock method calculation of the fully-diluted shares outstanding, and the stock began trading at $46 a share off the propitious mechanics of an IPO with a constrained float and a low amount of newly offered shares as a percent of the existing preferreds. Beyond Meat is a consumer staple company that manufacturers and brands plant-based protein offerings that intend to be a simulacrum in taste and appearance to animal meat products and therefore a substitute to them, supposedly, for the environmentally and animal treatment conscious. Owing to this fact, Beyond Meat has repeatedly stated in their S-1/A that meat-lovers comprise the majority of their $35 billion TAM, requesting from retailers that their flagship product the Beyond Burger be carried adjacent to animal meat products. Beyond Meat's lofty goal of marketing plant-based protein patties to meat lovers on the premise of a secular shift towards consumer preferences being determined by ESG-related factors is admirable and by virtue of its decision and ability to successfully raise proceeds from the markets it remains a promising indicator of the strength of cause conscious consumer decision-making. However, although its mission and brand commitment is cohesive, the likelihood of it being realized beyond the extent to which the company has grown impressively for two years on the back of celebrity endorsement and the novelty value is slim. Most importantly, Beyond Meat's unflinching desire to cater to animal meat eaters by developing products whose distinction from other plant-based protein alternatives is drawn by their similarity to animal meat is an explanation for recent growth but also an impediment to sustaining its trajectory which would've been otherwise impossible but for a strategy built around earned media impressions. Evidence for the success of Beyond Meat's determination to achieve recurring sales traction from meat lovers is spurious and has undoubtedly resulted in net income losses and an accumulated deficit. For example, in Beyond's S-1 they mentioned "" At one of the nation’s largest conventional grocers, Kroger, 93% of Beyond Burger buyers over the 26-week period ended June 30, 2018 also purchased animal protein during the same period, which evidences Beyond Meat’s appeal to meat-loving consumers."" However, this can also be interpreted as evidence that those who purchase Beyond Burgers during a half-a-year period may have only done so once out of curiosity before returning to their meat based mains. It seems more likely that the minority 7% of Beyond Burger Buyers who only purchased Beyond Burger meat during the time period is more reflective of the extent to which customers who peruse the meat aisle may only devote themselves to purchasing plant based alternatives. From hiring 63 full-time employees in R&amp;D related fields and spending an average of 21% of net revenue on R&amp;D (Tyson Foods spends .3% on R&amp;D) to spending 40% of revenue on SG&amp;A expenses for the full year of 2018, even with margins expanding and expenses contracting as a percentage of net revenue, Beyond Meat's future performance cannot meet the expectations of those who have bidded up the stock to a value which implies a price to revenue exceeding 70 times. Assuming 30% top-line CAGR over 10 years, 24 pps gross margin expansion which already remains above that of Tyson foods whose gross margin has flat-lined at 12% for the past two years, 25 pps reduction in S&amp;M as a percent of revenue which remains the largest OPEX component, 14% wacc, and a 5% terminal growth rate, yields a fair value of $42. Assuming less lenient operating leverage as packaged food manufacturers tend to have less leeway in their ability to ameliorate their gross margins, with 41% revenue CAGR and a end of projected period NOPAT margin of 8%, we receive a fair-value price in a dcf framework that justifies the top of the IPO price range of $25 a share. Currently, Beyond Meat carries a hard-to-borrow rate of over 100% annualized for new shorts and the options markets imply a hard-to-borrow rate of 94.09%. I would short Beyond Meat either expressed through stock or an equivalent option position once the larger portion of the float which remains currently locked-up becomes free in November. ",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,362785,public,self,Reasoning Beyond (Me)at,0,1559859645,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bx8scr/reasoning_beyond_meat/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Lately my strategy has been providing decent returns, but commissions on my trades has been eating away at my profits. Is it a good idea to account for the money lost to commissions when setting when to take profit or to have a stop loss? The idea I had to do this was as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

Say my broker has a 2% commission on trades, which means that they will essentially take 4% of my profits per trade. 

Lets say I am buying 50 shares of XYZ which is currently at $10 and want to make $5/share (or 5\*50 = $250). With no fees, I would take profit at $15. However, commissions would take 50\*10\*0.02 = 20 dollars from this trade, so I would really only be making $230/$4.60 per share and lose out on 8% of my ""ideal"" gain ((230-250)/250). 

If I want to include the loss of commissions, I would instead place my take profit at $15.40 and also place my stop loss $0.40 higher than what my strategy would suggest. This would give me the desired $5/share.

As the result it caused terrible consequences for diamond miners and for gem wholesalers. But retail prices are considered to be stable as the changes on the diamond market won’t be accepted by the engaged couples who stimulate the demand. But that's what diamond manufacturers want to believe in.

Changes in the diamonds industry were firstly caused by new regulations with the aim to prevent a financial crisis.  Secondly, there was a massive anticorruption campaign, which made Chinese, who were one of the main diamond consumers, out of the market: they were banned of owning jewellery, which has already led to significant decrease of sales in Asian region.

The government pressure made banks in their turn act more carefully, especially when lending credits to the diamond manufacturers. Many banks simply stopped serving the diamond industry. For example, the Belgian bank KBC closed a branch unit in Antwerp, which was a rival for diamond manufacturers all over the world for many years. Bank Leumi in Israel had got out of the diamond business too, as well as ABN Amro in the Netherlands. 

Needless to say, that there a lots of manufacturers simply can't survive without banks' support. Why is this happening? Why the banks are getting out of diamond business?

I'm a gamer myself and am new to the stocks world. As I'm still learning, suggestions would definitely be appreciated! I've highlighted some info regarding the ETF below.


**- The ETF tracks video game publishers, streaming network operators and hardware companies that have established themselves as key players in the esports, or electronic sports, industry.**


**- Roundhill and Bitkraft used that definition to select the 25 stocks in the ETF, which is mostly made of game publishers such as Activision Blizzard and Take-Two. However, hardware-related names such as chipmaker Nvidia, which has been involved in esports for years, also feature in the holdings.**


**- Over half of the stocks in the ETF are Asian companies, many of which have a more broad-based foothold in the esports space. For example, AfreecaTV, a South Korean video streaming service known for broadcasting and sponsoring esports teams, leagues and events, is the biggest holding in NERD.**


**- Research firm Newzoo projects that the esports industry will raise over $1 billion in revenue this year.**


**- Esports investments in 2018 had exceeded $4 billion in disclosed funding by November, according to Esports Observer.**

The shares gained 70 cents, or 1.76%, to $40.50 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sees long-term profitability in autonomous vehicles.

&amp;#x200B;

Lyft shares increased more than 5% on Friday, gaining more than $800 million in value. The market cap is now $16.8 billion compared to Uber’s $67 billion. Just like Uber, Lyft has incurred large losses thanks to consistent promotions. Lyft reported an adjusted per-share loss of $9.02.

“While there is no guarantee that this will last, we believe that over the next 12 months both will focus more on competing via service innovations (micro mobility, loyalty etc), which should provide a significant tailwind to Uber’s unit economics,” Atlantic Equities analysts wrote in a note Friday, upgrading its rating on Uber from neutral to overweight.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that both ride-sharing services are public, riders can expect fewer deals. But, if price point becomes a determining factor for riders, then Uber likely has the advantage, since Lyft is a quarter of the size of Uber.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I don't think the trade deal is big of an issue that's going to be the reason for greater correction (where people target SP500 to drop insane amount like 15%, 25%, even 40%).

They're not available through Rob  inHo od or AllyInvest, which are the two brokers i use.

They  seem very promising.  Currently they're selling for 1,678JPY ($15.54)  and had a peak of 2,359JPY ($21.85), just a couple months ago and are  steadily rising up every day over the last few weeks I've been watching  it.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, June 3rd, 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/03/dow-to-fall-again-trump-visits-the-uk-and-mexico-set-to-talk.html)

* It's a new month for Wall Street, but so far it appears it will begin the same way the old one ended — with losses. The Dow has now fallen for six consecutive weeks for the first time in eight years, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have posted four straight weekly declines, as ongoing tariff tensions with China and now Mexico as well as U.S. economic uncertainty loom. (CNBC)
* Market drop in May felt serious, but it is normal for stocks (CNBC)
* The Dow's Friday close was its lowest since Jan. 29, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed at their lowest since March 8. And although the Nasdaq is still up more than 12% for the year, it is moving closer to correction with a nearly 9% decline from its May 3 record closing high. (CNBC)
* Goldman Sachs (GS) sees increased risks of escalations of U.S. trade disputeswith China and Mexico. There is now a 60% chance of the U.S. placing a new 10% tariff on the final $300 billion of Chinese imports. There is now a 70% chance of Trump imposing 5% duties on Mexican goods and a 50% chance that goes to 10%. (CNBC)
* US-China trade deal isn't likely at the G-20 summit this month, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley say (CNBC)
* Morgan Stanley sees global recession 'in three quarters' if Trump escalates trade war (CNBC)
* Top officials from the U.S. and Mexico are set to begin talks today over tariffs and border safety. ""Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border,"" the president tweeted. ""Problem is, they've been 'talking' for 25 years. We want action, not talk."" (AP)
* On the economic calendar, at 10 a.m. ET, both the May ISM manufacturing index and April construction spending are out. Some of the nation's automakers issue May sales today, although Ford (F) and GM (GM) only report on a quarterly basis. There are no major earnings this morning. Box (BOX) releases its quarterly number after today's closing bell.
* President Donald Trump arrived for his first state visit to Britain today. Cracks are starting to appear in the transatlantic relationship, with political analysts concerned that his ""off-the-cuff"" and ""impulsive"" leadership style could make matters worse over the coming days. (CNBC)
* Trump calls London Mayor Sadiq Khan a 'stone cold loser' (CNBC)
* Everything you need to know about Trump's state visit (CNBC)
* Trump tweeted that White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett will ""shortly"" leave his post, but did not provide a reason. It's unclear who's set to takeover, in a time of drama between the U.S., China and Mexico. (Reuters)
* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the White House's Mideast peace plan is possibly ""unexecutable"" and might not ""gain traction,"" according to an audio recording of the private meeting obtained by The Washington Post.
* Trump administration says it will negotiate with Iran with 'no preconditions'(NY Times)
* More than 300 Boeing (BA) 737 jets, including the Max, may have faulty wing parts that don't meet strength and durability standards, the FAA said, following a joint investigation with the aircraft manufacturer. The agency plans to order airlines to remove and replace the parts if their aircraft are affected. (CNBC)
* Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit is the subject of an upcoming antitrust probeby the Justice Department, according to multiple reports. The probe will focus on Google's search and other businesses. (CNBC)
* Apple (AAPL) is expected to launch the latest version of iOS, its software for the iPhone and iPad, today at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.The company has launched a new version of its iPhone software at WWDC every year since 2009, and analysts and reports don't expect this year to be any different. (CNBC)
* Facebook (FB) has been in contact with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about rolling out a digital currency, according to the Financial Times.
* SoftBank's bid to raise a $100 billion fund is off to a rocky start, the Wall Street Journal reports. Some of the world's biggest money managers plan to make limited or no contributions to the Japanese technology giant.
* Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) is discussing an improved bid for French carmaker Renault, according to Reuters, in order to win backing from the French government for a deal.
* Goldman Sachs (GS) is buying Capital Vision Services, manager of the MyEyeDr optometry practices, from a private equity firm and a Canadian pension fund for $2.7 billion, including debt, according to the Wall Street Journal.

That seems sensible.  Ulta has had remarkable success domestically in a highly competitive market so opportunities in Canada, Europe and Asia would appear to be large and enticing.  However, international expansion has many potential pitfalls so starting slowly in an adjacent market is to be recommended.


Ulta’s business model of providing positive customer experiences, a huge range of top end to mass market beauty products and meaningful rewards program has provided compelling growth in the US.  This has generated a virtuous circle with new customers signing up, leading to top end brands competing to provide products driving further customer sign ups.   


Fears of a slowdown in Q4 growth failed to materialize and recent results have been strong with Q1 revenues up 13%, comps up 7%, profits up 17% and EPS up 21%.  Domestically, the company has 1,200 US stores and envisages this growing to 1,700.  That shows a substantial opportunity to grow even without international expansion.  


Trading on 26x current year estimates the valuation is appealing.  The domestic business is thriving and has a long way to grow while international expansions offers huge opportunities.


This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are not suitable investments for everyone.

Hey,

I'm pretty new to this, so i don't really know how one should properly invest.

I'm young, and i have some spare money lying around. Not enough to buy real estate, so the next thing would be, well stock.

I'm  thinking about buying (obviously), specifically AMD (Advanced Micro  Devices), but first of all, i don't know how to evaluate a company if  it's good, bad, neutral / long run, short run etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't plan to jump out, but rather have that sucker in there and just let it sit as don't need that money, so 100% long term.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question would be, do you think if it's a good/bad idea, and if it is how did you come to the conclusion.

Also,  if you don't wish to share (what is 100% understandable, every man for  himself), what material should i read that'd educate me on the subject  of the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week and month of June ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 3rd, 2019.

# **Fed officials and Trump’s latest trade threat could decide whether June starts with a market swoon  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/fed-officials-and-trumps-latest-trade-threat-could-decide-whether-june-starts-with-a-market-swoon.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials speaking at a policy conference may get a lot more attention than usual in the week ahead after President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat against Mexico ramped up expectations for interest rate cuts.
*****
&gt; Markets will also start the month of June, which is often flat for markets, coming off a painful 6.6% monthly loss in the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Stocks lost ground in May on worries that the U.S. trade war with China would hurt the global economy and bite into earnings growth. They will begin trading in June with new worries that tariffs on Mexico could hurt the economy and threaten a new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.
*****
&gt; The coming week has a full calendar of economic data, with the highlight being Friday’s May employment report. There are also monthly auto sales and Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data due Monday, and international trade data expected Thursday.

&gt; But it is the Fed that should get the most attention, with central bank officials gathering at a much-anticipated conference hosted by the Chicago Fed Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make the opening remarks at the conference, which is about monetary policy strategy, tools and communications. For months, strategists have been hoping the conference will provide insight into how the Fed intends to address sluggish inflation.
*****
&gt; Interest in the event is even higher after the market and Fed watchers are increasingly convinced the central bank will now cut rates this year, and maybe more than once. The futures market priced in increasing expectations for two rate cuts after Trump’s threat to put tariffs on all Mexican goods if the Mexican government does not stop immigration into the U.S.
*****
&gt; After the last Fed meeting, Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory, suggesting the Fed would not have to cut rates, but markets still anticipate a rate cut, and inflation continues to run below the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
&gt; Michael Gapen, Barclays chief U.S. economists, said investors hoping to hear Fed officials discuss their thinking on current policy could be disappointed. Gapen said the Fed is also about nine months away from its decision on how it will frame inflation, and the conference will be more about academic views on it.
*****
&gt; Gapen was one of several Wall Street economists Friday who changed his view on the Fed’s rate policy. He said he now sees the Fed cutting the fed funds target rate by 75 basis points in two cuts this year, with the Fed starting at 50 basis points in September. The Fed has said does not foresee any rate cuts this year, nor hikes, and has stressed it is on hold.
*****
&gt; Gapen does not expect to hear much from Fed officials at the conference on rates, though investors will be combing through every word looking for policy clues.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think that’s the type of setting where anyone would make a monetary policy comment in advance of an FOMC meeting,” he said. The Fed next meets on June 18 and 19.
*****
&gt; Gapen said he went from expecting no Fed move to two rate cuts because the trade war with China has become more extended than expected; manufacturing and business spending are weakening, and because of Trump’s threat to put tariffs on Mexico if it doesn’t control immigrants heading into the U.S. over the southern border.
*****
&gt; “It does suggest the administration is willing to pursue multiple fronts. It lowers the bar for tariffs on Europe,” he said.
*****
&gt; Interest rates continued to slide Friday, to multi-year lows. The 2-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, fell sharply and was at 1.93% in late trading. The 10-year yield, at 2.55% in early May, was at 2.13% Friday afternoon. The S&amp;P 500 was down 2.6% for the week, ending its worst week of the year at 2,752.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief market strategist, said a “May mauling usually leads to a boom in June.” Going back to World War II, whenever there was a strong start to the year, the market traditionally fell in May but rose in June. Plus, this year was the third best start through April.
*****
&gt; John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said beyond the trade headlines, there are quite a few market catalysts in June.
*****
&gt; “June is going to be very event-driven. It’s going to be the Fed on June 19. It’s going to be OPEC on June 25; it’s going be the G-20 on June 29,” he said.
*****
&gt; He added, “We’re going to stay balanced and diversified because we don’t know how things are going to come out.”

# Time For A June Swoon?

&gt; Well, it finally happened. The S&amp;P 500 Index pulled back more than 5% from its all-time high, marking the first 5% pullback of 2019. As we have discussed many times over the past two months, the odds were high that some type of pullback or even correction (10% or more off the highs) was likely after the 25% surge off the December 2018 lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-Corrections-are-normal.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; May likely will be the first negative month of the year (down nearly 6% with two days to go) and likely will be the first time stocks closed in the red in May since 2012.

&gt; Now, seasonality hints to more volatility ahead, as June doesn’t have the best history for stocks. “We finally had a 5% pullback, but the bad news is June can be a tricky month for stocks,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Going back the past 20 years, only September has been worse on average, and returns have been quite poor in June after a big drop in May.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the day shows, stocks have tended to be weak in June over various periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Time-For-A-June-Swoon-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here are six thoughts to chew on as we turn the calendar:

&gt; * When the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5% in May (like it could in 2019), June’s performance has been weak. May has lost 5% or more only four other times in the past 50 years, and stocks subsequently fell more than 5% in June twice.
&gt; * However, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up more than 10% year to date heading into June (like it could in 2019), the S&amp;P 500 has gained 9 of the past 12 times (going back 50 years), and has been higher 1.9% on average.
&gt; * Equity markets in Greece, Brazil, India, Argentina, and Australia are all very strong. If we were truly entering a global recession, we would see more broad-based global weakness.
&gt; * The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) daily put/call ratio surged to its highest level since late December yesterday, suggesting a good deal of fear is coming into the market – a necessary recipe for a bottom to form.
&gt; * Only 31% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average. This is nearing washout levels, but could need to go down to 20% before the ultimate low can form. Still, we are getting closer.
&gt; * The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey has more than 40% bears, the highest since the start of 2019. That’s another sign fear is spiking, and pessimism could be a bullish contrarian signal.

# DJIA Six Week Losing Streaks

&gt; Barring a 700+ point rally into the close (hey, anything is possible), the DJIA is on pace for its first six-week losing streak since June 2011 and the 32nd such streak going back to 1900. As of this writing, the DJIA is down 6.46% over the course of this current losing streak, which would go down as the mildest six-week losing streak for the index since June 1976 and the fifth 'mildest' six-week losing streak on record. The chart below highlights each of the DJIA's prior six-week losing streaks since 1900 and shows how much the index declined during each one of them.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-Six-Week-losing-Streaks-1.png))**

&gt; While there have been quite a few six-week losing streaks for the DJIA in its history, it is not common for them to go on into a seventh week. As shown in the chart below, just seven of the DJIA's 32 prior six-week losing streaks have last seven or more weeks, and a 7-week losing streak stretching to an eighth week is practically unheard of with just one way back in 1923.

# DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Up Six Straight on June’s First Trading Day

&gt; According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019 (page 86), the first trading day of June is the sixth best first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 299.85 points since 1998. Over the past 24 years, DJIA’s first trading day of June has produced gains 70.8% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 66.7% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 58.3% as has the Russell 2000 at 62.5%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced six straight years on the first trading day of June.

# Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade

&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Looking at the chart above, shaded areas highlight areas of strength during the month. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into negative territory just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap. This June could turn out better than average as a result of a strong start to the year and weakness in May.

# Strong Starts Weak Mays Boon for June

&gt; Our previous analysis of big gains the first four months indicated weakness was in store for the merry month of May. Now that the market has indeed suffered this May the outlook for June is a boon at least historically speaking.

&gt; The table below shows the top 20 first four month gains for the for the S&amp;P 500 with the subsequent changes for May, June, Rest of the Year, “Worst Six Months” May-October, 2nd half July-December and full year performance. While most of the full year gains are clearly logged in these big first-four-month gains, there still upside to be had in the latter part of the year.

&gt; May is weakest and May 2019 has delivered market declines so far, down -4.9% for the S&amp;P 500 as of today’s close. However, after big starts, 7 of the 9 subsequent May declines were followed by big gains in June (highlighted in green). So, while we do not anticipate much upside over the next 5 months or so, June is set up for a boon.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 5/31/19

&gt; This week's economic data came in split down the middle with 12 releases coming in worse than the prior period or estimates and another 12 improving. A remaining 3 met expectations or were unchanged from the previous period. We noted this same pattern in our Matrix of Economic Indicators for April. The FHFA's House Price Purchase Index for the first quarter was the first release of a shortened week coming in unchanged from the previous quarter at 1.1%. Monthly FHFA and Case-Shiller prices also came out on Tuesday with both showing slower home price growth. Later that morning the Conference Board's readings on Consumer Confidence came in stronger than both forecasts and the April reading. The final release Tuesday, the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity, disappointed at -5.3 versus expectations of 6.2. On Wednesday, the Richmond Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also came in below expectations but was stronger than the April reading. The second release of Q1 GDP was revised lower but less than expected with growth for Q1 now sitting at 3.1% QoQ SAAR. While consumption growth was stronger, that came thanks in part to inflation measures falling below estimates. Retail and Inventories grew more than expected in April as seen in their Thursday release. Pending home sales were also notably weak. Friday data was better with Personal Income and Spending numbers both beating estimates. Michigan Sentiment was the final release of the week with a reading of 100.0 versus forecasts of 101.5, both below the 102.4 reported in preliminary data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-eco.png))**

&gt; With 34 releases, the data slate picks up next week. Monday we will get some important manufacturing data including the final data for May for the Markit PMI and ISM Manufacturing. Revisions for durable goods and the broader factory orders numbers for April will follow up on Tuesday. As next week is the first week of June, on Wednesday ADP will release their employment data for the month of May. This is expected to show fewer jobs created than April. The service portions of Markit PMIs and ISM will also come out Wednesday morning. In addition to the usual Thursday weekly releases, Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the first quarter are expected. The Employment Situation Report with its Nonfarm Payrolls number will round out the week in economic data on Friday morning.

My first trade went well and I made quite a bit of money off of it (in comparison to what I started with) but I can't help but feel it was beginner's luck. I held onto ENPH for almost a year, and even bought more when it tanked down below $4. Now I have all of my money investment money just sitting in my account begging to be invested in something, but I don't know where to begin again. All the stocks I look at and can afford seem to be going belly up, or have next-to-no profitability, and I am getting tired of trudging through the hundreds of stocks out there looking for one that has potential.

I see a lot of people on here trading with thousands of dollars, but I only have $1400 on my account at the moment. I want to learn how to trade now so that in the future when my career takes off I will be able to invest my money wisely, but I am having a hard time doing so in this market. I'm using Etrade, so I have to consider buy-in costs when buying a stock, which is a real bummer. I either have to go all in and hope the stock goes up 2% to even cover the fees I'll accrue from buying/selling it, or drop $500-$600 and hope it goes 4 or more percent to cover those costs. 

While I am not afraid of investing in longs, I feel that I don't get involved enough in those to steadily learn. I just drop my money on them and check in on its ticker everyday until something happens. 

In short, I am looking to better my trading skills by buying low-cost (under 10 dollars) stocks before I start playing with the big money.  I also need advice on how to more efficiently screen stocks rather than plowing through reams of data, starting at the top of the list of stocks and moving down.

The FDA has just approved Soliton’s tattoo removal (or rapid acoustic pulse (RAP)) device which, in clinical trials, produced significantly better results when used alongside laser treatment compared to laser treatment alone. Specifically, after three sessions, 100% of RAP treated tattoos had 75% or greater fading, versus only 16% of laser-treated tattoos.


That’s important because removal is expensive.  Visits cost between $100 to $500 and, currently, half tattoo removals require 10 visits with a quarter requiring more than 15. 


The potential market is large with 70 million people in the US having tattoos, 60% of whom say they have considered removal and 17% saying they actually regret getting them.


The potential savings that Soliton’s RAP device could provide are significant. Back of the envelope, if 10% decided to remove their tattoos and require 5 fewer trips at $200 per trip then the RAP device could save (7 million x 5 x 200) $7 billion.


That $7bn is a big number for Soliton which, even after recent rises, has a market cap of just $276 million.


Now Soliton is a high speculative stock.  There are many potential pitfalls for the company in rolling out this product.  Its very high risk, its a microcap, it has no profits or cash flow and dilution will almost certainly be significant.  


However, the $7 billion potential revenue is potentially exciting given the potential for further growth.  With 20,000 tattoo shops in the US more people are getting tattooed every day. In Europe another 100 million are estimated to have tattoos and globally, assuming a similar 20% of people have tattoos, that number could be around 1.4 billion.


The stock is not for widows or orphans but there is plenty of upside if it executes well.


This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are not suitable investments for everyone. Soliton is a high risk and highly speculative microcap. Please do your own research.

Started investing 3 years ago with the money I received from family to start off life. I dont know much on managing investments but I have made some good returns. Some stocks in my portfolio are up over 100% and with my losses limited at only -10%. Furthermore last year I started a separate tech portfolio and now the major holdings are up between 63% - 40% (Service now, Mercadolibre). Should I sell now and lock in profits on my big winners?

The service I use to find these stocks recommends holding 3-5 years but mostly what I read about these companies online is people saying they are bubbles and the price is not backed fundamentally anymore. During last years sell off I was able to sit still because gains were around the 20's. But since the start of this year the tech stocks have shot up like crazy to new highs. 

Should I consider myself lucky and take what I have? My risk tolerance is pretty high considering i'm sitting on good profits.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,361249,public,self,Massive Profits...Now what?

Why is it beneficial to invest in stocks paying high dividends if the stock price is adjusted or brought down as per the dividend amount on the ex dividend date?

Let’s say I invested in a $100 stock paying quarterly dividends at 4% per annum. On the first quarter, I get $1 in dividend and the stock gets adjusted to $99.

In the end, I’m left with the initial seed money of $100 that I invested with.

Emerging markets are made up of many countries not just China and India but also eg Thailand, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia. Many say that investing in the S&amp;P500 is enough because many of these countries do business overseas, but it is clear that there is one major risk involved in investing in one countries and that is political risk. All sorts of tariffs and restrictions can be slapped on and off. Diversifying across multiple countries mitigates this risk. Furthermore, tariffs on one country do nothing. For example, a tariff on China will just result in that product being exported to eg Japan who will then on-export it to the US.

Currently it’s %3  up. However looming legal implications against the CEO and Chinese tariffs are saying the opposite of stock value 

According to various news outlets the company has no clear successor should the CEO face legal issues. Also he supposedly has 80 percent of the vote for board of directors. It appears if he sinks the company could take a sharp down turn. 

I’m seeking advice of calling out options maybe a month out on JD. Please feel free to speak your mind as I’m sure many of you are more educated than me in these subjects.

I Done Goofed...

Tesla had been going back and forth between 300 and 330 for a few months it seemed, always staying within that range. I finally decided to buy in at around 300, thinking I could catch the upswing. 

Unfortunately, Tesla was struck with bad news a few days after my purchase (typical). Naturally, I assumed it was temporary and that they would bounce back as they had done so many times before. But alas, the bad news seemed to roll in more steadily as time went on. Now I’m stuck with Tesla sitting at \~$185 and left feeling like a total fool for trusting in them. 

At this point, what do I do? Do I hold and ride it out, hoping for any sort of gain above $200, or dump in the fear that they will continue to drop for the foreseeable future? I know the odds of me making back that $115 a share drop are impossibly slim right now, but if I could even get a sliver back I’d take it.

She has mentioned that I should invest in some ETF's which I may do.

I created this thread in order to see if anyone has any right off the bat advice or anything I should keep in mind. I plan to think of this money as not something I will use for anything besides investing since it was a gift for a specific purpose.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

With so many national threats I feel like this is going to be more of a trending topic.

Original article URL: [Defense Spending Picks Up As Security/Threat Detection Companies Like Northrop Grumman &amp; Others Position To Capitalize](https://market-trading.tips/kwn7c)

""Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) is a leader in aerospace defense contracts and development of cybersecurity. This company has the eyes of many investors thanks to a strong history of beating analyst projections.

I’m 23 years old. No job, no education. When I was 18 I learned about the stock market. I started trading stocks on my phone full time with a fake $100,000 dollars. Getting up at market open and trying to make a profit. 

After about four months I turned that fake $100,000 into roughly $64,000. Obviously I didn’t know what I was doing. I decided to keep studying knowing there are people out there who make a living day and swing trading stocks. 

After another six months of trading and extensive research, I not only regained the $36,000 I had lost, but also around $20,000 more. Not investing but day and swing trading. Soon after, the app and all it’s data were deleted. When I got a new phone, I started again with another fake $100,000. 

Since then I’ve turned that fake $100,000 account into roughly $250,000. Safe to say that after vigorous trial and error, I now know exactly what I’m doing, and how to profit consistently and aggressively trading stocks.

Right now I have a trading account open with a measly $2,700 in real money.

My obvious dilemma is that I’ve never had close to $100,000 in cash to set aside for trading. Not even $10,000. There are many regulations when it comes to trading stocks, for instance, the pdt rule, (pattern day trader rule) which was put into effect in 2001, says that no trader can take more than three day trades within five business days unless they maintain a balance of $25,000. 

Until I fund my account with $25,000, I won’t be able to trade full time. 

If I could take out a loan for $30,000 tomorrow I’d never have to work for anyone but myself for the rest of my life. 

As far as I know there is nobody who would trust me to pay back that kind of money considering I don’t have a job or a degree. (Why would they?) The market is open weekdays from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm eastern. 

I’m a great salesperson but it’s hard to find a good paying sales job that’s not a 9-5. 

I’m also not the greatest at saving and I’ve spent $24,000 on rent the last four years. (Cheapest it gets) I’ve spent those years working multiple jobs I couldn’t stand. Spending more time clocked in doing what I hate and asleep, than anything else.

Recently I got approved for unemployment benefits just so I have some time to find a job that won’t make me want to blow my brains out every minute I’m there. No luck so far.

I know if I want to go to school, the government will approve me for $30,000+ without looking twice, but why the hell would I go into debt and spend that money on school when I know I can turn $30,000 into over $100,000 in less than a year trading stocks?

Proof of my trades: https://imgur.com/a/RKQRP1f

If you look closely, you can see I would have made $45,000 in April alone without any losses.

I know I’ll get $25,000 eventually but I’ve been losing my mind the last four years barley making any progress. When I try to tell talk about it with anyone, most people look at me like I’m crazy. They’ll tell me it sounds unrealistic. (And it does) I really don’t know what else to do but it’s looking like I’ll have to keep doing what I hate until I save $30,000. (three years minimum)

I find it all very interesting and a little exciting. Been racking my brain trying to think of something I'd actually feel confident in putting money into that'll show good returns.

Cosmetic surgery sprang to mind. For a few reasons. In this age of social media we live in I feel people are hyper self-conscious and cosmetic surgery is becoming more normalised. A while back getting your face done would be something you'd only hear of aging Hollywood actresses getting done, now it's totally normal for any local Instagram influencer to get lip fillers regularly. It's also becoming more popular among men, incels etc.

Another point, more and more people are coming out as transgender as the world grows more tolerant of LGBT ways of life. Cosmetic surgery is often highly sought after by these individuals. I only see this demand rising as time goes on.

So, is this even possible as something to invest in? These surgeries are usually done by small practices, so they obviously aren't publicly traded stocks, as far as I can tell anyway. But is there some indirect way I can invest in this industry?  For instance, upon doing a google search I found [this Chinese company that connects users with doctors for cosmetic surgery.](https://technode.com/2019/05/05/so-young-stock-31-debut/)

So my idea here is that given the fact that these stocks such as CRON ACB APHA and CGC are not affected by the trade war or really anything besides maybe the occasional politician saying they don’t want weed legal in the US does anyone else think its a good time to buy, given the fact that the overall market is down and people seem to be pulling their money out of overall volatile stocks like this?

Yes I know at the moment these can be pretty volatile stocks, but the whole market is volatile right now. My considerations here are that these companies are mainly in the growth phase IE why a lot of them have posted negative earnings. In the long run though this puts them in prime positions to dominate any new market, the main one being the US. And in my opinion with the overall market down I think most of these are priced pretty well to buy right now. I’m not saying dump my whole portfolio into these, but maybe five percent total allocated to buying shares in each one just to possibly offset some red days.

&amp;#x200B;

Though, the story of how Berkshire Hathaway literally came to be \*\*completely\*\* contradicts that wisdom. For those un-familiar, 

&amp;#x200B;

In 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve. In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer of $11​1⁄2 per share for the company to buy back Buffett's shares. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11​3⁄8. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway#cite_note-cnbc.com-14) Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did). However, this put Buffett in a situation where he was now majority owner of a textile business that was failing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In 2010, Buffett claimed that purchasing Berkshire Hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, and claimed that it had denied him compounded investment returns of about $200 billion over the subsequent 45 years.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway#cite_note-cnbc.com-14) Buffett claimed that had he invested that money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), those investments would have paid off several hundredfold.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So with that, I ask, do you think Buffett's wisdom is sound knowing ironically the formation of his company today was built on contradicting advice?",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,360367,public,self,Anybody else find Warren Buffett's investing philosophy being somewhat hypocritical?,0,1559649162,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/buftll/anybody_else_find_warren_buffetts_investing/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a long term investor that always ignores market sentiment and invests in companies I believe in..

However I have a gut feeling that the market is going to fall big time before the 2020 election. I suspect the powers that be want trump out of office and are capable of causing market panic and inducing a big sell off..

I usually only hold 5% cash(risky I know but I’m young so fuck it). Should I trust my gut and increase this position to the 20-30% range? What are your opinions on stocks before the election?

While I'm in school, I get about 4000 a month. I was working full time but school is starting to cut in so I only work weekends. My total in bills is less than 2000.

I was mainly looking for dividends as I know nothing about trading. I'm holding a couple of Alibaba and 3 Microsoft, as I feel they will eventually increase, and I'm planning on buying any major dips.

I also have 5 in Micron Technology. Bought three a while ago at 54, because someone here claimed it was gonna shoot up(stupid I know). When it dipped down to 40, I bought 2 more, hoping i would come out on top if it went back up to 54.

I still have about 16 months of these benefits remaining. So I wont be needing to withdraw and hoping to be able to hold long term. I was looking around and the the low cost of YMNT looked pretty good with their dividend of 13%. Looking at their 5 year graph. They seem to be pretty stable.

How would you guys handle this?

To give you an example of the influence China has over the worlds rare earth elements (REE’s), the Mountain Pass Mine, once a powerhouse producer of REEs from 1965 to 1985, was completely shut down from 2002 to 2012 because of China, forcing its owner [**Molycorp**](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/molycorp-inc-826190-63907) into eventual bankruptcy in 2015.

According to Roskill, global REE production in 2008 was approximately 119,220 mt, of which only approximately 4,220 mt originated from outside of China, and U.S government officials are very aware of the threat this poses to REE market stability, as expressed by Mike Pompeo on [**May 11, 2017**](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1705/11/ath.02.html)

[**Rare earth production from 2013-2018**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268011/top-countries-in-rare-earth-mine-production/)

The defense industry in the U.S obtains 100% of its REE’s from China, and a 2016 Government Accountability Office [**report called**](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-161) this a “bedrock national security issue”, and rightfully so. Below are some detailed charts showing each REE’s use and source county (source:U.S. Geological Survey)

China also controls about [**85 percent** ](https://breakingdefense.com/2016/03/pentagon-fails-to-act-on-crucial-rare-earth-minerals/)of the REE’s used in consumer products, an astronomical number. As you may know, REE’s are essential to the entire tech industry, and without them, the United States would cease to function.

The PRC already manages mining levels.[ **South China Morning Post reports**](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3010977/xi-jinping-visits-rare-earth-minerals-facility-amid-talk-use) that, due to production quotas, the country became a net importer of rare earth last year.

Chen Daoyin, a Shanghai-based political researcher said, “We have to be prepared for the possibility that economic confrontation with the US may persist over the long term.” A statement like that makes you wonder if all the tariff negotiations headlines we have been inundated with lately are just smoke and mirrors. Are these negotiations even serious, or just formalities? We are going to have to wait and see, but if we were to make a judgment based upon the way events have unfolded so far, it wouldn’t be surprising if this was the case. Trump sure loves tweeting about China, which makes you wonder if somebody has access to his tweets before the rest of us. Whoever did could potentially make billions off this information -- Yes, BILLIONS, no hyperbole. Fire and Fury, remember that? The VIX went up how much? Every time he tweets or says anything about the stock market, the reaction is fierce. Wouldn't you love to be the guy who knows what he is going to tweet before everybody else!

&amp;#x200B;

It made me wonder why that is exactly? I understand because they're leveraged that obviously comes with more risk. Since the indexes (generally speaking) go higher wouldn't long term option calls be a decent move to make?

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, I know 600 days is not long term necessarily. Sure a huge correction or maybe even a recession could take place and then 600 day options really seem like no time at all. I don't know I just figured I would have seen more activity there on these options for these leveraged ETF's

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

[https://www.thestreet.com/markets/alibaba-shares-buying-opportunity-14971764](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/alibaba-shares-buying-opportunity-14971764) 

 

The recent decline in Alibaba shares represents a good buying opportunity, wrote Stifel analyst Scott Devitt on Friday, adding the Chinese e-commerce giant to the company's Select List of top investments. 

The stock has fallen 20% to $156 a share since the close on May 3, the last trading day before President Trump imposed higher tariffs on Chinese goods just as the market was pricing in optimism a trade deal would be agreed on. 

Devitt noted the stock is down 12% since May 15 when Alibaba reported a stellar earnings report in which it beat earnings per share estimates by 33% on the back of explosive revenue growth in cloud computing and strong performance in its core e-commerce business. 

""While it is impossible to predict the timing of resolution of certain macro events, we believe the recent pullback has created an opportunity to own shares with a long-term investment horizon,"" Devitt said. 

Shares of Alibaba closed down .64% on Friday to $155.00.

Devitt mentioned that Alibaba now trades at a 2021 expected EBITDA multiple of 13, ""and is even cheaper on earnings from the company's core marketplace-based businesses (primarily Tmall and Taobao; 55% of F2019 revenue)."" The current EBITDA multiple ""compares to other large / megacap U.S. or global eCommerce and digital advertising peers trading at an average of 12x on forward- two year EBITDA."" Amazon , for example, trades at a 2021 EBITDA multiple of 13.5. Meanwhile, ""Alibaba expects to maintain an organic growth rate in the mid-30% range in F2020, significantly above the peer group,"" Devitt said. 

Devitt also pointed out that Alibaba does very little business with the U.S., and that the long-term trends in the Chinese economy are a tailwind for Alibaba. While many are concerned China's economic growth is decelerating, ""long-term secular trends such as the growing middle class and the economy shifting more towards services are more important to Alibaba's long-term growth trajectory,"" said Devitt. ",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,359902,public,self,"Buy Alibaba Shares on the Dip, Says Stifel, Adding It to Select List",0,1559638760,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/btv5k4/buy_alibaba_shares_on_the_dip_says_stifel_adding/,all_ads,6,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '6JPsRhtxlHO6ncxA78SBoFYZ6zEELJ46ROnFmYzjiv0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BBBS-9Tt_ZwA675i8KTOAtfiVMk1Z7a2zHYVhaeEa7g.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e09d2609580aa050b4fd3cf4ada65a64e4a6e9b8', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BBBS-9Tt_ZwA675i8KTOAtfiVMk1Z7a2zHYVhaeEa7g.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=340fd47a9073c2ac9a89d0b62ba2b33e744989ab', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BBBS-9Tt_ZwA675i8KTOAtfiVMk1Z7a2zHYVhaeEa7g.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2db1e663fb6b77a96b6a2f5ad94903fc174b0c55', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BBBS-9Tt_ZwA675i8KTOAtfiVMk1Z7a2zHYVhaeEa7g.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a327f99d759e5cdc57118bcfca3c0de45bc9b789', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BBBS-9Tt_ZwA675i8KTOAtfiVMk1Z7a2zHYVhaeEa7g.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03a0bdb7956ecf6eecee409caaf0b14c6383ea8d', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BBBS-9Tt_ZwA675i8KTOAtfiVMk1Z7a2zHYVhaeEa7g.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da31f69489c1c77ab59bcf62486d74fdd7bd242', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 768, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BBBS-9Tt_ZwA675i8KTOAtfiVMk1Z7a2zHYVhaeEa7g.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=7894b61d77c567ee69bed4478cef10f1f9051f0f', 'width': 1152}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

To start of the Stock Market 101 page I think that we should start with the history of Stock Markets because with an institution as old as the stock market it would be a shame to not know about their history.

If we’re talking Stock Markets we should talk about money. Before money, we used to barter for goods and services and while it worked sometimes it was a system of trade that was very inefficient. Because of this people needed to create a system of trade that was based on the goods that they sold but didn’t have the same restrictions as having to trade actual things. So we created money that was based on the value of different things, for most of history we set this value to precious metals such as gold and silver so that the currency didn’t inflate and didn’t become worthless.

Now because money isn’t an actual commodity it can be lent out and borrowed. That’s because money is simply the value of something, not actually an item. So, because of this, the first widely acknowledged brokerage began in France in the 11th century as a way to help banks manage the debts of farmers. The people who ran these were known as the courtiers of change (or exchange brokers) and effectively traded these debts between clients and each other in exchange for a small commission, essentially they were bond brokers of their time.

Around the same time, the Merchants of Venice began to dabble in the trade of government debt. Because governments need to do government things such as going to war they would need to take debts because war is expensive. Investors would buy bonds from these governments and they would trade between themselves. Eventually, this trading began to spread across Europe and eventually landed in many places but nowhere was this more popular than in Belgium. As there weren’t any official exchanges these trades would take place in coffee shops. Eventually, these coffee stores and other places of gathering became so wildly popular that these investors created their own buildings and areas for the purpose of exchanging these debts. The center for these kinds of exchanges became Antwerp, a city in the north of Belgium where exchanges were created and eventually this practice radiated outwards to other areas of Northern Europe. We still couldn’t call them stock markets/exchanges because stocks didn’t exist at that point.

Stocks came to existence for one reason, risk. The Netherlands at the time was basically a merchant republic, and therefore a center of trade, and because of this a lot of these bonds were exchanged for and traveled through the area. The Dutch East India Company was a trading company that wanted to be part of the very profitable spice and silk trade, but it was a risky venture. Most of the ships that would go on the voyage wouldn’t come back creating a situation with a lot of risks and a lot of rewards. As a result, the Company looked around them, and at the government practice of selling debt in order to finance risky projects and decided to do the same. They would sell debt in their company for a percentage of profits in their ventures. And that’s how the first publicly traded company was made. They needed a place to trade these shares and for that reason, the first stock market was created. It was a place to trade shares for ships within the Dutch East India Company.

My name is Leyton and this is a update since i wrote my first topic on reddit, i explained what i want to accomplish during three years, dreams to fulfill and goals i have etc (link: [First Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/af8kez/looking_for_the_dreamers_and_doers_my_story/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)) *(Pause, read that topic and come back!)*

It's been five months since i created that post which means i've recieved 5 paychecks, I've invested 68,96% of my salary each month which adds up to a total of 9 500$. When i wrote that post i had a net worth of 16 000$, and now i have 29 112$ which is a major step to financial independence. Haven't touch alchohol for 168 days. Worked 53 hours overtime and in the post i wrote i invest 80% of my salary which i couldn't manage to do for a long time since unexpected expenses came up which i guess is part of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

***What's been though so far?***

It's been extremely though some periods, i've been having the ""fear of missing out"" but then i read about the emotions you feel about missing out on things and it helped me see it from another perspective. This is only the start, i've completed 13,8% of my goal but while not spending, enjoying yourself with materialistic things the time goes by slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

***What am i trying to improve?***

My monthly budget is 500$ and im not spending it very wisely so i am going to improve how i spend my budget cause im usually lazy and don't make my lunch by myself and ending up buying fast food which is really expensive compared to what i could make a dinner for. 

I'd also like to improve my physical health by starting working out cause i am exhausted when i come home from work, this was the first weekend i had a break, before that i worked 6 days a week, four weeks straight and im pretty weak. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that im just going to make everything better, the phsychological part is the thoughest, it's your mindset you have to master and i made this post ""update"" since i wanted to tell you how the journey has been, to show what i said in actions instead of words.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many speculations what this could be, and I find it interesting that they aren't announcing it through Twitter, [tesla.com](https://tesla.com) or any other mainstream way. To me, this looks like an ""under the radar"" announcement. Could ofc. be hyped up more until Friday.

The China factory is expected to be completed soon, and there are rumors that they are starting to hire for Shanghai Giga. Last time they made a ""surprise announcement"" like this, the stock had some bullish days before it took a drop after the announcement of model Y.

This announcement seems to be China only, and even if you look at the teaser picture, it looks a lot like a vehicle (in my view). To announce the whole factory like this is also a little weird.  Is this a new model, or eventually an own version of model 3 for the Chinese market? Tesla Roadster or more info on model Y?

The pick-up truck seems unlikely since it should be aimed at the US market. Tesla semi I still possible, and we haven't heard too much of it.

The Chinese text on the picture apparently states "" preparing for quick release of accumulated power "". Sounds a like it could be about super-chargers, but the picture doesn't make too much sense in that regard.

You see, it was easier  for Google to come up with Android than for Nokia or Motorola to drop  their OS and start fresh.  This is the same case with the combustion  engine car companies.  


I hope that Apple realizes that they should buy Tesla if only to avoid an Android like competitor in the long term.

The appeal to me for the essays of warren buffet is that I will not be questioning the authors credentials and it will hopefully be more helpful as it is current.   

I know the other book is highly regarded, but it is worrying that it is so old I don't know how relevant everything will be today.

I am not sure if this is a thing, but I'd even be interested in possibly working with someone who does this professionally like they'd work with me and bounce ideas on how to invest my money for some type of percentage of the profit.

**Weibo** \[WB\], a social media giant, fell 3.8% on Friday to $43.66 and is now down 69% from its peak in January 2018.

**Baidu** \[BIDU\] has plunged 26% over the past six trading days alone to $114.47, and is down 58% from its 52-week high.

**JD.com** \[JD\], an online retailer, has plunged 48% from its all-time high in January 2018, to $26.32.

**Tencent Holdings**, the conglomerate with holdings in social media, payments, video gaming, and tech: Its ADRs \[TCEHY\] have dropped 25% from the 52-week high and 33% from the peak in January 2018, to $40.86.

**Sina Corp** \[SINA\], an internet portal, plunged 5.9% on Friday and 37% so far in May. It’s down 67% from the top of the range it traded at in the January-March period of 2018. The shares have traded in the US since its IPO in March 2000, just as the dotcom bubble was starting to blow up. These shares are now down 70% from their all-time high in 2011.

*****
&gt; Trade headlines could be a big factor for markets in the week ahead, but investors will also be attuned to fresh inflation data and moves in the bond market, which is flashing new worries about the economy.
*****
&gt; Stocks were on a roller coaster ride in the past week, as markets reacted to worsening trade tensions and concerns that negotiations could be prolonged, causing pain for the global economy. But the bond market’s move was perhaps even more dramatic, as yields, which move opposite of price, fell to levels last seen in 2017, and the futures market began to price in three Fed interest rate cuts by the end of next year.

&gt; “There’s not a lot of economic data next week, so events hang over us,” said Marc Chandler, chief global strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It’s more about the evolution of old issues than new issues, like trade and Brexit.”
*****
&gt; Brexit will continue to be a focus in global markets. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May stepped aside Friday after failing to get agreement on a plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Chandler said investors will be watching the jockeying among candidates hoping to succeed Prime Minister May, with hard line Brexit proponent Boris Johnson expected to seek the job, among others.
*****
&gt; As for trade, Chandler said it’s possible that President Donald Trump’s comments that Huawei could be part of a trade deal may be the start of a new approach by the administration to tone down its rhetoric. The telecom giant has been blacklisted by the U.S. and is expected to be denied access to U.S. components for its equipment.
*****
&gt; “In some ways, it’s a headline problem. We think of it more as event risk,” said Nadine Terman, CEO and CIO at Solstein Capital. “China thinks in dynasties and U.S. investors seem to think in durations of days and months, so I think we are misunderstanding the duration of their negotiating strategy.”
*****
&gt; She said the issues between the two countries go way beyond trade and extend to China’s military aspirations in the South China Sea and its global campaign of influence through the Belt and Road initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature program.
*****
&gt; “It’s now become more nationalistic, emotional, to say: ‘We’re going against the U.S. and we’ve got to be in it for the long haul.’ I don’t think you have the same emotion here in the U.S. You don’t have the same nationalistic pride to say ‘we have to fight China at all cost,’” she said.
*****
&gt; In the past week, Wall Street increasingly began to expect the Trump administration to turn up the pressure on China with another wave of 25% tariffs on the $300 billion or so in goods remaining that have no tariffs. Those tariffs would directly hit American consumer goods and are expected to take a bigger bite out of the economy.
*****
&gt; Fears of a trade war hurting global growth and concerns that the U.S. is already beginning to weaken were evident in the bond market. Treasury yields reflected lowered growth expectations. The 10-year hit a low of 2.29% on Thursday and was at 2.32% Friday.
*****
&gt; J.P. Morgan economists Friday downgraded their view of the economy, slicing second quarter growth to just 1% from an earlier forecast of 2.25% and first quarter growth of 3.2%. The economists blamed weak U.S. manufacturing data and said risks were signs of weakness in the global economy and also indications that the trade war was hurting business sentiment.
*****
&gt; “The concerns the markets have right now are that we’re moving towards a worst case scenario, and that could persist for quite some time,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “If that’s the case, then the market is believing economic data, and the Fed will likely need to respond to that by trying to offset and prevent a recession.”
*****
&gt; The most important data point in the coming week will be Friday’s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the PCE deflator inflation data that the Fed monitors. It was at 1.6% year-over-year last month, and is expected to be the same for April, well below the Fed’s target of 2% inflation.
*****
&gt; Inflation has become a key focus on Wall Street, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory and not enough of a concern to make the Fed cut interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have stressed the Fed is pausing in its rate hiking cycle, is monitoring the economy and does not yet know which way it will move next.
*****
&gt; Solstein Capital’s Terman said she is watching the PCE inflation report to see if it confirms her view that inflation and the economy will be weaker this summer.
*****
&gt; She also expects the markets to be choppy, and by late summer, around its annual Jackson Hole symposium, the Fed could indicate it could cut interest rates.
*****
&gt; “People are going to start getting even more concerned this summer about the U.S.,” Terman said.
*****
&gt; Terman said she has been positioned for lower inflation and slower GDP growth with key holdings in utilities, REITs, Treasurys and gold.
*****
&gt; “What would do well this summer? Staples, utilities, health care, REITs. You want fixed income. You want to be underweight tech, energy, financials and industrials,” she said.
*****
&gt; There is also home prices data Tuesday and advanced economic indicators Thursday. That comes in addition to a few earnings reports, including Costco, Ulta Beauty and Dollar General.
*****
&gt; Markets will also be watching the outcome of European parliamentary elections, and if there is a strong showing by populists, there could be a negative impact on the euro and risk assets.

# S&amp;P 500 Down Four Straight Day After Memorial Day

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 27. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off with family and friends please take time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last four years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has since more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# The Bespoke Report - It's All Relative

&gt; Hut, Hut, Cut! With weaker economic data to contend with this week on both a domestic and international basis, plus escalating tensions between the US and China, investors are increasingly pricing in a higher likelihood of rate cuts from the FOMC before the year is out. Through mid-day Friday, the Fed Fund futures market was pricing in over an 85% chance of a rate cut between now and the January 2020 meeting. Those are the kind of odds that would make James Holzhauer say ""All in.""

# Fed Members Side With “Transitory” Inflation

&gt; Investors just got more details on Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers’ views of inflation.

&gt; Minutes of the Fed’s most recent meeting, which ended May 1, showed that “many participants” considered slowing consumer inflation as “transitory,” and agreed that the Fed’s current patient approach should help stoke economic growth and inflation. Policymakers’ optimistic view on inflation runs counter to a growing opinion in financial markets that slowing growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) could warrant lower rates.

&gt; Markets think the grace period for a “transitory” excuse has passed, but data show it’s too soon to tell. Another measure of inflation, the Fed Bank of Dallas’s “trimmed mean” PCE measure, points to higher pricing pressures ahead. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the trimmed mean PCE, which has proven to be a less volatile version of core PCE, has hit 2% year-over-year growth for the past several months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Slowing-Core-PCE-Due-Transitory-Factors.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “It’s tough to make a case for lower rates with over 3% gross domestic product growth, healthy wage growth, and a labor market close to full employment,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “If consumer inflation picks up, the U.S. economy will be near full employment with healthy inflation across the board, fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate.”

&gt; Of course, much has happened on the global front since the Fed’s last meeting. Trade tensions have flared up again, with the United States raising tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to increase rates on the remaining swath of goods. Logically, tariffs should be a catalyst for higher consumer inflation, as higher costs should boost price growth. However, the opposite has happened over the past few months, and there are several factors to consider when thinking about future inflation.

&gt; Overall, we don’t see a strong argument for a rate cut right now, and we side with the Fed in thinking consumer inflation could pick up as wage growth accelerates and growth stabilizes. At the very least, it’s becoming more obvious the Fed doesn’t have enough clarity to move policy in either direction.

# Another Reason For Bulls To Smile

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has officially gained each of the first four months of the year for the first time since 2013. This comes on the heels of the best first quarter since 1998. Six straight months in green has been the best monthly win streak to start a year, and that last happened in 1996.

&gt; Starting a year with strength like this historically has been a good sign, even though stocks in May saw a nearly 5% correction.

&gt; “Although we wouldn’t be surprised to see continued volatility over the coming months, the good news is a great start to a year has had a funny way of eventually resolving higher,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the rest of the year has been higher an incredible 14 out of 15 times after the first four months were in the green!”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 returns the rest of the year (final 8 months) have been more than twice as strong as the average year returns—10% versus 4.7%—following four straight monthly gains to kick off a new year. There’s always a catch though, and in this case we’ve seen an average pullback of more than 8% the rest of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-Strong-Start-To-A-Year-Has-Bulls-Smiling.png?ssl=1))**

# Earnings Season Takeaways

&gt; We consider earnings season a success based on the amount of upside to prior estimates generated by S&amp;P 500 Index companies despite several headwinds. Companies handily beat expectations to get first quarter earnings up to flat, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Looks-like-we%E2%80%99ll-avert-an-Earnings-recession.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; When earnings season began in mid-April, consensus estimates called for a 4–5% drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet data. Beating results by this much is impressive considering persistent trade uncertainty and the drag on overseas profits from a strong U.S. dollar. Also consider that the median stock in the S&amp;P 500 has grown earnings several percentage points faster because a few large companies are dragging down the market-cap-weighted calculation.

&gt; Resilient estimates are also encouraging. Since April 15, the 2019 consensus estimate for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share has risen slightly to $168 (a 4% year-over-year increase). We consider that a win given that estimates typically fall during earnings season.

&gt; “Escalating trade uncertainty and the threat of more tariffs are huge wild cards for corporate profits,” said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We are hopeful that significant progress can be made on the trade front next month, when President Trump and China’s President Xi are expected to meet at the G20 summit. A prolonged impasse that lasts through the summer would make mid-single-digit earnings growth difficult to achieve in 2019.”

&gt; Our base case remains that we will get a trade deal with China early this summer and consensus expectations for 3–4% earnings growth may prove to be conservative. Earnings are hardly booming, but with a continued economic expansion, low inflation, and low interest rates, we see enough earnings growth ahead to push stocks up to our year-end S&amp;P 500 fair value target of 3,000—though it probably won’t get there in a straight line.

# Pre-election Year June: Tech and Small-caps Best

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 48 years as a rule ranking eighth with a 0.6% average gain, up 26 of 48 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (–0.02% average). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, June ranks no better than mid-pack. June is the #8 DJIA month in pre-election years averaging a 0.8% gain with a record of nine advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #5 with an average gain of 1.2% (10-7 record). Pre-election year June ranks #6 for NASDAQ and #7 for Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.9% and 1.1% respectively. Recent pre-election year Junes in 2015, 2011 and 2007 were troublesome for the market as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ all declined (Russell 2000 eked out a modest gain in 2015).

This has been happening since Tesla paid their convertible bond obligation of $920 million. The stock has dropped lower than 2016 prices. Why is that?

Let's look at how the stock grew.

From December 2, 2016 to June 23, 2017, TSLA went from $181.47 to $383.45. That's a rapid rise. TOO rapid.

Short selling was banned in 2008. Along with it, the convertible-bond market went down. Except, now short selling is stronger than ever.


A suppressed stock price affects ongoing ability to obtain financing, raise capital through selling stock, and create a negative image for the company.

But why artificially inflate the stock in 2016 to 2017, to then bear raid (artificially deflate) it to potentially $0?

This from an earlier comment:

You force a high stock price on a company that isn't fully running yet and they have to pay back investors who have convertible bonds because they rise with a volatile stock increase.

Then when they pay that large sum, their liquid capital decreases, decreasing profitability and undermining their stock value. Add in terrible, pessimistic attitudes from analysts, and we have the means of bringing down a company through bear raid tactics.

So I think the plan to bring Tesla down via its stock has been planned for a while. Leading me to think there should be a ban again on short selling, to avoid these sinister plots to take happen in the first place.

### Global Consumer Stocks Trending in the News

* **Amazon (AMZN)** shares could be worth $3,000 according to a new report from Piper Jaffray.  Amazon could reach that level in two to three years, which would be a 65% rise from current levels, the report notes.  Amazon could reach this level without any acquisition and at that level its market cap would approach $1.5 trillion.  Amazon is rated “Neutral” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Top Buy” in our US Consumer Discretionary Global Top Stock Ideas.  
* **Casino (ENXTPA:CO)** and parent company **Rallye (ENXTPA:RAL)** were placed under credit protection as both struggle under an enormous debt load.  Credit protection is a feature of French law allowing a company 6 months to present a restructuring plan.  Shares of both were suspended Thursday as the news was published and will resume trading Friday.  Casino is rated “Neutral” in our European SMID-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas.  Rallye is rated “Neutral” in our European SMID-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas
* **Nissan Motor (TSE:7201)** had its credit rating cut by Moody’s.  Nissan’s rating was cut to A3 from A2, with Moody’s cited dropping profit and margins over the last 2 years.  The downgrade comes in the wake of Nissan being placed in credit watch in February.  Nissan is suffering from slumping sales in the US and recently cut its guidance for the year.  Nissan Motor Co. is rated “Top Buy” in our Japan Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas.
* **Tesla (TSLA)** shares continue to slide as the downgrades pile up.  Earlier in the week Morgan Stanley gave a bear case scenario for Tesla that included a $10 price target.  Its previous bear case target was $97.  A number of other brokers have downgraded or written negative comments since, and the stock is down over 7% just this week.  Weak demand, saturated market, insufficient capital and a flood of competing models about to hit the market are among the concerns cited.  Tesla is rated “Unattractive” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Neutral” in our US Consumer Discretionary Global Top Stock Ideas.  
* **Twitter (TWTR)** has banned well-known anti-Trump members Brian and Ed Krassenstein.  Twitter permanently banned both of them, saying they operated fake accounts and paid for fake interactions.  A Twitter spokesman said “Twitter rules apply to everyone” adding that the allegations are grounds for the ban.  Twitter is rated “Neutral” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Attractive” in our US Information Technology Global Top Stock Ideas    
* **Yum! Brands (YUM)** is planning a large expansion of its Taco Bell unit in India as it seeks new avenues of growth.  Taco Bell will add 600 location over the next decade.  Yum Brands has 35 Taco Bells in India today.   The expansion in India will help Taco Bell grow from 7,500 location today to 9,000 by 2022.  Yum Brands is rated “Unattractive” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Top Buy” in our US Consumer Discretionary Global Top Stock Ideas.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Furthermore, the Justice Department recognized that a ruling against Qualcomm could empower China and Huawei, Qualcomm and the U.S.’s main rivals in 5G, which also ultimately harms U.S. consumers.

Here are more reasons why investors shouldn’t worry:

1. While the ruling takes effect immediately, Qualcomm is going to request a stay to halt the process from going forward. Should the stay be denied by Judge Koh, a motion will be filed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which would likely rule within one to two months. Meanwhile, Qualcomm will appeal the merits of the case, which could take another 18 months.

2. Because this ruling undermines U.S. leadership against China in 5G, it isn’t a stretch to expect some kind of intervention from the executive branch during the appeals process. If not an executive order, the DOJ’s battle with the FTC over antitrust enforcement is something to keep an eye on.

3. Qualcomm intellectual property is still the best. Apple settled on the merits of its agreement with Qualcomm, knowing full well that this ruling would have helped its case. It knew no other company could support its ambitions in 5G and mobile technology. Qualcomm’s design wins and contributions to 5G standards are significant, and considering it is still early days for the technology, they have nowhere to go but up. This ruling doesn’t change that.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,358725,public,self,Investors should treat court ruling against Qualcomm as merely a speed bump,0,1559610766,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bsb8r9/investors_should_treat_court_ruling_against/,all_ads,6,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'ZNLxRhDm8Rx8dStFs3DtT9RiL0esez1FmW2UV5-i1QA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dHH_gPyoOf4bj_HJ8S1G1K3uiN4rrHxvC9S_4VIcmnk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc859e2ee877d812c9eb2e96b42771511b2ea228', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dHH_gPyoOf4bj_HJ8S1G1K3uiN4rrHxvC9S_4VIcmnk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36b43db06964d0d0fe10cc7cf346b154a3d6f4d8', 'width': 216}, {'height': 179, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dHH_gPyoOf4bj_HJ8S1G1K3uiN4rrHxvC9S_4VIcmnk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e34305ecb8cbf8965a91c9289171e92a5da93965', 'width': 320}, {'height': 359, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dHH_gPyoOf4bj_HJ8S1G1K3uiN4rrHxvC9S_4VIcmnk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6cf0bb10f21e55eb91532c3900aa884aeee4cc6', 'width': 640}, {'height': 539, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dHH_gPyoOf4bj_HJ8S1G1K3uiN4rrHxvC9S_4VIcmnk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9894aca064af141dddc0871c471bf9fa4590ca9c', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dHH_gPyoOf4bj_HJ8S1G1K3uiN4rrHxvC9S_4VIcmnk.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c41cbcb8e6fcc99a520cb8f805e24e9867b388f8', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 742, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dHH_gPyoOf4bj_HJ8S1G1K3uiN4rrHxvC9S_4VIcmnk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=809d5988bf8db061c1e521cc003acb37cd235126', 'width': 1320}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

The stock been on a steady decline for about three years. It's a ISP. Currently the stock is under $2 and about a year ago they did a reverse 15 to 1 stock split, I believe to keep some of the investors calm... (I think that was what they called it.) With a couple years I expect one of two things to happen to the company: 1) They get bought out by a competitor. OR 2) Bankruptcy. I think option one will happen due to use having a fairly large footprint with some decent infrastructure in some states. I do have money stashed away so hoping to make some money off the dying company if possible.

What I'm curious about is hypothetically, if ATT or Verizon bought the company in a few years is it likely that the stock will go up? For example, if Verizon bought the company would the stock price be the same as Verizons at that point? 2) If that does happen will the reverse stock split still be in play? ie; If I but one of our stock @ $2 and then Verizon buys it and they're at $50, will that turn into $750? ($50\*15)?

&gt;Disney calls the land the company's largest expansion at its parks ever. Its Imagineers are using innovative technology and spare-no-expense design to wrap guests into an experience. There will be a ride that allows guests to fly the Millennium Falcon, shops that allow them to build their own lightsabers, and restaurants that will serve galactic fare like fried Endorian tip-yip — or, as we like to call it, chicken.

Personally, I am a firm believer that we will be seeing the $20,000 level for btc by July 4 and am setting up my own positions to maximize my profits during this imminent run up. First, I have purchased a $5000 two year cloud mining contract with InnovaMine which is returning roughly $110 a day and I will have recouped my entire investment in just 8 more days (45 days total). Shameless plug, check it out, they're great [https://innovamine.io/id/8277](https://innovamine.io/id/8277) . Anyways, I am trying to get to about an 80% BTC 20% XRP split because going forward I feel like Bitcoin and Ripple are the only true contenders. I think we will see $20k this summer for a couple of reasons. Primarily I think now that MACD has crossed over and the bull run is truly on, mainstream media will push to all the copycat investors that wished they were in for round one. I would say at around $10k there will be some serious attention and hype pushing crypto volume to all time highs. Additionally, with tariffs and trade wars and government collapse in nations like Venezuela, I believe that crypto is more appealing now than ever before. The push for decentralization and controlling your own assets is starting to really make sense to a lot of people. Lastly, with the introduction of BAKKT to the market as well as growing acceptance of the crypto field among many of the worlds leading nations; I believe this only further solidifies the establishment of Bitcoin in the market and helps stabilize crypto as a whole from volatile swings. All right lets hear it...debate me down below.

 2. A marketplace is able to gather in one place individual diamond holders, buyers, diamond cutters, jewelers, as well as those involved in the gemstone business. Individual holder will be able to sell diamonds not only to jeweler, but to any interested person across the whole world.  
3. Marketplace can be an excellent option not only for those who want to buy a valuable gift for beloved one at a reasonable price, but also for those who want to open their own online jewelry store. There is no need to make a website, promote it, rent an office or a warehouse. DOM has everything ready. Marketplace opportunities are enough to organize and coordinate small and medium businesses.  
 4. Until now market monopolists evaluate diamonds themselves, trying to get the maximum profit from each client. Markups of jewellery stores turn diamonds into an unreasonably expensive item. Having bought a diamond in such a store, it won't be possible to sell it back for the same amount. The marketplace will gather diamonds from individual owners and sellers who will compete with each other, offering buyers the most attractive prices.  
5. When you buy a diamond in jewelry store or from speculator, the data on the deal is never entered into any database, which can be used in case you want to sell the stone.

He also sees the company's next moves — the new Model Y, the refresh of the Models S and X — as insufficient to bring it back to good.""

### Stocks Trending in the News

### Global Consumer Stocks Trending in the News

* **Avon Products (AVP)** is close to a sale to Brazil’s **Natura (NATU3)**, WSJ is reporting.  The boards of both companies have approved the deal that has been prepared over the past months.  The deal would mark the end of Avon’s independence, one of America’s best known companies over the past decades.  Avon has seen sales suffering and the deal is its best survival option.  Avon Products is not rated in our Global Top Stock Ideas.  Natura is rated “Attractive” in our Brazil All-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas.
* **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** is starting to use loans to drive sales, a more aggressive move for Harley.  Harley will introduce about 100 new models by 2027 and will use loans to drive sales to new customers it anticipates will be younger and less well-off than its stable of aging customers.  The risk for Harley is an uptick in delinquencies that could hamper results.  Harley-Davidson is rated “Attractive” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Neutral” in our US Consumer Discretionary Global Top Stock Ideas.  
* **Lowes (LOW)** cut guidance, raising doubts about its turnaround efforts.  Lowes cut full-year EPS guidance to $5.54 to $5.74, down from previous $6.00 to $6.10.  Lowes said, “The consumer is healthy” and that its plan is in its early stages.  Lowes anticipates cutting next years earnings guidance too.  Lowes is rated “Neutral” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Top Buy” in our US Consumer Discretionary Global Top Stock Ideas.  
* **Nike (NKE)** has called the recently enacted tariffs on Chinese imports “catastrophic” in an open letter to President Trump.  Tariffs on footwear would be part of the next round of tariffs and Nike with 173 other companies pleaded with the President to not act further.  There is much less production of shoes in China than was the case a few years ago, but the companies argue it would still be terrible if fully implemented.  Nike is rated “Neutral” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Top Buy” in our US Consumer Discretionary Global Top Stock Ideas.  

### Global Information Technology Stocks Trending in the News

* **Qualcomm (QCOM)** violated anti-trust law with its business practices, a federal judge has ruled.  Qualcomm used its dominant market position to charge excessive licensing fees.  “Qualcomm’s practices have strangled competition,” the judge wrote in a ruling that agreed with FTC findings.  Qualcomm charges a percentage of the sale price of the phone, a practice the judge found excessive.  Qualcomm is rated “Unattractive” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Neutral” in our US Information Technology Global Top Stock Ideas

### Global Industrials Stocks Trending in the News

* **Boeing’s (BA)** 737 Max crash involving Ethiopian Airlines was likely caused by a bird strike to a suspected sensor, WSJ reports.  The sensor in the Boeing 737 Max in question, part of the MCAS system, does not have a back-up source of information in the event there is a problem with it.  The addition of a back-up is part of the modifications Boeing is testing.  Boeing is rated “Top Short” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Unattractive” in our US Industrials Global Top Stock Ideas.  

### Global Financial Stocks Trending in the News

* **China CITIC Bank (SEHK:998)** and **Baidu (BIDU)** are seeking up to 7 billion yuan in private funding in its first round of funding for its digital bank, aiBank.  China CITIC and Baidu launched the online bank in 2015 and are seeking funding to drive growth.  aiBank provides personal loans of up to 300,000 yuan with no collateral.   China CITIC Bank is rated “Neutral” in our China All-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas.

Citi’s Itay Michaeli sees increasing probability the shares plummet more than 80% to just $36. 

“Maintain sell/high risk as the risk/reward still appears negatively skewed despite the recent capital raise and stock pullback, mainly on lingering demand/FCF (free cash flow) concerns,” wrote the analyst in a note late Tuesday. “Reducing estimates to reflect the recent capital raise, Q1 results/guide and our own inputs.”

The analyst cut his regular price target on Tesla to $191 from $238 by adjusting the probabilities of three scenarios, seeing a decreasing chance of a big rally in the stock and an increasing chance of a share collapse. He sees a 40% chance (up from 35%) of a “full bear” scenario of $36, a 55% chance of a “moderate bull” scenario of $253 and a 5% chance (down from 10%) of a “full bull case” of $760.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,358190,public,self,Another analyst just put out a shocking bear case for Tesla: Citi sees chance stock drops to $36,0,1559598276,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/brnn9b/another_analyst_just_put_out_a_shocking_bear_case/,all_ads,6,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'tGdbgbVfYYGEtkd-OWehHGiENctpY4onIrM8TjqHbaw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iwvcuq4VOW1JJn8H03nvbdpAc-qRLhZq7PGFGzpYrks.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc6a8bc2817bcac68a91873551180c99f3a2c0ad', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iwvcuq4VOW1JJn8H03nvbdpAc-qRLhZq7PGFGzpYrks.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=537862cc368fbd43028c074d28b85394aef427bd', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iwvcuq4VOW1JJn8H03nvbdpAc-qRLhZq7PGFGzpYrks.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce126288269387dc89f8690fcd99d7265e712f89', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iwvcuq4VOW1JJn8H03nvbdpAc-qRLhZq7PGFGzpYrks.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73850eb1fdf46ce95f6bc73fc5a80e249a15f182', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iwvcuq4VOW1JJn8H03nvbdpAc-qRLhZq7PGFGzpYrks.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afe1e7fdde7173c898b6e62bb1aeb959f96b25b2', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iwvcuq4VOW1JJn8H03nvbdpAc-qRLhZq7PGFGzpYrks.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e897cc83ec41c175d4fa41e428f597d37914584d', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2280, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iwvcuq4VOW1JJn8H03nvbdpAc-qRLhZq7PGFGzpYrks.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=84349a79529ecc1d3efc5bf5a9a75c5fd25e6621', 'width': 3419}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

After 9 years of operations they are losing 2 billion per year, and now they want to beg for money in the stock market so they can eventually achieve their grand vision for the future of working

Wework is in the business of coworking office space. According to deskmag.com, coworking is described like this:

**“What makes coworking special? An important precondition of coworking is the exceptional situation of coworkers. They work mostly in self-determined situations: the majority are self-employed freelancers, or entrepreneurs with their employees, as well as an increasing number of employees of large companies”.**

It sounds great, but….it’s been 9 years now. To lose 2 billion dollars in 1 year would be a huge blow to any company. Even Google or Amazon would feel a loss like that. Whats worse is that the concept of coworking hasn’t even been proven or widely accepted yet. We don’t know yet if it is more efficient (its not, common sense goes a long way sometimes). Anybody who has worked by themselves knows very few people can do it efficiently, and this is why the standard template of executive/manager/worker will never go away. Wework is still a unique idea that is worth trying out, but building 41 billion dollars of unique office space based upon this theory is insanity. It’s almost reminiscent of China’s highly inefficient BRI, where cities are built inland far from any water source and [Sri Lanken seaports go virtually unused ](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/inside-chinas-us1-billion-port-in-sri-lanka-where-ships-dont-want-to-stop). It’s all about that long term though right.

Regardless of how inefficient the Chinese are sometimes, they make up for it with their 996 work schedule, and you could only imagine the reaction you’d get if you showed them some of Wework’s office spaces. How is our generation supposed to compete when this is what our idea of work is. Seriously? If this is the case, we are fucked! Better start learning Mandarin sooner rather then later.

The problem with expanding a business before you even know it will work is……………………………..ehm…………………..what if your plan, that incredible all seeing vision of the future was wrong………..Or even better, what if ………things like………I don’t know………………change.

Nobody knows the future, but history is replete with people that thought they did, and the result was always the same. Just because the concept seems like it will work, doesn’t mean it will, and that is why it is usually not smart to go all in at first. Like the saying goes, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and don’t go all in at first, or start small then work your way up, but history will always repeat itself, and the reason why is because human psychology will always stay the same. Some of the greatest minds the world has ever seen have made some of histories greatest mistakes. They will make excuses, or look the other way, or in Weworks case, pretend some expenses don’t actually exist by inventing completely novel and unheard of internal accounting standards.

We have all heard of EBITDA, and some of us have also heard of Adjusted-EBITDA, but have you ever heard of “Community-Adjusted-EBITDA”? Nobody has. Why? Because WeWork made it up! Not only are they innovating the world of working, but also accounting!! Genius! When you have no cash, just pretend you do and everything will be okay!

I guess General and Administrative Expense, a fundamental part of any normal business, just doesn’t count…I mean counting that would conflict with their core community vision right? Take a look at this video.

[https://www.bitchute.com/video/d2OcUen5pFTp/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/d2OcUen5pFTp/)

A normal business would cut growth to generate cash, or maybe even sell some assets, but because Wework is so devoted to their grand vision, and so sure it will work, doing this would be counter productive in their eyes. I mean, I guess you can understand their logic from that angle. If you know it is going to work, just find the money somewhere else, then wait for this inevitable growth to flatten out those wrinkles……..eventually…..someday……..it will work. It’s only 41 billion. Think of the market they are tapping. Everybody works, so the possibilities are almost limitless!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

It makes no difference to me if Uber succeeds or fails, I’m not a stakeholder of the company. I’ve never shorted a stock due to high risks but Uber almost seems too perfect not to do so. Below are my reasons for shorting Uber, please let me know if I’m missing anything.

1) Declining revenue growth rate
Revenue growth fell from 106% in 2017 to 42% in 2018. Q4 revenue was a mere 2% higher than Q3. 

2) Unprofitability in ride-hailing
Take rate declines from 22% in Q1 to 18% in Q4 (2018) Drivers are already going on strike, increasing take rate doesn’t seem like an option.  They could increase prices but customers will find alternatives and hence they lose market share. 

3) UberEats isn’t the top food delivery business by market share in the US, Doordash is. Doordash is also growing at a quicker rate. Amazon recently invested half a billion in Deliveroo, which is a big player in the UK and the EU.

4) No economic moat
What’s fundamentally wrong about all of Uber’s businesses is that anyone can do them given enough funding. Market share is bought with infinite expenditure like promotions, subsidies, discounts and marketing. These fake gains last only as long as cash is being burnt funding these expenditures. 

5) Not the leader in autonomous vehicles 
Toyota among other companies have funded Uber’s self driving unit. Toyota, a company that hasn’t produced a full electric vehicle. In no particular order, companies like Waymo (partnered with Lyft), GM and Tesla are the leaders in AV tech. These companies have the power to produce fleets of EVs and Tesla EVs already have the hardware required for OTA FSD software upgrades when Tesla does achieve FSD. Where are Uber’s factories? They are 3-5 years behind in my opinion.

6) Weak bull case 
I’ve been hearing Bulls use the words ‘network effect’ over and over again, citing Uber’s huge global platform. The reality is 70% of on-demand Drivers in the US drive for both Lyft and Uber. I’ll bet a much higher percentage of customers use both Lyft and Uber, not doing so would be outright financially irresponsible. It doesn’t even take 20 seconds to check which are offering better discounts for the day. If the network effect is so strong, Uber wouldn’t have sold it’s market share to Grab in SEA, Yandex in Russia and Didi in China. There is no customer loyalty when it comes to rideshare apps. Bulls tend to shift focus to Uber’s more potentially profitable businesses like Eats and Freight as though Uber’s valuation isn’t entirely based off the fact that it has the biggest rideshare platform. However successful Eats and Freight might be in the future, Uber stock will be due for a big correction if rideshare proofs to never be profitable. 

7) Business model attracts lawsuits
Disrupting the highly regulated cab industry has brought Uber tons of lawsuits. Uber is facing a class action lawsuit in Australia. It’s lack of background checks in hiring drivers and attitude of taking no responsibility for customer well-being is causing itself to be sued left, right and center.

8) Losses 
No company has ever lost so much money and yet be further away from profitability like Uber. The company openly admits to the possibility of never being profitable. 4.5b operating loss in 2017, 3b in 2018. When asked if 2019 will mark a record year of losses for Uber, CEO Dara replied “That is the intent”. Not to be taken out of context, he certainly means record losses incurred trying to gain the most market share but it also means that if Uber does not show better than expected revenue gains, its stock is finished.

For a company with no clear path to profitability, has a long-term debt of $8b, slowing revenue growth, how is the stock trading at 7x revenue? I think we would really see a huge correction if Uber reports a decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1. If you’re bullish on rideshare, choose Lyft (which I don’t have a position in), Lyft has no long term debt and they are partnered with Waymo for AVs.

Disclaimer: I currently hold a position in HUYA


**HUYA**

HUYA is currently in a rising market, and their numbers show. The eSport/Gaming market is currently in its infant stage and I would label it as a 'hyper market'. Growth like this is crazy and revenues in this industry are likely to double in just a few years from now.

HUYA is also (in my opinion) a realistic company in terms of goals. They know they can't take on Twitch in the US or Europe right now, and they won't until they perfect their product. In a recent [interview with the CEO](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/05/20/nyse-listed-huya-is-working-on-its-strategy-in-asia-latam-and-africa-before-entering-the-us-says-ceo.html) he states that they will focus on Asia, LATAM, and Africa.

I live in Asia and I am from a European background and I know that HUYA will have a much better cultural connection to the Asian people than ever Twitch will. Culture is so important here and you might be wondering how that would influence a platform like this but there are so many reasons, and I suspect that HUYA can become the stronger platform in this region in the coming years.

- China Regulations on Gaming

These regulations will hurt the smaller developers more than the big ones, and most eSports games are run by big companies. Devs will need licenses to release new games, this will hinder a ton of games from releasing but it doesn't affect existing games, and the larger companies will probably not experience much difficulty here as the licensing will be done in advance to avoid delays. This also only affects China, which is currently a big portion of their userbase but they are already expanding in other regions, and the amount of gaming that takes place in Asia is unfathomable. Almost every person I see here on the subway is playing some form of game, guys mostly play competitive games like some kind of mobile league of legends, while females tend to play puzzlers/match-3 games.


- Trump &amp; trade war

I don't see any relationship between HUYA and the trade war. Their core business should be totally uneffected by this, yet it is the main reason it's dropping.


- Debt

HUYA has no long term debt but they did recently raise money


- 5G

The development of 5G could have a huge impact on them. More people will be able to stream on the go and it will open a bunch of new possibilities for HUYA.

2) Since there are a few law firms, does the court lump all the filings as one and deal with it as one?
