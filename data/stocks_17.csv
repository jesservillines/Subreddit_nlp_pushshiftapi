I just got the app Robinhood. I've never traded stock before, however I've saved up several thousand dollars from a good job I started last year and want to start investing it. I have a 401k with Vanguard *(my only exposure to stocks in any way)* and would like to try my hand at buying stocks on my own. This is money I put aside for this purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to research and learn about investing so I won't be emotional about it. I'm trying to avoid getting sucked into FOMO *(Fear Of Missing Out)*.  I'm open to any resources/links that you guys would think are helpful. Of course personal experience of what you learned and a smart way to start off would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Mainly I think I need to understand: 

* What to look for when choosing a stock
* The basic terms that are important to understand
* What schemes to avoid
* What sources to read to learn about specific stocks
* Anything else that I'm too new to know is important

So about a year ago I made a couple of stock purchases, I bought

SHOP (Shopify) at $121/share and it is now trading at $242/share

TTD (The Trade Desk) at $74/share and it is now trading at $219/share

When I made these trades these two stocks made up about 20% of my portfolio. However their tremendous performances compared to the rest of my stocks/ETFs have made it so they now make up 52% of my brokerage account.

They've done so well for me it is hard to sell out of the FOMO of more gains but it does seem dangerous to have so much of my money tied up in a particular industry.

Would it be incredibly stupid to not sell off half my shares and put that into other industries or should I ride the wave and hope for more gains?

Any insight/advice is greatly appreciated, thanks.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,350128,public,,self,E-Commerce has unintentionally become over 50% of my portfolio.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

The reason I think that Google Inc is one of the top investing opportunities today over the long-term is that their internet search business is well entrenched and profitable, YouTube continues to grow, and their services truly offer value. 

Ever try to navigate without google maps? 

Ever try to search using Bing and not Google? 

Ever look on YouTube how to fix your projector bulb, replace a broken part, build a website, get quick inspiration, cook a new recipe, fix something in your house, check product reviews, learn proper weight lighting technique, the list goes on.. 

Google will continue to dominate because they truly offer value. Not only that, Google is continuing to invest in the future. Google has been buying up robotics companies for example and pouring money into Research and Development. Don't believe me? See for yourself, here is their Capital Spending as % of their Revenue, 19.5% in 2018. I use Morningstar typically for quick research: [Google Capex as % Revenue](https://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=0P000002HD&amp;culture=en&amp;platform=sal) 

Google also has an Operating Margin of 23%, a Return on Invested Capital of 17%, and Free Cash Flow as % Revenue is 16%. In the [MKEInvestmentClub](https://mkeinvestmentclub.com/) newsletter, a monthly newsletter with live buy and sell alert service that I co-own, we typically look for above 10% in the three metrics listed above. This helps us avoid investment catastrophes which kill your overall return.  

The second company I would recommend you take a deeper look into is TREX. We own this in our newsletter service. TREX is a fantastic play especially in the decking space. They have a huge market potential as 90% of decks are traditional wood and TREX has a wooden-alternative product which has significant cost advantages over the long-term. TREX has over 50% market share in the composite decking market. 

TREX is a no brainer. A disruptive top of the line product with stellar [financials](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/trex/quote.html). Operating margin 26%, Return on Invested Capital 47%, Free Cash Flow as % Revenue of 15%.   


Here is a link to their [investor presentation in March 2019](https://trexcompanyinc.gcs-web.com/static-files/6443af8d-686e-43ab-a0ba-5da11e83229b). Keep in mind that any investor relations page has one goal, get you to buy their stock - so always read with skepticism. That being said, I think the strategy make sense and we own a piece in our growth portfolio. They've done very well for us! 

The last time TREX dropped on earnings they jumped rapidly afterwards. I don't believe this scenario will play out exactly as before, but the numbers suggest TREX remains a long-term buy. 

Long story short, GOOGL and TREX will do well in the long run. If not you can return to this post and down vote me! : )

I know fundamentally, buying calls = predict stock price increase. Buying put = predict decrease.

So it makes intuitive sense that when buying a call, you would choose an option where the strike price is higher than the current stock price (since u are predicting it will go up). And vice versa for buying puts. You would choose a put option where the strike price is below the current market price of the stock.

So i dont understand being able to buy, for example, puts at a strike price ABOVE the current market price. Isn't that saying u are predicting the stock to go up?

Disney, though currently on a hot streak, is still severely undervalued and there is plenty of runway for them to grow.  With a market cap that is sitting at $250B, I have no question that this stock is going to break out in the short-term with many of the recent, but not new, revelations about this beloved company.  My investment thesis for this stock can be broken down into the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Core competency and extendable core:  Disney's core competency is its marketing ability.  Everything they touch becomes more valuable because they are able to create a complex network of their properties.  Let's take their fairly recent Marvel aquisition (this is an easy one to analyze).  You start off with a series of individual solid movies, all tied together and packaged neatly in a box titled Avengers.  The movies are all hits, bringing in revenues that are small fries compared to the merchandise that are sold such as clothing, toys, movies.  Their marketing has done so well that anything that bears the Disney or Marvel logo is synonymous with quality.  This combined with their economies of scale allows them to produce top notch content at a steep discount.  They were able to film both Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame with a liberal estimate of &lt;800 million dollars.  Just ticket sales alone generated over 1.2B in revenue in just one weekend.  Not only that, but their abilities to create complex and high return webs is highly extendable.  I mean they own Star Wars.  I think they butchered the new movies, but that franchise is a cash cow.  It is almost criminally obvious that Disney is currently priced based on fundamental analysis instead of technical analysis.  That being said, a market cap of $250B is ridiculous which brings me to my next point.
2. Comparables: Now before I begin on this point, Disney does not have any close comparables.  However, for arguments sake, let's take their biggest competitor, Netflix.  NFLX is sitting on a market cap of about $160B (on the conservative side).  That means that Disney, with all of its intellectual property, an upcoming competitive streaming service, high marketing potential, and positive cash flow is only worth \~50% more than Netflix, a company dishing out money to maintain their streaming service and generate new content.  This means one of two things.  Either Netflix is overvalued or Disney is undervalued.  The likelihood is a combination of both.  It is already public information that Disney will be pulling all of its content from Netflix and releasing it on the highly anticipated Disney+.  I have yet to find the statistic on it, but I am confident that at least 20% of Netflix streaming hours are on Disney content.  You can bet that at a price point of $6.99 a month, Disney will be making money hand over fist with their new subscription service.  This brings us to number 3.
3. Streaming:  To those who believe that Disney is late to the shootout, I do not mean to come off as rude, but that most likely means you do not understand the tides of the digital revolution.  Streaming is still in its infancy.  That would be like saying Facebook was late to social media because Myspace occupied the space.  God bless Netflix for paving the road, but now Disney is laying out the tracks.  This is the central point of my thesis:  Disney has not only found a way to create a subscription service for their wealth of content, they have done something much more important.  They have found a way to cripple their greatest competition while helping them build the framework.  Disney has been planning a streaming service for YEARS.  Why would they keep feeding Netflix their content if they were afraid of Netflix's user base.  It's because Disney was using Netflix as a testing ground.  Along with the dues Netflix pays to Disney, Disney also gets big data.  How many people are watching their shows/movies?  How many hours do people spend on their content?  They finally found the levels high enough to justify their own service.  They let Netflix do the legwork and Disney got paid for it.  Netflix NEEDS (needed) Disney.  Disney never needed Netflix.  In short, Netflix was a vessel to offset cost and test the streaming waters before Disney jumps in.
4.  Intangibles:  Disney is not a company you buy off its current financials.  Of course they're going to have high capital expenditures.  It is part of the network they are building that I mentioned in point 1.  When you see Mickey Mouse, when you see any Avenger, when you see any Star Wars character, you are seeing intangible assets that can not be priced on a financial statement.  I would argue that Marvel, Lucas Films, and Disney are worth more than a measly $250B.

I have more that I can discuss, but these four points are the reason I placed an order today for 300 more shares of Disney at an average cost of $140.  Disney is at an all time high, but an investment at any level now will see returns in the double digits within the next year.  I am giving Disney a conservative market cap of $300B to at least put them near twice the worth of Netflix.  This would bring their stock to roughly $168 for a modest 20% gain.  Please feel free to share your thoughts as I have spent a lot of timing developing my thesis on this company.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,349686,public,,self,Thesis for Disney Long,0.0,1556640776,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/birb34/thesis_for_disney_long/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

Once i learned about what shorting was, i came upon what options were.

After about 2-3ish hours of reading and watching videos, i am still not 100% ""getting it."" And I keep getting specific questions about the particulars.

So i understand that options are derivatives. simply because its price derives from the stock. (or something similar to that)
and that options are basically contracts.

these contracts can be either a ""call"", or a ""put"". if a buyer buys a call, they are locking in price X for stock Y, in hopes that the stock price **increases** past X, which is the ""strike price. And if it does, new price - x is the profit margin, since they can buy the stock at the strike price they had the contract for, and sell it at the new high price.

if a buyer buys a put, they are locking in price X for stock Y, in hopes that the stock price **decreases** past X, (the strike price), Since basically, they can buy stocks at the new low price, and exercise their option to sell those stocks at their contract strike price. (or just sell the option to avoid the extra step)

i somewhat understand these concepts. but what confuses me are the particulars about it. I dont know how to phrase these questions, or what order to put them in, so ill just put them in numbered form.

1. if there is an options buyer (or holder) there is always a seller (or writer) correct? is this the same concept as if someone wanted to buy something at the grocery store? if there is no seller of the specific type of option you want, you simply cant buy it?

2. if 1 is true, are all the options shown on RH ones that are already on the market/made by a writer?

3. in buying options, why are there choices to buy a call for lower the current stock price, and on the flip side, buy a put for higher than the current stock price? if by definition, buying a call means you predict stock go to up, buying put means you predict it to go down. what makes this even more confusing is that the premium simply forces you to have a break even point higher than the current stock price anyways.

4. i cant seem to understand options in the sellers perspective. if ""buying a call = predicting stock to go up"" by definition is the opposite true? Selling a call = predicting stock to go **Down**? (as well as buying a put = predict stock to go down, so selling a put = stock to go up?)

5. Am i understanding correctly that buying options keep your risk defined (just the premium paid) and reward (theoretically) unlimited, while SELLING options is the reverse? keeps your reward defined (the premium) and risk unlimited?

I have more specific questions but i cant seem to remember them at this time.

Good morning and happy Sunday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead this week.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 29th, 2019.

# **Investors brace for a roller-coaster week ahead with Fed decision and Apple, Alphabet earnings - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/investors-brace-for-a-roller-coaster-week-ahead-with-fed-decision-and-apple-alphabet-earnings.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize the Fed will continue to be patient and hold back from raising interest rates, but there is a risk the Fed could inject some volatility into markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, in a week heavy with earnings news and some key economic reports. Friday’s employment report tops the list of data releases, but there is also PCE inflation Monday and monthly vehicle sales Wednesday. There are more than 150 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, including Apple, Alphabet and drug majors Merck and Pfizer.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think the Fed is going to signal any big change in its policy stance next week. If anything, they will talk about how the economy is showing signs of improvement and therefore, it is appropriate to remain patient and see how things evolve,” said Mark Cabana, head of short U.S. rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
*****
&gt; Fed officials are sure to discuss Friday’s surprisingly strong report of 3.2% economic growth in the first quarter, much better than the 2.5% pace expected by economists. It is also far better than the flattish growth forecasts and recession fears that cropped up during the first quarter when data looked spotty and the government was closed for five weeks.
*****
&gt; “I’m sure it’s going to heat up the internal debate on what the direction of policy should be,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. Economists expect the Fed to retain its dovish tone even with the better U.S. data because uncertainty remains about global growth, particularly from Europe.
*****
&gt; But some stock traders have been concerned with stocks near record highs, that the Fed may not want to sound quite as dovish, as it did after its January and March meetings when it ‘pivoted’ its policy to remove rate hikes from the forecast this year.
*****
&gt; “There’s some scope for disappointment there,” said Cabana.
*****
&gt; But then the Fed, and markets, have focused on the lack of inflation and the fact that will keep the Fed in an easier policy stance. Some market pros are counting on interest rate cuts, before the Fed ever hikes rates again.
*****
&gt; The Fed has targeted a 2% inflation rate. Core PCE inflation for the first quarter fell to a 1.7% pace, year over year, from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. March inflation data is released on Monday.
*****
&gt; “Our view has been and continues to be that the constant undershooting of core PCE that was again confirmed today is something that has the Fed perplexed, which is central to our theses that the Fed is going to cut rates later this year,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. He expects the Fed to cut interest rates in both September and December.
*****
&gt; Emanuel also pointed out that first quarter GDP contained some transitory factors like a positive impact from trade and inventories that are not recurring, and inventories could even detract from second quarter growth. But some economists expect consumers to become a stronger force in the second quarter and make up for some of that.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he expects the S&amp;P 500, which surpassed its previous closing high of 2,930, in the past week, to reach a high of 3,000 this year. The S&amp;P is up more than 3% in April so far, and earnings season has been mostly positive for stocks.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.2% in the past week, closing Friday at 2,939, just under its all-time intra-day high of 2,940, from Sept. 21. The Nasdaq was up 1.9% for the week at a new closing high of 8,146. But the Dow was down 0.1% for the week, ending at 26,543, still 1.5% below its intra-day high.
*****
&gt; Big earnings week
&gt; The first quarter earnings season was expected to be the first negative quarter for profit growth in three years, but as of Friday, earnings growth looks to be flattish, based on actual numbers for companies that have already reported and estimates for others, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; According to Emanuel, the coming week’s earnings will be important, and now there are reports from big pharma. He said health care has become more attractive to him as it has come under pressure this year.
*****
&gt; “If you look at the rebound, that is only four months old, the easy money has been made and the easy money has been made in technology,” he said. “From our point of view, we like the places investors have had a more difficult time.” He said two of those sectors are health care and financials.
*****
&gt; “With regard to technology there has been an element of performance chase that has crept into the market,” he said.
*****
&gt; Technology, since the start of the year, has been the best performing of the major S&amp;P sectors, with a gain of 26%. Financials are up 18.4%, and health care is the worst performing sector, up just 2.5%
*****
&gt; “If you think about part of the reason the health care sector has been under such intense pressure recently, it is the expectation that legislatively, not only are prices rising less, but you could also have an element of deflation in that sector. Our view point is that is not likely to materialize,” Emanuel said. “We see the weakness in healthcare as much more a function of the majority of the universe is frightened by Medicare for all, and those that aren’t are frightened by the prospect of the Affordable Care Act being repealed. We don’t see either of those happening.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he’s currently being selective in buying stocks, especially given risks to the market like unresolved trade talks between the U.S. and China; the slowdown in Chinese stimulus and weaker growth, particularly in Europe.

# Typical May Trading: Just a Couple of Positive Areas

&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s eighteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# Its Official – Happy 10th Birthday Bull Market

&gt; Yesterday’s new all-time closing high by S&amp;P 500 finally made it official. The current bull market is now in its eleventh year and is the second longest since 1949 and second best by performance with a 333.6% gain from its March 9, 2009 low through its closing high. Since 1949, the longest bull market lived over twelves years from December 1987 to March 2000 and gained 582.1%. Thus far the current bull has endured five corrections ranging from 10.2% to 19.8%. Tame inflation, a dovish Fed and the prospects for continued earnings growth suggest this bull is likely to continue.

# End of the Best Six Months. Should You Sell in May?

&gt; It’s hard for us not to be associated with “Sell in May” and we welcome the opportunity it provides to discuss seasonality and share our analysis and our evidence-based, time-tested and historically-proven “Best Six Months Switching Strategy.” First of all we do not simply Sell in May and go away. And we don’t sell anything until we get a technical confirmation from our MACD Seasonal Sell Signal. When we do get that MACD Sell Signal we will sell some positions in our Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy Portfolio and pick up some bond positions as well as other portfolio maneuvers.

&gt; Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the “Worst Six Months” of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach we take in the Almanac InvestorStock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely “sell in May and go away.” Instead we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated record of outperforming during the period.

&gt; For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the “Worst Months” are a great opportunity to unwind longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the “Worst Six Months” are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities in recent years and could do the same again this year.

&gt; Sure the market got slammed in the first two months (November-December) of the Best Six Months in 2018, nothing’s perfect. It happens. We stuck it out, did not panic at the December 24 low and road the recovery rally. The history of the Best Six/Worst Six Months is undeniable and it still works. There have been off periods throughout its history. The full history is on our website and in the Almanac. But here are a couple of graphs to illustrate.

# Next Bump in Pre-Election Year Rally Could Arise in May

&gt; As of today’s close, DJIA is up 13.6% year-to-date as of today’s close. S&amp;P 500 is up 16.0% and NASDAQ is at 20.8%. Compared to average pre-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past pre-election year average performance for this point of the year. Aside from a brief excursion on the second trading day of the year, 2019 has largely tracked pre-election year historical performance and then some. Should this trend continue, then the next area of concern is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates. However, should late May weakness materialize, it could prove to be a fair entry point as the market usually rallies through June to mid-July.

# B.I.G. Tips - Early Earnings Season Analysis

&gt; More than 500 stocks have reported their first quarter numbers so far this earnings season, which gives us a pretty large sample size to start analyzing overall trends. Through today, 67% of stocks that have reported this season have beaten bottom-line consensus EPS estimates. That's a strong reading relative to the historical average of roughly 60% going back to 1999 (first chart below).

&gt; While the bottom line beat rate is strong, the top line has so far been lacking. As shown in the second chart below, only 53.6% of companies have managed to report stronger than expected revenues this season. This is definitely a concern now that we're already about a quarter of the way through the reporting period. We would note, though, that last season we saw a similar trend as the top-line beat rate started very low before rebounding by the end of the reporting period and actually showing a sequential increase.

&gt; On another note, we've seen an interesting shift in guidance compared to the last two quarters. We're also seeing some negative signs when it comes to how stock prices are reacting to earnings reports.

# 10 Observations on New Highs

&gt; We wrote about the new record high for the S&amp;P 500 Index Wednesday . This is such a big market event we wanted to share some additional thoughts—10 of them in fact—on this market milestone:

&gt; The new high secured March 9, 2019, as the 10th anniversary of the bull market. If the S&amp;P 500 hadn’t made a new high before the next bear market, this bull would have ended short of the 10-year mark.

&gt; Don’t fear new highs. Historically, buying stocks at all-time highs has been productive over the long term, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Going back to 1950, the average 12-month gain from a new high for the S&amp;P 500 has been 9.8%, excluding dividends.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dont-fear-record-highs.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; When new highs have been more than six months apart, as the last two were, average gains in the S&amp;P 500 historically have been about 12% in the 12 months after the new record.

&gt; For those worried that a new high means sub-par long-term returns, consider that the average 5-year annualized gain in the S&amp;P 500 from all-time highs is 9%. For 10 years, it’s a still solid 7.4% (excluding dividends).

&gt; History has shown stocks’ strong start to the year could mean further gains down the road. The average rest-of-year gain for the S&amp;P 500 after a double-digit first quarter rally has been 6%.

&gt; Global growth is supportive. Owning stocks when economic conditions are improving, as they are in the United States and China in particular, tends to be rewarding.

&gt; We don’t think stocks are overvalued. The S&amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (PE) based on consensus analysts’ estimates for the next 12 months is 16.7, very reasonable considering low interest rates and inflation.

&gt; Not all the possible good news is priced in. Investors may get more than they expect out of the U.S.-China trade deal, which could boost business confidence and capital investment.
Earnings may be a positive catalyst. First-quarter earnings season is off to a good start overall, and we think 2019 expectations are too low.

&gt; Sentiment is not overly bullish. Just 33.5% of individual investors are bullish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors. Other sentiment measures we follow are far from euphoric.

&gt; Looking ahead, we believe there are enough potential positive catalysts to propel the S&amp;P 500 to our year-end fair value target of 3,000 this year. At the same time, we acknowledge the risks, particularly overseas—Europe faces structural challenges, lackluster growth, and upcoming Brexit hurdles. The possibility of a pickup in volatility against a favorable fundamental backdrop supports our recommended market weight equities allocation.

# The Waiting Game for Record Highs

&gt; The wait is over.

&gt; After more than seven months, the S&amp;P 500 Index notched a fresh all-time closing high of 2,933.68 on April 23. To get here, investors have weathered back-and-forth in trade negotiations, a historic government shutdown, unrelenting Brexit headlines, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) U-turn in policy, and signs of a global slowdown.

&gt; Fortunately, U.S. stocks have powered through record highs after a prolonged dry spell. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed an average of 12.9% in the 12 months after snapping at least 6-month long record high drought, based on data since 1950.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Climbing-the-wall-of-worry-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “It has been a long time since the S&amp;P 500 scored a new high, yet this could actually hint at future gains,” said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The waiting game for record highs may be tough, but it has proven the durability of this bull market based on sound fundamentals.”

&gt; Stocks’ rapid rebound this year has been impressive, especially 10 years into the current bull market. The S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 20% from the December lows amid the Fed’s pause in rate hikes, progress in trade talks, and an uptick in economic data after a soft beginning to 2019.

&gt; Historically, when U.S. stocks have gone six months without a record, investors have had to contend with a significantly longer waiting period (and more market volatility). The benchmark has taken an average of 25 months to post new highs in times it hasn’t hit a record within six months.

&gt; We’ve maintained that the late-2018 sell-off was overdone, and we see a compelling case for equities near these levels based on sound economic fundamentals. However, the recovery has been arguably a bit fast considering some of the reasons for the decline have yet to be resolved. We think the S&amp;P 500 could eventually move higher and make a run at our 3,000 fair value target, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see volatility pick up over the next few months.

You can see that CIBC World Markets owned 5 millions call options in their 3rd quarter 13-F. There is only 8 million shares available and more then 1/2 is owned by the insiders. The stock went up 600% on no news or developments. I suspect the insiders loaned the stock to a non affiliate, who then engaged in some kind of derivative swap with CIBC to somehow profit on its increase without actually delivering the stock to CIBC. The 5 million call options also had no strike price. Out of the dozens of options CIBC had in their portfolio, NFEC was the only one without a strike. There is just a question mark where there should be a price   
 

 I think I've figured out what happened. CIBC reports owning call options, but I think this is because there was an option swap agreement. On the date of the agreement, the insider (or an affiliate of the insider) bought put options, and CIBC went short. In order to hedge the short sale, CIBC purchased a call option from the insider to net any potential increase in the price. The insider intended to short, so when the price declined, they could (theoretically) sell the stock to CIBC then buy it back immediately and profit off the difference.   


To avoid actually trading the stock, CIBC performs the trade, so when the price fell, CIBC just covers the short, then gives the insider the profit subtracting the strike premium the insider pays for the option.

This way you can sell the stock at the premium that people will pay for the dividend, and buy it when the price is lower because it‘s trading without that dividend. This is similar to a dividend reinvesting approach, however reinvesting the dividends in a stock requires a lot of capital be invested into the stock, if you want to buy more shares with the dividends. Also you usually get the dividends months after the ex-dividend date, so this is a quicker and more direct way to achieve a similar effect that focuses purely on capital gains, and can be executed with smaller amounts of capital. It’s kind of a reverse dividend capture. I haven’t seen this idea anywhere.

On a side note, William O'Neil's classic system forecasting a market correction is showing  4-5 distribution/stall days in 25 trading sessions, which is usually a signal to start exiting the market. The market is also forming a double top pattern.  Also, Dalio said last year that he expected a ranging market for 2019.   We shall see.

First, it is important to note they have a few similarities. Both funds are comprised of multiple different assets and they represent a way for investors to diversify to combat risk. Essentially, it is like investing in a basket of investments. There are also key differences between the funds in terms of how they are managed, how they are traded, how each one is purchased, and how pricing works.

For starters, ETFs can be traded like common stocks. When you think about day to day trading, you can think of ETFs too in terms of buying and selling. Mutual funds on the other hand can only be purchased at the end of each trading day based on their price. 

The way each type of fund is managed differs as well. When you think of mutual funds, these are more actively managed. Many times, analysts are brought in for expert decisions on stock trades. Or mutual funds may have economists come in and make suggestions. Obviously, there is a cost involved, so mutual funds are typically more expensive. ETFs are managed more passively and are based more on a market index.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

1. Intel earnings show clearly some weakness. Numbers do not lie. AMD took alot from them outselling on comsumers market 2-1. Amazon, Microsoft, Google etc. has increase AMD offering in Datacenter.
2. READ Intel SEC filings. They wrote AMD is a Threat. Their last CEO said its his job to keep AMD under 20 % (current 5 % i predict 10 % already and 25-35 % by end of year).
3. Intel somehow thinking that they can buy time and still tell us that 10nm is coming and on schedule. Its like telling you that star citizen will be realease soon. Its just a fake PR stunt. Low volume and nothing for show.
4. Intel Can not compete until 2022! 
5. AMD will be able to produce and out price Intel. Intel will keep priced and not lower much since they lose profit and  margins. But you can only for so long fool people. Companies also thinking alot about their cost and saving money from AMD is no brainer.
6. Notice all the AMD notebook. Super computers wins. And more cloud offerings from the cloud providers. Intel manage to ""fake news"" they cant meet demand is very fake news. They made so many bad decisions and do not know what to do. All over the place.

Mostafa Maklad, 35, is already nostalgic about the good old days of driving for Uber. Five years ago, snaking across the freeways and suburban streets of Los Angeles he estimates he made roughly $50 an hour working 40 hours a week. Now, that figure is around $26 an hour and he works about 75 hours. Much of that money goes back home to his family in Egypt. Then three years ago, he says he was forced to downsize his living conditions in part due to the financial strain. While he once had his own room, he now lives with two others in one bedroom. Having completed 9,000 rides for Uber, Maklad is eligible for a $500 bonus when Uber, which recently filed a prospectus for its IPO, goes public. And while these bonuses, which go up to as much as $10,000, are meant as a nod to drivers who have complained about pay, it’s done little to address their concerns.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,348124,public,,self,Why Not Us?

I understand how a reverse stock split (r/s) works - reduction of share quantity, increase in security value. To my understanding, it is basically an accounting trick. 

I am following a stock that announced they will be doing a r/s in order to regain NASDQ compliance. I have seen numerous posts that advise to sell shares prior to the r/s and buy back in afterwards. Many of these posts state that OP has long-term faith in the company.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: What would be a negative of holding shares through a r/s if equity doesn't change, and I have faith in the company long term? I know I want to bag hold for a few years, but would it be in my best interest to sell prior and buy back in? If so, please explain why.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Thanks in advance for any response/insights. I've asked this question in a few threads, but have yet to receive a response that explains the negatives of holding through.\*\*",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,348056,public,,self,Question regarding the impact of a Reverse Stock Split,,1556286672,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bh8gdb/question_regarding_the_impact_of_a_reverse_stock/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

* **Deutsche Bank (DB:DBK)** and **Commerzbank (DB:CBK)** have formally ended their merger talks.  Five weeks of talks could not yield a deal.  A host of economic and political concerns limited Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank from creating the national powerhouse the German Finance Ministry was pushing for.  Deutsche now must come up with its fifth turnaround plan since 2015 in the wake of the failed merger attempt.   In the end, the 2 banks simply agreed a merger would be too difficult.  Deutsche Bank is rated “Neutral” in our European Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas.  Commerzbank is rated “Unattractive” in our European Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas.

So where will the ""crash"" come from? I think itll come when people have to liquidate their positions out of need to cover their expenses. To me this makea sense with the growing debt and growing student debt. Essentially people just have less disposable income due to debts and the rest of the boring cycle follows - less spending, layoffs, less spending, price drops blah blah blah.

Are there bubbles, sure. However I think they exist more on the private side than those coming to market. When venture capital disappears and a company is not profitable, either they go public or they bust eventually. If a large number busts, there you have the layoffs and blah blah.

As for the catalyst, I feel like itll be during the next election when policies change.

This doesn't make sense as this particular company wasn't even founded until 2010. What is this extra data? Do stock tickers get re-used and this is data from another company? Or is it just a complete error?

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at Yahoo finance data, they also show data going a few months before the company's IPO, although nothing before 2018.

First and foremost, this is all my opinion. I don't want this to turn into a bull/bear crucification. It'll probably turn into that at some point but my hopes are that we can see each others perspectives on the market and whether or not a majority people agree with me or not.

Background - I am 27 years old. I have been actively trading since 2013. My dad worked on WallStreet for close to 30 years as both a broker and trader. I have learned from his trading styles and perspectives and combined them with that of McAllen, Buffet, Graham, etc. I actively day trade (if the opportunity is right) but more look for long term growth stocks (current portfolio is achieving 28% YoY). I won't go into the successes and failures of previous traders as that is not the topic at hand, but am more than happy to discuss those with anyone who wants me to further explain.

Real Estate - This past weekend, I met up with an old colleague who now works in commercial real estate. He runs a multi-million dollar business in one of the banking capitals of the US. He recently informed me that almost every large real estate mogul in the area is selling. Cashing out and liquidating on all property investments. This did not come as a surprise to me as I have thought, especially for the past 6 months, that the real estate market has reformed the inevitable popping bubble. But I did find it interesting given the current temperature of the political environment and the S&amp;P500 and DJIA reaching all time highs. You know what they say - what goes up must come down. And we haven't had a true recession in 10 years (As of June '09 statistically speaking).

Market - I typed this segment multiple times over but honestly could not pinpoint the exact reasoning I am trying to convey. The market just feels topped out right now. As mentioned above, we are reaching all time highs across most markets and also experiencing an amazing bounce back from December when we saw the small dip/correction (which is already far surpassed). However, that December correction still lingers in the current marketplace as investors are more hesitant to hold companies and truly invest. I have noticed more price inconsistency than in previous years and it leads me to believe that not many people are keeping money in for the long haul. It really goes back to Graham's thoughts on speculation vs investing. They have really fused into the same thing, now more than ever. And that creates danger for both investors and companies alike.

Im 45 days into the stock market so im pretty new. Im interested in long term investment and really focused on a portfolio weighted heavily in dividends. I want to play the market relatively safe, so if i could get some feedback on my portfolio that would be great.

SPHD - 12%

NOBL - 7%

INTL - 4%

GAIN - 3%

IEP - 16% (reducing this position over time to fall between 3-6% of my portfolio)

MORL - 3%

STOR - 3%

My idea is to have 50% of my investment in a few different ETF's such as VOO, NOBL,or SPHD then the other 50% of my investment split between 9 or 10 stocks that i believe will either grow in value or pay a decent dividend.

I have a budget of around $500 and I will be buying my stocks using e-trade (this is important for fees and commissions). The home depot looks like a great stock and is really constant but I'm not really sure if there are stocks with better profit out there. With the home depot, u get around a 19% yearly profit btw. I've also been looking into some airlines. The airline stocks look like they go highest during Christmastime and a bit after school summer break starts. American airlines are highest in profit, crew size, passengers, fleet size, and revenue. It seemed like it was really high exactly 1 year ago in April but now it's at a low so I don't think its really that good. Delta has the most assets and has the best market capitalization and they always get higher every year during the same times so its a steady stock. Turkish Airlines has the most countries served so I think it would be good but I'm not sure. I'll probably get apple regardless when they make the next announcement for an event when people start ordering new phones. Tmobile looks like it's constantly growing. There is also this drone aviation holding Corp. which recently had a spike, went down and is now going up. even tho it is at a low price per share, it seems like it would be a great stock to invest in. I don't think Disney would do me much good because the streaming thing already spiked it and I missed my mark. NIKE is whatever. I've heard good things about the motley fool but it's been the same for a while now. I've really been wanting to get a marijuana stock but its really hard to know which companies are going to do well in marijuana. It's gonna be legalized in the US so people are going to start using it more and more and in Canada, the use of it is spreading like wildfire. and for the final one, etrade; it has its own stock. I don't know but I feel like stocks have growing popularity and a lot of people will rely on them for making money. it's currently at $45 and it just went down a lot. it looks like it's going up again so now might be a good time to buy. I really don't know what would be good to buy. I would love to hear your opinions, ideas and suggestions to help me start off with stocks. What would be the best stock for me to get?

New York(CNN Business) On Wednesday, Boeing will give its most public accounting yet of how the 737 Max crisis has hurt its bottom line.

The company is set to release its financial report for the first three months of the year. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv are forecasting that earnings per share fell 11%, compared to the same quarter last year. Experts had previously forecast that Boeing's quarterly earnings would increase 18%.

Don't try this at home.

&amp;#x200B;

If you missed yesterday's Tesla's Autonomy Investor event, watch the full presentation. If you don't understand it, try. If you still don't understand it, sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock didn't move, so I've loaded up.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to convince anyone of anything, but here are some questions to ask yourself:

&amp;#x200B;

* Is Tesla's data lead (2 orders of magnitude and counting....360k vehicles on the road right now sending training data back to base at every driver intervention) unassailable?
* Does Tesla have the best, cheapest and most energy efficient self driving computer? 
* Has Tesla built custom software for their custom hardware which will provide efficiencies no one else can match unless they too build their own full self driving (FSD) hardware and software?
* Will Tesla be first to achieve (FSD)?
* Will Tesla be first to gain regulatory approval for FSD?
* Is Tesla the ONLY vehicle manufacturer producing FSD-ready vehicles RIGHT NOW?
* Will Tesla's Model 3 drive train last 1 million+ miles?
* Will the new battery (next year) last 1 million+ miles?
* Will Uber, Lyft, Waymo raise capital and run at enormous losses so they can cut their ride costs by 100-200% to compete with the Tesla robo taxis, or will they begin building or buying their own vehicles. If so, who from?
* What will happen to the value of existing vehicles on the road when Tesla achieves FSD? 
* What will happen to company valuations of ICE manufacturers who haven't transitioned ALL new vehicles to electric AND full self driving when the first EV manufacturer achieves FSD?
* What will happen to Tesla's net profit when they ""turn on"" their robo taxi fleet, taking 25-30% of all user-owned rides, and 100% of all Tesla-owned rides? Approx cashflow analysis suggests a $38,000 (retail) Model 3 will generate $30,000/yr in the fleet, and last 10 years. **READ THAT AGAIN**. A $38,000 asset (built for less, but consumers can buy for that) can ROI \~80% in year 1.... year 2 and beyond is pure cream.
* Did Tesla executed on EVERYTHING in the ""Secret Tesla Master Plan"" of 2006 ( [https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) )?
* Is Tesla on the way to executing EVERYTHING in Master Plan Part Deux ([https://www.tesla.com/BLOG/MASTER-PLAN-PART-DEUX](https://www.tesla.com/BLOG/MASTER-PLAN-PART-DEUX))?
* Who is poised to produce an equivalent or better vehicle at scale? 

&amp;#x200B;

Food for thought.

Brian Cox, CEO and Chairman of Surge Holdings, commented, “This trademark approval is a key milestone, as we rapidly build our brand around the SurgePays™ retail blockchain network, which transforms the traditional retail supply chain by providing ‘mom and pop’ retailers as well as corner stores with a virtual distribution hub to access global products.  As evidence of our traction and growing brand awareness, we are on track to roll out the platform to approximately 40,000 retail locations by the end of this year alone.  In addition, we are increasing our brand awareness among consumers through our SurgePhone Wireless service and our SurgePays™ reloadable debit card.  These products are expected to generate a significant and high margin recurring revenue stream for Surge in the months and years ahead.  More importantly, these products are designed to attract retailers to our distribution platform by providing them highly differentiated and recurring revenue products targeting low income and under-banked consumers.  This latest trademark will serve to further protect our brand as we seek to rapidly establish our pre-eminent position within the market.”

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

We have been reporting for years that Tesla would be building their own custom chips since they hired Jim Keller in 2016 and licensing IP from AMD. These chips being already in the cars would mean an immediate drop in orders from NVIDIA, at over 5000 cars a week the revenue will be missed. This move provides Tesla with more flexibility in how they control their network and self-driving mechanisms while also reducing the costs to make the vehicles, aiding the companies goal of lowering manufacturing cost for the Model 3.

&amp;#x200B;

From the above Vanguard site, what's the difference between ""Returns after taxes on distributions"" and ""Returns after taxes on distributions and sales of fund shares"" and what causes ""Returns after taxes on distributions and sales of fund shares"" to be so much lower?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, for Vanguard **500 Index Fund Adm** the "" Returns after taxes on distributions"" for 1 year was ""8.93%"" and the "" Returns after taxes on distributions and sales of fund shares "" was "" 5.95% "". What causes this large discrepancy?

&amp;#x200B;

I read the link which says learn more about after tax returns but I couldn't figure it out.

I’m a value investor, so I don’t define my success with a “near-term” outlook , as I’m usually cool with holding a position for a year or more as long as I’m confident in my due diligence.  I’m also not looking to enter 100+ trades a year, partly because of commissions and partly because of tax implications (but don’t know if this is a self-limiting view that only hurts me).

But there are a few market correction situations that arise when a stock I own appreciates 20% in a few weeks or a month - much faster than I anticipated it would - and my gut will usually always tell me the stock shot up too fast and is likely to pare back a little bit.  

I basically won my trade at that point, and I would need to calculate a new price target and weigh whether it’s worth holding.  I don’t know if you call this a cognitive bias, being “lazy”, or simply wanting to avoid declaring it on my taxes - but it’s hard for me to pull the trigger on closing the position earlier than I anticipated.  

So due to some combination of those reasons I find myself holding suboptimal positions in a case like the one above where I see less value going forward due to the recent run-up than I saw back at the time I invested.

Sorry if this comes off as too abrasive.  

""I dont buy XYZ stock because the single product that the company makes, out of hundred of services/products, I dont like""

Do not let your opinion on one product from a company make the decision for whether you should buy or not. I hear all the time from bad investors, ""I wont buy facebook, snapchat, or Apple because I dont like their..."" There is more complexity to consider to these companies. I personally do not like any of these companies as a consumer, but after reading their 10-k report (document that tells me how much debt they currently have, CEO experience, revenue they're making) I have profited by making plays with this knowledge. 


""A candidate just got elected in office and they will make the markets rally/crash""

This is another bad common opinion. The market does not care who is in control of congress or the white house. Political offices have smaller influences on the stock market, with the exception of policies that would explicitly effect companies. Such as Warren calling for the break up of Google and Facebook. Better indicators before political office would be the federal reserve lowering/raising rates, US dollar strength, consumer index, etc.


""I feel like the market is too high""

Stop using your feelings, justify an opinion with evidence without using past stock prices. Do you have proof the European economy suddenly at a higher risk of recession? Make a hypothesis. ""If the Brexit vote passes, then English banks will lose revenue because...""


""The weed market is going to explode!""

This is speculation. Which company is going to do well into the future? Think back to the dot com bubble, everyone said Napster was about to take off while there was a ton of speculation occurring about the internet and how revenues would be made in the future. Avoid speculation or at least realize how much risk you are taking. When you expect a stock to go up in value based on an if of an if of an if...

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, April 22nd, 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/22/what-you-need-to-know-in-the-market-today.html)

* Investors appear cautious ahead of the final seven trading days of April, with futures pointing to a lower open this morning after the S&amp;P 500 logged its first weekly decline in four weeks. However, the Dow gained ground in last week’s holiday-shortened trading. (CNBC)
* Meanwhile, the Dow was just 1% below its October record close. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.9% shy of its September record close. The Nasdaq was 1.4% short of its August record close. But the Nasdaq 100 finished at an all-time high Thursday. (CNBC)
* U.S. oil was spiking higher this morning, but not enough to exit correction territory, on reports that Washington plans to end sanctions waivers for Iranian crude. In November, the U.S. reimposed sanctions after President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear accord. (CNBC)
* On the economic calendar, the National Association of Realtors issues March existing home sales at 10 a.m. ET. Among the companies out with earningsthis morning are Halliburton (HAL), Kimberly-Clark (KMB) and WW Grainger (GWW). Whirlpool (WHR) releases numbers after the closing bell. (CNBC)
Authorities lifted a curfew in Sri Lanka today, a day after a string of bombings at churches and luxury hotels across the Indian Ocean island killed 290 people and * wounded about 500. Americans are among the dead. (Reuters)
* Rep. Seth Moulton, the latest Democrat to enter the 2020 race, launched a presidential bid today focused on national security. The 40-year-old Marine combat veteran may be best known, perhaps, for his opposition to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. (NBC News)
* Democratic presidential candidates diverge in how to respond to the Mueller report, with Elizabeth Warren calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump, Cory Booker saying not yet and Bernie Sanders calling for more congressional investigations. (WSJ)
* House Democrats to decide soon whether to seek Trump impeachment (USA Today)
* Tesla (TSLA) said it immediately sent a team to investigate an apparent explosion of one of its cars in Shanghai on Sunday. It’s not immediately clear which model was affected, but reports indicated the electric vehicle was parked at the time of the fire. (CNBC)
* Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans to hold an investor event today, focusing the electric automaker’s self-driving efforts. Separately, Musk and the SEC asked a federal judge for more time to negotiate a settlement over recent Musk tweets. (MarketWatch)
* Boeing (BA), whose 737 Max jets are grounded, defends itself against allegations in The New York Times over its 787 Dreamliner. The paper claims “shoddy production and weak oversight” at the jet maker’s South Carolina factory.
* Samsung is postponing its China launch event for its foldable smartphone, just days after reports of defective screens on the $2,000 device. Journalists, including CNBC’s Todd Haselton, who reviewed the product over the past few weeks, reported issues with the screen. (CNBC)
* China’s Huawei reported a 39 percent year-on-year increase in first-quarter revenue despite continued political pressure from nations including the U.S. The networking equipment maker said 5G deployment provides “unprecedented opportunities for growth.” (CNBC)
* US attacks Huawei and China without its own 5G strategy (CNBC)
* Nissan filed another criminal complaint against former Chairman Carlos Ghosn related to an aggravated breach of trust under Japan’s Companies Act. It’s the fourth charge since his arrested in November on suspicion of financial misconduct. Ghosn has denied all allegations. (Reuters)

fighting to improve capital access for entrepreneurs - the heroes that drive the innovation and job formation that will make or break the future for mankind.\n\nDuring this time I’ve been lucky to have served as the Vice Chairman of NASDAQ - where I got to meet the leaders of such world changing companies as Apple (Steve Jobs - I discussed with Steve the need for remote email in cellular five years before the launch of the iPhone), Microsoft (both Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer), Staples (Tom Stemberg) and Cisco (John Chambers). \xa0More importantly, I had the privilege to put in share repurchase programs with NASDAQ listed companies to support stock prices as we reopened markets in the way of 9/11 and I advised Mike Oxley, then Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, to do the Airline Bailout Bill as a way of bridging the US economy to smoother economic waters.\n\nAfter leaving NASDAQ, I worried that regulators had unwittingly destroyed the greatest IPO market ever known. I was the first to discover and document catastrophic decline in the number of public US companies relative to foreign countries - most notably China. Congress circulated our studies and soon I found myself testifying in front of the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and at the Securities and Exchange Commission. This led to a legislative movement continuing to this day, that includes [The JOBS Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act) that enabled securities crowdfunding, a form of IPO lite called “Reg. A+” and a new form of private placement called 506(c). I was in the Rose Garden of the White House when President Obama signed The JOBS Act into law on April 5, 2012.\n\nIn August of 2016 I took my own company, Weild &amp; Co. in a different direction to revolutionize Investment Banking by creating a platform - WEILD.NET to Bring Wall Street to Main Street. \xa0\xa0Throughout my career, I bore witness to how regulation increasingly favored large corporate entities at the expense of startups and regular, everyday businesses. As someone who has helped to nurture every wave of technology from genetic engineering to the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and now the blockchain, I believe fervently that the US must lead in technology or it will be relegated to the dustbin of history.Recently, I’ve taken my passion for startups to the digital world, where I serve as co-chairman of [55.com](http://55.com/), the world’s first asset network. \n\nOur mission is to make capital more easily accessible through tokenization, and, to create the free trade of assets, similar to the free trade of goods that we’ve already achieved. By assigning a value to traditional assets through the blockchain, 55 allows users to trade any asset class without the limitations of time or location. I believe that this innovation will lead to lower transaction costs, improved liquidity and more efficient allocation of capital which in turn will contribute to economic growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I sent proof to the moderators already, but here is my [proof picture](https://i.imgur.com/nVYj51L.jpg)\n\nEDIT 2: \\[9:30pm ET\\] I took a break for nourishment and life, but I'm heading back in to answer more questions.

I had a shower thought this morning of the possibility that Disney purchases Netflix 3-5 years down the line.  With the purchase of Fox, and therefore Hulu, in addition to launching Disney+, they have a real chance at eating into Netflix's subscriber base.  Can anyone else envision a future where Netflix is consistently losing subscribers, and Disney agrees to buy them out in order to bring on their remaining monthly revenue.  Disney's market cap would expand 10 fold and they would engrave themselves as the one true media giant in the world.  They would fold Netflix's infrastructure into Hulu and the transition would be seamless.

A direct public offering (DPO) is different from a traditional IPO due to some of the following reasons:

-Firm raises capital directly without the help of an underwriter
-Firm does not issue any *new* shares but instead makes shares owned by early investors/employee’s/etc available for sale and purchase
-There is no lockup period for early investors

I’m wondering how the company exactly “raises capital” with this method, because instead of issuing new shares in return for capital, the company just allows already existing shares to be traded on the public market.   The only way I can think of consists of the company selling it’s treasury stock to the market to raise capital.

Live in a rural area and am a pretty frugal person anyway so I’ve always lived comfortably. Had 10K saved up in a standard savings account at my local bank which I was making around .03% interest on. Obviously that’s horrible, it doesn’t even keep up with inflation so I joined Robinhood a few months ago and put 7K in my portfolio.

I plan to settle it down some (okay, a lot lol) and, in the future, transfer my funds to a better broker (etrade, Schwabb, etc). 

I have been bouncing thoughts around in my head about the portfolio I want to build, and I’m seeing all sorts of pros and cons to a number of way I could invest. Basically, with my age I’m thinking of taking a lot of high risk, high reward (TEUM, for example). But it also sounds sweet to begin establishing a dividend heavy portfolio to sit on for 40 years (DIS/APPL,JNJ). There is also that company called Amazon that could turn 5 shares into 50K for all we know. 

I need some advice from folks waaaay more knowledgeable than me..

Should I invest in various promising, growth stocks, like TEUM? High risk, high reward. 

Should I sit on 5 shares of heavyweight Amazon for 10+ years (and increase that position as paydays come)? 

Would It be worth buying, say, 20-40 shares of DIS/APPL/MSFT? Obviously damn good companies that will see rising share prices but the dividend would not amount to much with such a low number of shares. 

I also want to get in the weed sector before the boom and just ride it out for years and years. Do recommend MJ (ETF) or would you instead buy a few individual stocks (HEXO, ACB, etc)? 

Or what about ETF’s? Should I just buy some Vanguard’s and build on those positions instead of individual stocks?

# **Earnings and data could be proof that slowdown fears were overblown  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/19/earnings-and-data-could-be-proof-that-slowdown-fears-were-overblown.html)**
*****
&gt; Earnings season shifts into a higher gear in the week ahead, as investors also watch for fresh economic data that could show that the economy is pulling out of a temporary rut.
*****
&gt; Amazon, Boeing, Microsoft and ExxonMobil are among more than 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting quarterly results. According to Refinitiv, 74% of the companies reporting so far have beaten expectations. Based on forecasts and actual reports, earnings for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole are expected to decline 1.7%, the first negative quarter in three years. Some forecasters had projected an earnings decline of 4% or more.
*****
&gt; The equivalent of the economy’s first-quarter report card will be released Friday, with the first reading of GDP. The outlook for first-quarter growth has suddenly shifted upward, after a series of better data releases later in the quarter. CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey shows economists’median forecast is now tracking at 2.4%, way above the 1% expected earlier in the quarter, when severe winter weather and the government shutdown were stifling the economy.
*****
&gt; At the same time, investors are feeling better about global growth and far less fearful of a recession in the near term. One reason is that China’s data has also been picking up. This past week, China reported first-quarter GDP at 6.4%, slightly better than the 6.3% expected by economists.
*****
&gt; “I think a lot of this is leveraged on economic activity. I think investors have kind of gotten past this notion of global downturn. The China number was pretty good earlier in the week. I do think next week is going to be important for earnings. We’re going to get a great cross section of industries,” said Jack Ablin, CIO at Cresset Wealth Advisors. On Wednesday, China’s first quarter GDP
*****
&gt; U.S. trade talks with China could be also important in the week ahead, with negotiations continuing and investors awaiting news of a summit between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping.
*****
&gt; Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he still sees deteriorating fundamentals for both earnings and the economy, even though data appears to be improving.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s a function of expectations were probably dropping too quickly, and I think recent data is telling you that growth isn’t collapsing but it’s slowing,” he said. “I think that’s very important. That’s probably going to be the most important dynamic. That’s probably going to continue.”
*****
&gt; That could make for a choppier market at some point, he said. Suzuki said he could see stocks ending the year higher than current levels but he expects to see the market pull back first.
*****
&gt; The market shrugged off Thursday’s release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Trump campaign and Russian election interference.

&gt; “This type of thing firmly falls into the category of it can move the needle for the market on a daily or weekly performance basis, but it’s not going to be a longer term story for the market,” Suzuki said. Analysts have said the economy’s performance is more important for Trump’s reelection than the report at this point.

# Pre-election year Mays: Just 10th overall DJIA and S&amp;P 500

&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,008,721 for November-April in 68 years compared to just $1,031 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $757,335 for November-April in 68 years compared to a gain of just $9,079 for May-October.

&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

&gt; In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up ten times in the past twenty years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by eleven sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and four losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Since 1950, pre-election-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA and S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ, #6 Russell 1000 and #5 Russell 2000.

# Liberate Your Portfolio Sell Passover

&gt; Much like the ancient Hebrews’ exodus out of Egypt, springtime and the Passover holiday are often an excellent time of year to consider major portfolio moves.

&gt; Some may remember the old saying on the Street, “Buy Rosh Hashanah, Sell Yom Kippur.” Though it had a good record at one time, it stopped working in the middle of the last century. It still gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

&gt; The basis for the new pattern, “Sell Rosh Hashanah-Buy Yom Kippur-Sell Passover,” is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here.

&gt; We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and opportune months. We then took it a step further and calculated the return from Yom Kippur to Passover, which conveniently occurs in March or April, right near the end of our “Best Six Months” strategy.

&gt; Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 55% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.2%. It often pays to be a contrarian when old bromides are tossed around, buying instead of selling Yom Kippur – and selling Passover. From Passover to Yom Kippur DJIA averages just 1.6% and is littered with nasty declines.

# Individual Investors Remaining Neutral

&gt; Last week, bullish sentiment as indicated by the AAII's weekly survey of individual investors came in at the second highest level of the year at 40.29%. Declines this week seemed to have weighed on bulls as the percentage of investors reporting as bullish fell to 37.56%. That is back below the historical average of 38.2%, though, it is also not far away from where bullish sentiment has stayed for much of the year. This week's level deviates slightly from the Investors Intelligence survey which saw bearish sentiment unchanged while optimism rose to the highest levels since October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041819-AAII-Bullish-Sentiment.png))**

&gt; The bearish camp seems to have borrowed from the bulls as 21.83% of investors reported bearish sentiment versus 20.38% last week. This is a fairly small movement relative to what could be observed in the past couple of months. For example, last week and in the final week of March, bearish sentiment fell by over 7%. In other words, bearish sentiment seems stable around the lower end of the range from the past few years, now several percentage points below the historical average of 30.31%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041819-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**

&gt; While bullish and bearish sentiment remains high and low, respectively, neutral sentiment is also very elevated. At 40.61%, the percentage of investors reporting neutral sentiment is now slightly over one standard deviation above the historical average. The last time this happened was in late July of last year.

# Mortgage Applications Hit Nine-Year High

&gt; This morning the Mortgage Bankers' Association (MBA) reported mortgage application volumes for the week ending April 12th this morning. Refinancing volumes dropped over 8% after an 11.4% WoW drop last week. Refinancing is still running at a strong pace (roughly twice the pace where they finished last year), but the more economically relevant result was the strong purchase application data. Applications for purchase are a leading indicator of home sales, so the new cycle high in purchase application volumes posted this week is a good sign that the housing market remains in a much better position than where it stood last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041719-MBA-2.png))**

&gt; Weekly data can be tricky to seasonally adjust, so it's also worth taking a peek at weekly data without seasonal adjustments. As shown, we're right near the typical seasonal peak for application volumes, and as-of this week, only two weeks since 2009 have recorded stronger purchase application volumes. That confirms the basic message of the seasonally adjusted index, which is that mortgage applications are running at a very strong pace.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041719-MBA-1.png))**

&gt; On a YoY basis, purchase application volumes are not extremely strong, but it's pretty clear there's a healthier trend than the period in the second half of last year. Since week-to-week applications can be pretty volatile, it helps to smooth things out with a rolling 4-week average. Using this approach, the 4-week average of purchase applications is up 8.2% YoY, the best pace since the week ended February 9th of last year.

# Chart of the Day: Fourth Best Start on Record in Junk Bond Market

&gt; After a rough Q4 for the junk bond market, 2019 has turned into a banner year for the sector.

I am a recent graduate of a finance degree and really want to provide value to people who want to begin investing in particular equities. I was wondering if there were any redditors out there who would like to coordinate with me in making the best membership for people that covers a lot of bases I possibly could. 

With regards to the design of forming an informed investor, I want to: 1) Getting their mindset right; 2) Delivering general lessons about compounding and optimization with their own personal balance sheet; and 3) Finding solid stocks that they invest into for being good value/growth orientated companies. 

Throughout my research, I've concluded that finding solid companies to hold long long-term positions in would be the most comprehensive yet simple way to go about engaging into building wealth for individuals. This could work by teaching people how to model companies via excel and valuate them to find a relatively good intrinsic value to tell them whether or not the stock is a good investment. The membership would have high value compared to watching a box set of videos because I want to offer up my personal time for people to get results. 

About me: 

\- I've worked in the financial sector for 2 years developing and selling financial algorithms to large investment funds around the world while I was in school (re. hardingsoftware.com). This is why I feel that I am qualified to work with a diverse set of people with different backgrounds, philosophies, ect. 

\- I've worked through a large part of the CFA curriculum and plan on taking their Level 1 exam in December 2019. 

\- I enjoyed the learning process for finance I had been taught under and want to deliver my knowledge and abilities without some of the pitfalls I had experienced. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I am looking for a set of 20-40 people to coordinate with of all investment skill levels so I can deliver a comprehensive investing course for people who wish to build wealth. This post is NOT intended to sell anything, it is just meant to gather volunteers to help make a good piece of content for people who don't know where to start or are struggling in investments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much everyone! I wish you all the best :)

Do I basically owe the difference of 52-42? Do I owe 52k MORE? Not sure how that would be possible considering I didn't hold anything, didn't lose any money, and am flat everyday by EOD.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Would you provide your blunt feedback on this stock picking strategy?

I've been cheap index investing my entire life and want to switch to this stock picking strategy (for the US equity part of my portfolio) because I'm hoping it will produce slightly higher returns with slightly lower variance compared to the S&amp;P 500 index.

I'm currently investing via mean variance analysis with my assets in the following four asset classes: US Equity, Emerging equity, Developed foreign equity, REIT.

Since the markets will be closed tomorrow for Good Friday, I figured I'd go ahead and throw the earnings post up a day earlier than usual.

Keep in mind though that since I am posting this a day early, some companies might not be pictured in the calendar above, since like I said it's still early. It's always suggested that you all confirm on your own through other means that whichever companies you are interested in, are indeed reporting on that particular day. In other words, that you're not solely relying on this weekly earnings calendar alone!

* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell

I have a question about trading stocks.  I have read about pump and dump schemes with stocks and trading becomes suspended or is even removed from the exchange.

Of course insider information is illegal and puts that person at an advantage.  What happens to the person who is a regular joe buck and take a gamble on a stock and it soars?

For example, Joe decides to buy a penny stock with a few thousand dollars.  He sits on it for a while and out of nowhere it soars to a few dollars.  He sells and gets out.  The SEC accuses of a pump and dump scheme and suspends trading.  Is Joe’s money now considered “illegitimate” since it came from a scheme unbeknownst to him and can be seized?

The reason I asked is because on the TD App, they have a new section that mentioned a few stocks that were a part of a PND scheme.  The companies themselves were not apart of it but particular investors were.  Does all the regular joes get punished by loosing all gains in this?

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease caused by inflammation and damage brought on by the buildup of fat on the liver.

In some cases however, the buildup of fat around the liver leads to inflammation and tissue damage to the vital organ, preventing normal function. NASH can progress in patients, developing into fibrosis, cirrhosis or severe scarring of the liver which is often seen at the terminal stages of chronic liver disease.


GlobalData forecasts that the NASH market will grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 63% across the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, reaching $18.3B by 2026. Amazingly, there are no current therapeutic options approved for the treatment of NASH. With the market open for the taking, many companies are partaking in the race to be the first to approval, over 55 companies to be exact.


Currently, the largest segment of the NASH treatment options will derive from those benefiting patients with cirrhosis, with these treatments expected to account for over 60% of the NASH market by the 2026 mark and total sales of over $11.3B.


In the 7 previously mentioned countries, the number of cases of NASH each year are expected to reach nearly 50 million by 2027, with the United States having about 50% prevalence, followed by Japan.


As competition intensifies and pricing pressure from governments and society eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other previously profitable disease categories, with an over crowded field for developmental oncology therapeutics, the market and forecasters see NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. Companies such as Pfizer are taking a look at new opportunities to continue their success and prevent diminishing returns in oversaturated markets.


**Disease Overview and Development**


The development of the disease is often argued among healthcare professionals, often both linked to factors such as obesity as well as genetic and epi-genetic predispositions. NASH has been observed to occur frequently alongside cardiovascular disease while NASH also increases coronary deposits creating a greater risk of cardiovascular events. Liver failure as the result of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis is a major result of the disease frequently creates the need of liver transplants. Liver disease in patients with NASH is the third leading cause of death in the patient population, while the leading cause of death is hepatocellular carcinoma, a lethal form of cancer.

When deciphering when NAFLD becomes NASH, there is a score system in place dubbed the NAS score which was proposed for untreated patients based on histological analysis of liver biopsy and judged upon steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning or cell degeneration. If a patient receives at least one count in each of the three categories or scores a 3 out of 8 total, the patient is considered NASH positive.

One consequence of NASH is the development of liver fibrosis which is measured by a fibrosis score that goes from F0 (no fibrosis) to F4 (cirrhosis). The levels range from Type 1 being NAFL with steatosis alone, Type 2 being NAFL with steatosis plus inflammation, Type 3 being NASH with steatosis plus hepatocyte injury or ballooning, and Type 4 being NASH with steatosis plus fibrosis. After Type 4, the liver develops full cirrhosis.

In the end, experts don't know why some people with a buildup of fat in the liver get NASH and some don't. It could be that something in the environment triggers the inflammation in those people. Or maybe it runs in their families. As mentioned above, there are a multitude of things that put people at risk for NASH and for liver damage including:

**Obesity.**

*Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

*High cholesterol and high triglycerides.

*Metabolic syndrome.

*Genetic and Epi-genetic disposition


The continual increase of obesity in the western world and occurrence of type 2 diabetes along with high fat diets is going to continue to drive NASH. As the aging population from a fast food generation starts to mature in to their elderly years, the patient population for this disease is going to be startling.


A majority of the patient population of NASH are 40 to 50 years old and have one or more of the problems listed above. Yet NASH can happen in people who have none of these risk factors and show no symptoms. A majority of patients report feeling fine and having never known of the disease manifestation. Common symptoms that appear as NASH progresses include fatigue, weight loss, general weakness, and aches around the liver and stomach. It is often years into the disease when NASH becomes severe that individuals begin to notice the symptoms and it is often too late.



**Off-Label (Supportive Therapies) Drugs for NASH Treatment**


Considering the market outlook, the number of treatment options for NASH is likely to increase significantly with the amount of research being poured into the disease, while the supportive therapies or off-label market share will begin to decrease from its recent peak of 100% in 2016 to 11% in 2027.


**Unmet Need**

Now, there is no approved therapy for the NASH treatment, causing several companies to divert their focus towards the development of targeted drugs with novel mechanism of action in the treatment of this disease. Patients with NASH are associated with a 50% higher chance of death than those patients diagnosed with just NAFLD, according to a recent study.


**Competition in NASH**


With the recent failure from Gilead, whose NASH drug trial STELLAR-4 did not achieve its primary endpoints, the race for FDA approval continues with tightening competition and leaders. I believe that first to market with this product will be crucial to success in the field over the next 2-3 years. While other drug candidates may see approval, a majority of patients will likely be dosing the first to market product to treat their debilitating disease.


As over 50 different companies are moving to find the best treatment, there are several standouts who appear to be potential winners for both patients and investors. Here I am going to cover 4 different companies drug candidates handling NASH and a quick synopsis of their market position in timing and financials.


From the early looks of things, we seem to have a winner.



**Intercept Pharmaceuticals**

Recently, Intercept Pharmaceuticals announced additional positive data from their REGENERATE Phase III study, which just so happens to be the very first successful Phase III study completed on patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH. With intentions to file for regulatory approval in not only the United States, but Europe as well in the second half of 2019, the recent dip in share price appears to be a tempting opportunity.

Intercept focused on the study of obeticholic acid (OCA) in patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH. Once daily OCA dosed at 25 mg met primary endpoint in improving fibrosis of the liver with no worsening in NASH diagnosis through an 18-month analysis. It is important to note however, that there were two separate arms in the NASH study, with only one of the two meeting the endpoint. Based on a previously established agreement with the FDA, only one of the two endpoints was needed to conclude a successful trial.

The primary efficacy analysis assessed efficacy at 18 months in 931 patients with stage 2 or 3 liver fibrosis due to NASH. There were fairly low levels of study discontinuation throughout the population which was nearly identical across both arms and placebo in the study: 16% in placebo, 17% in OCA 10 mg and 15% in OCA 25 mg. An additional pre-specified full efficacy analysis at 18 months added an exploratory cohort of 287 NASH patients with stage 1 liver fibrosis and additional risk factors who were at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis (N=1,218).

Safety of the drug trial was done across 1,968 randomized patients who received a minimum of one dose of OCA or placebo. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and the most common were consistent with the known profile of OCA. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms: 11% in placebo, 11% in OCA 10 mg and 14% in OCA 25 mg. Unfortunately, there were 3 deaths in the study, yet none were considered related to treatment or the trial. The most common adverse event reported was dose-related pruritus: 19% in placebo, 28% in OCA 10 mg and 51% in OCA 25 mg.

OCA treatment was found to be associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol, with a peak increase of 22.6 mg/dL at 4 weeks and subsequently reversing and approaching baseline at month 18, which happened to be consistent with previous trials and data with on OCA. Triglycerides rapidly and continually decreased in the OCA treatment arms through month 18. There was an associated risk of higher incidence of gallstones or cholecystitis in OCA 25 mg patients compared to 10 mg and placebo patients.

More recently, Intercept announced that they provided additional positive data to backup their already successful Phase III study. Roughly three times as many patients in the OCA 25 mg group achieved an improvement of fibrosis by ≥2 stages compared to placebo (13.3% vs 4.5%; p=0.0008).

In fibrosis by ≥1 stage, approximately three times as many patients in the OCA 25 mg group improved versus worsened at 38.0% vs 13.1%, while in contrast the placebo group saw 23.2% vs 20.9% respectively. Substantially more patients in the OCA 25 mg group achieved improvements in the key underlying features of NASH, including hepatocellular ballooning, lobular inflammation and normalization of alanine aminotransferase at baseline achieved compared to those in the placebo group.

The company ended 2018 with a strong cash position of roughly $436.2 million and saw revenues of $177.8 million from Ocaliva, which is expected to reach approximately $240 million this year. The company does have a rather high burn rate however, producing a loss of $309.2 million throughout the year, which is actually a nearly 20% improvement on the loss the previous year. I expect that towards the end of 2019 and into 2018 Intercept will look to do a raise to help marketing their flagship NASH product as well as expand on their distribution channels of Ocaliva. With the NASH study coming to an end, the expenses are just transferring.

Like I said, in the NASH space, first to market will be key. Intercept is clearly on their way. There are a few hurdles left in place, but the recent drop in price signals a buy to me. Will only one endpoint be the cause of no approval despite agreement by the FDA?



**Madrigal Pharmaceuticals**

What can I say, I love Madrigal Pharmaceuticals. You can review my synopsis and run down of the company through my post history.

While I won’t use this portion to rehash what I have already written about the company, I will be expanding on their initiation of their Phase III study on multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled MGL-3196 in patients with NASH and fibrosis to resolve NASH and reduce progression of cirrhosis. The study will utilize biopsy confirmed NASH with stage 2 or 3 fibrosis and receive a placebo, 80 mg, or 100 mg dose of resmetirom. A second liver biopsy will be taken at the end of 1 year from first dose in the first 900 patients treated to determine if the endpoint of whether resmetirom shows a significant difference in hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, and no worsening of the fibrosis stage.

The company will also be focusing on reducing in LDL-cholesterol and improvement in fibrosis stage by 1-point or more at the 52-week mark. The study will continue for a total of 54 months. 


Looking at Phase II of the study, the CEO of Madrigal was quoted, “In Phase 2, 25% of all resmetirom treated patients, and 37% of treated patients who were on adequate doses of resmetirom, achieved the Phase 3 NASH resolution endpoint (NASH resolution with at least a 2-point reduction in NAS and no fibrosis stage worsening); both results demonstrated statistically significant differences relative to placebo.”

One key difference in Phase III is the increased dosing of patients. It is hoped that the higher doses might prove more effective than those in Phase II, as the higher dose in the concluded phase did show higher efficacy.

As you might know, MGL-3196 has been proven to be quite the contender for treating NASH, showing efficacy and tolerability through a majority of patients. I have been in this company for many months now, and am very confident in them. I am concerned however with Intercept Pharmaceuticals getting approval within the year, while Madrigal Pharmaceuticals still has many months before their Phase III study is concluded. I will say, Madrigal is my favorite and pick. This current price level, far off its recent highs, is more than attractive to entice me to continue buying.



**Viking Therapeutics**

Viking therapeutics has been the hot topic of conversation when NASH is involved among many retail traders and investors. I believe that this is mainly due to the low entry point, people believe that it is poised to rocket the same way that Madrigal had upon positive data. Whether this is the actual case, I am not sure. I do know however that the stock tends to run off great news, showing signs of high volatility. Let’s take a look.

Viking Therapeutics’ novel drug VK2809 is a selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist which has a high selectivity for liver tissue which suggests treatment for metabolic disorders such as NASH. The company presented an in vivo model in mice of glycogen storage disease at a conference last October showing that VK2809 led to overall improvement in liver health by restoration of autophagy, reduction in steatosis, reduction of inflammation and liver size. All of these positive outcomes pointed to the conclusion that VK2809 is a potential candidate for the treatment of NAFLD and NASH. Further, the company presented results from their Phase II study of VK2809 in patients with NAFLD and elevated LDL-cholesterol at the 12-week point, demonstrating achievement of both primary and secondary endpoints.

The primary endpoint was the statistically significant reduction of LDL-cholesterol compared to a placebo.  The company demonstrated this reduction of LDL-C at both every day and every other day dosing. 

The company's secondary endpoints of reducing liver fat content at 12 weeks of treatment was extremely successful, with over 90% of patients demonstrating a greater than 30% reduction in liver fat content in just 3 months. 

The company just provided an update on their Phase II data, demonstrating that 100% of patients receiving 5 mg of VK2809 dosed daily were experiencing more than 30% reduction from baseline in liver fat content at week 12.  Now THAT is statistically significant. 

I think one of the biggest notes to make about this company is the $302 million in cash as of the end of 2018 that the company has will allow them to operate through 2021 at a minimum.  This is an uninterrupted 2 years of cash runway.  No fear of dilution or offerings in the near future, which for a smaller market cap company like Viking Therapeutics, is massive.  Phase IIb of the study is set to initiate in the second half of 2019, making this year a key year for Viking. 

The company only needs to continue Phase II to completion and obtain liver biopsies of their patients.  Having patients with no confirmed NASH through biopsies is a hurting point for the company.  I believe once they make that step and continue positive results, they can easily see similar gains as Madrigal had.  However hopeful I am for Viking, I remain realistic.  I am debating on adding some to my portfolio in the near future when news starts to die and the price begins to pullback as I know this is a high volatility stock.  The downsides listed above are coupled with the fact that this company is still likely 6+ years away from approval.  Definitely a downer.

Back in February, I decided that QCOMs case vs AAPL was putting a lot of pressure on the QCOMs stock price and realized that the options are very cheap considering the opportunity for a favorable outcome.

I live in Australia, so I am mostly sleeping during US trading hours. Yesterday, however, I woke up at 4 am and decided to put a limit sell order of $0.06 on my options to salvage my losses given that only 2 days are remaining till expiry, and went back to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I wake up at 7 am to go to work, and see the news and realize that my options would have been worth a small fortune and the contract is being traded at $6 each which would have realized a 6000% return for me in 2 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 just because I made a very stupid decision when I woke up at 4 AM! I feel so disgusted with myself and I dont know what to do to feel better.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

A construction company is trying to get my dad to invest in their company. They basically printed out some paper promising him some stocks. I’m assuming this is pre-IPO, but the “contract” that they gave him my dad described as simply written on a word document printed out with basic wording, no company logo and extremely informal as well the contract said something about the company being pharmaceutical company before it became a construction company(according to him.) 

Besides that, what makes me extremely skeptical is that the company’s website says they’ve been around for 15 years but it’s literally just a landing page and the website is not secured. 

Tomorrow I will request for them to send the patent number that they hold that makes their “company worth investing in.”  I just need to look into what they’re promising and not just bs

\- If the person who works at the company shorts their stock, is it considered as Illegal? On the one hand, they did know their company was losing money. But, they waited until there were a few public articles to short their stock.

Today the shares trade at $7.45. Analysts have targets that range from $10.50 to $13.50.

Here's the most recent research report from Beacon:

* ""Viemed reported another record quarterly result. Q4/FY18 revenue/EBITDA was $18.5m/$5m, bringing to a close an incredibly successful year producing $65.3m/$17.2m. Q4 revenue growth was +37% y/y and 7.8% sequentially and driven by a 34% and 8.4% growth in the patient count. For FY18, revenue per patient was $12,350 v/s $11,881, +4% v/s FY17 indicating the impact of the ancillary products that VMD is selling in addition to its core NIV offering. This should continue in FY19. Period ended cash was $10.4m, up from $5.1m in Q4/FY17 despite growing 39% organically with a cap-ex budget of $14m (buying new vents), indicating the strong free cash flow. RoE was a very impressive 29%.""
* ""The company gave Q1/FY19 revenue guidance of $20-$20.5 million with a similar margin profile as historic (\~27%), which would imply EBITDA of \~$5.5 million ($22 million run-rate). To illustrate the very strong organic growth profile of VMD over the past 2 years, over the last 8 quarters (Q1/FY17-Q1/FY19), Viemed will have doubled revenue.""
* ""In fact, **we believe the growth at Viemed may be accelerating**, as witnessed by Q1 sequential revenue guidance growth of 11% v/s the 8% in Q4. Consider:

1. We know that there is a large opportunity with the entire NIV market at less than 10% of its potential. As physicians and care givers become aware of the clinical efficacy of the therapy, we believe referrals from them could snowball. The clinical study undertaken by KPMG has just been started to be marketed by Viemed. Dissemination of that report should dramatically accelerate awareness;
2. VMD has made its initial inroads into the VA (Veterans Hospital). It believes there are likely 200,000-600,000 patients who could benefit from NIV therapy. (Note veterans have a higher likelihood of COPD than the general population). While it only has 10 patients at 4 VA hospitals, we believe this huge opportunity could come to the fore in the near future;
3. In terms of infrastructure to handle the growth, VMD hired 9 sales reps in Q4 and 18 in 2018, bringing its total to 70. The company plans to aggressively hire new reps and both deepen coverage in existing geographic areas as well as expand into new territories. It is currently licensed in 36 states, but only operating in 25 (becoming operational in those 11 states is imminent) and it expects to be in the remainder of the Lower 48 states in the next 12 months. The company is particularly excited about the opportunity in California, Florida and Colorado.""

* ""We are raising our FY19 forecast and introducing FY20 estimates. For FY19, we are moving to $83.9m/$22.8m (from $80.6m/$21.9m) and $109m/$29.7m for FY20. **We are raising our target to C$10.50** (from C$9.50) to reflect our upwardly revised FY19 EBITDA forecast.""

TLDR:

Natural Gas &gt; Oil

Oil &gt; Gold

Oil &gt; SPX

&amp;#x200B;

Gold &lt;=&gt; SPX 50/50 , I hope for this to drop a bit to BTFD and then have another DOT COM.

&amp;#x200B;

MOON Portfolio:

15% Natural Gas Futures {unless you find low maintenance ETF that tracks 1 to 1 NG.F}

15% Oil Futures

15% Oil Company Stocks

20% Cash (safety net for the below)

35% Housing down payment on Maximum Leverage. Rental/Agricultural income must be &gt;= mortgage. Must be low property tax zone to avoid inflation rising it too high. Ideal to buy now (we look like we are the same time period as 1985 for housing) and sell when ratio is like in 2001 and 1970s. Use your leverage now to make 50% profit at least, even if we deflate a bit soon, and swap for gold and then swap the gold for housing. Even with bullion tax, you're making stacks.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts on Future:

&amp;#x200B;

We are likely to have a repeat of the 70s/80s inflationary recessions \[Stock market rises 2x but dollar worth is 10x less, so 5x relative loss at best in general stock market, unless you buy businesses that benefit from it\]. Combine this with larger uneducated population now, and you will have RIOTS on street due to 3x larger wealth gap. Housing can fall 50% to GOLD but GOLD can rise 50% without $ price decline, or it can fall 50% in $ price and no movement in GOLD, but that leads to another 2001-2011 currency devaluation and a 2011 style MEGA bounce, so BTFD time there, if we get lucky.

Either way, best spot is NGAS and OIL. Expect heavy sanctions or income embargo or war on countries with petroleum.

This can lead to as much as $250/gallon of petroleum with current M.

&amp;#x200B;

With exception of AAPL, Warren Buffet's BRK entire portfolio is positioned exactly for this.

&amp;#x200B;

An airline based in Auckland, Air New Zealand, the airline has been a staple of the country since it's founding in the country's capital Wellington in 1940.  The airline has reasonable growth in the Oceanic, Tasman, and Asian Markets. The airline also serves destinations in the U.S. including Los Angeles and San Francisco.

&amp;#x200B;

How can we use their growth to predict their future market performance? We need to apply their research to help airlines within other parts of the world do better. I read up on their interim financial results for the fiscal year made by their Chief Finacial Officer Jeff McDowall. It was a very interesting report that stated why Air New Zealand needs to grow in the Southern Pacific air travel markets. Mr. McDowall has been with Air New Zealand since 2008 and spent 6 years prior as a management consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers in NZ. I will link his Powerpoint below if anyone is interested in reading over them. They have acquired many new planes within the past few years, and have a very low fleet age.  Air NZ does not use any 737MAXs, so the problems recently with the MAX airplanes did not affect them grounding any of their planes. Air NZ received a good Baa2 rating from Moody's this year, and shows reasonable growth of Air New Zealand Ltd.'s stock performance within the coming fiscal years.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.

Some of these companies show great potential for long term, but I’m not interested in that at the moment. I slowly reinvest my profits into the long terms bit by bit. AMZN being one of them.

In #12, I would like to see what type of qualifications the board has if they're going to be making recommendations to me, the shareholder.

\#15 seems to hit a bit close considering our current state of confusion in the governments and courts. I understand after reading the proxy how some people would just NOT vote on proposals and that shouldn't be considered as an against vote but instead not counted at all. Just being a shareholder shouldn't mandate that you vote, it should give you the right to vote of your own volition.

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 15th, 2019.

# **Some optimistic corporate outlooks in the week ahead could lift the stock market to a record  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/get-ready-for-companies-to-tell-you-more-about-the-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s now up to corporate America to reveal whether the U.S. economy simply hit a soft patch this winter, as many suspect, or is on the verge of falling into an even deeper rut.
*****
&gt; Earnings from a broad swath of industries, like financials, technology, transportation and consumer products roll out in the coming week as the first-quarter earnings season gets underway. According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline 2.3 percent in the first negative quarter in three years, but it is business leaders’ comments on the future outlook that are even more important.
*****
&gt; Commentary and guidance is always a big deal, but this quarter it is critical. Analysts do not agree on whether the first quarter earnings season represents the trough, or even whether the second quarter will see a gain or decline in profit growth.
*****
&gt; At the same time, economic data, like March’s jobs report, are beginning to turn more positive, and first quarter growth has quickly gone from forecasts of nearly flattish back in January to now around 2%, on the back of better March releases. The economic data has been uneven, in part because of the government shutdown, but it has yet to prove the economy is back on track.
*****
&gt; “The market has been very sensitive to data that’s been picking up. The market is reflecting that, even though there’s talk of an earnings recession. What you don’t want is an earnings recession leading to an economic recession. If companies believe there’s a major downturn in revenue growth, they stop spending and ultimately they fire people and that leads to a recession,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; The stock market is also at an important inflection point, with the major indexes closing in on all-time highs. The S&amp;P 500 pressed through 2,900 Friday, seen as a point of psychological resistance. The S&amp;P ended the week at 2,907, for a weekly gain of 0.5%. The next target traders are watching is the closing high 2,930 on the S&amp;P. The all-time high was an intraday 2,940, reached on Sept. 21.
*****
&gt; Earnings season got off to a good start with J.P. Morgan Chase’s quarterly earnings report Friday. CEO Jamie Dimon was very positive, saying the U.S. economy’s expansion “could go on for years.”
*****
&gt; “If you look at the American economy, the consumer is in good shape, balance sheets are in good shape, people are going back to the workforce, companies have plenty of capital,” Dimon told analysts during a conference call. J.P. Morgan stock rose sharply, after its record profits beat analysts’ expectations.
*****
&gt; “Positive guidance, that’s what the market needs. [The S&amp;P] could cross 2,900, but then again it could pull back,” said Krosby, but she said the momentum has been pointing higher. “The market has basically been endorsing 2,900 and beyond.”
*****
&gt; Krosby said important upcoming economic reports include Empire State and Philadelphia Fed surveys Monday and Thursday respectively, for a current look at manufacturing activity in New York and the Mid-Atlantic region. There is also industrial production and retail sales Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “Jobs data was strong. Everybody was really negative on the economy, and now we’re getting pleasant surprises,” said Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex chief market strategist. The economy added 196,000 jobs in March, bringing the monthly average to 180,000 over the past three months, even with February’s shockingly low 33,000 payrolls.
*****
&gt; Chandler said industrial production and other data should show an improved trend over last month.
*****
&gt; As stocks have shaken off growth fears, bond yields have also moved higher. The 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.55% Friday, well above the lows of 2.34% reached on March 28.

# Typical April Trading: Mid-Month Surge Stronger Second Half

&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA. April ranks #3 S&amp;P 500, #5 for NASDAQ, #2 for Russell 1000 and #4 for Russell 2000. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.19% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.29% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is stronger over the recent 21-year period.

&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off until mid-month. Then the market tends to surge from the tenth to the fifteenth trading days. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest.

&gt; Except for DJIA weighed down by Boeing (BA), stocks are having an above average month so far, which is quite typical in Pre-Election years where April has tended to be even stronger.

# Claims Bode Well For Equities

&gt; Earlier today on our Twitter account, we retweeted a chart from Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal of inverted Jobless Claims versus the S&amp;P 500. We have used this chart as an argument for the bullish case for the past several years. As we mentioned in a blog post this morning, Initial Jobless Claims came in earlier this week with a sizable drop off, down to 196K versus last week's revised 204K and expectations of 210K. This week's print was not only a new low for the current cycle, it is also the lowest reading since 1969. That sort of new low could be a good sign for equities. As shown in the chart below, claims and the S&amp;P have mirrored each other since bottoming following the financial crisis. (In the chart, we have inverted claims on the right axis.) As the S&amp;P 500 inches its way back towards all time highs, so has claims towards new lows. Additionally, with recent low prints for claims bucking what had previously appeared to be an upside trend reversal, the bullish case for the S&amp;P 500 is growing.

# Optimism Growing Again

&gt; The American Association of Individual Investors updated their weekly investor sentiment survey this morning and the results are very similar to the final days of February with bullish sentiment around 40%, bearish down near 20%, and neutral once again in the upper 30's. Up from 35.02% last week, bullish sentiment has crossed back over the 40% threshold; the first time it has done so since the previously mentioned week in February. While bullish sentiment is sitting a couple of points above the historical average, this is still several percentage points from reaching any sort of extreme level (more than one standard deviation above the aforementioned average). For that to happen, bullish sentiment would have to come in above 48.36%. If that occurs, then it could be a sign that investors are getting a little too optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bullish-Sentiment.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment, on the other hand, fell all the way back down to 20.38% this week, the lowest since its 20% reading on February 28th. That is around 10% less than the historical average for bearish sentiment. That is also at the lower end of the range bearish sentiment has stayed within in the past decade.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has still yet to have moved above or below the upper 30's coming in at 39.33% this week after falling from similar levels down to 36.71% last week. That is the third time in the past month that neutral sentiment has come in between 39% and 40%.

# The December Low Indicator Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; After the best first quarter for the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1998, the big question is: What happens next? We’ve already discussed why a good start to a year could lead to more gains (here and here), but today we will take a look at another potentially positive signal.

&gt; The December Low Indicator was created in the 1970s by Lucien Hooper, a former Forbes columnist and Wall Street analyst. Simply put, the indicator says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter, it’s a warning sign for potential weakness over the balance of the year. The flipside is if it doesn’t, good times could be coming. Given the S&amp;P 500 just went all of the first quarter without closing beneath the December 24 low, it’s worth taking a deeper dive.

&gt; Sure enough, there appears to be some truth to this concept. “The December low indicator seems quite simple, but it has a tremendous track record,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows throughout the first quarter, the full year has been higher an incredible 34 out of the last 34 times, which bodes well for 2019.” In fact, this warning even worked last year, as it triggered in the first quarter of 2018 and eventually played out during the big fourth quarter sell-off.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, when the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows in the first quarter, the full year does quite well.

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 15th, 2019.

# **Some optimistic corporate outlooks in the week ahead could lift the stock market to a record  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/get-ready-for-companies-to-tell-you-more-about-the-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s now up to corporate America to reveal whether the U.S. economy simply hit a soft patch this winter, as many suspect, or is on the verge of falling into an even deeper rut.
*****
&gt; Earnings from a broad swath of industries, like financials, technology, transportation and consumer products roll out in the coming week as the first-quarter earnings season gets underway. According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline 2.3 percent in the first negative quarter in three years, but it is business leaders’ comments on the future outlook that are even more important.
*****
&gt; Commentary and guidance is always a big deal, but this quarter it is critical. Analysts do not agree on whether the first quarter earnings season represents the trough, or even whether the second quarter will see a gain or decline in profit growth.
*****
&gt; At the same time, economic data, like March’s jobs report, are beginning to turn more positive, and first quarter growth has quickly gone from forecasts of nearly flattish back in January to now around 2%, on the back of better March releases. The economic data has been uneven, in part because of the government shutdown, but it has yet to prove the economy is back on track.
*****
&gt; “The market has been very sensitive to data that’s been picking up. The market is reflecting that, even though there’s talk of an earnings recession. What you don’t want is an earnings recession leading to an economic recession. If companies believe there’s a major downturn in revenue growth, they stop spending and ultimately they fire people and that leads to a recession,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; The stock market is also at an important inflection point, with the major indexes closing in on all-time highs. The S&amp;P 500 pressed through 2,900 Friday, seen as a point of psychological resistance. The S&amp;P ended the week at 2,907, for a weekly gain of 0.5%. The next target traders are watching is the closing high 2,930 on the S&amp;P. The all-time high was an intraday 2,940, reached on Sept. 21.
*****
&gt; Earnings season got off to a good start with J.P. Morgan Chase’s quarterly earnings report Friday. CEO Jamie Dimon was very positive, saying the U.S. economy’s expansion “could go on for years.”
*****
&gt; “If you look at the American economy, the consumer is in good shape, balance sheets are in good shape, people are going back to the workforce, companies have plenty of capital,” Dimon told analysts during a conference call. J.P. Morgan stock rose sharply, after its record profits beat analysts’ expectations.
*****
&gt; “Positive guidance, that’s what the market needs. [The S&amp;P] could cross 2,900, but then again it could pull back,” said Krosby, but she said the momentum has been pointing higher. “The market has basically been endorsing 2,900 and beyond.”
*****
&gt; Krosby said important upcoming economic reports include Empire State and Philadelphia Fed surveys Monday and Thursday respectively, for a current look at manufacturing activity in New York and the Mid-Atlantic region. There is also industrial production and retail sales Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “Jobs data was strong. Everybody was really negative on the economy, and now we’re getting pleasant surprises,” said Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex chief market strategist. The economy added 196,000 jobs in March, bringing the monthly average to 180,000 over the past three months, even with February’s shockingly low 33,000 payrolls.
*****
&gt; Chandler said industrial production and other data should show an improved trend over last month.
*****
&gt; As stocks have shaken off growth fears, bond yields have also moved higher. The 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.55% Friday, well above the lows of 2.34% reached on March 28.

# Typical April Trading: Mid-Month Surge Stronger Second Half

&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA. April ranks #3 S&amp;P 500, #5 for NASDAQ, #2 for Russell 1000 and #4 for Russell 2000. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.19% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.29% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is stronger over the recent 21-year period.

&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off until mid-month. Then the market tends to surge from the tenth to the fifteenth trading days. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest.

&gt; Except for DJIA weighed down by Boeing (BA), stocks are having an above average month so far, which is quite typical in Pre-Election years where April has tended to be even stronger.

# Claims Bode Well For Equities

&gt; Earlier today on our Twitter account, we retweeted a chart from Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal of inverted Jobless Claims versus the S&amp;P 500. We have used this chart as an argument for the bullish case for the past several years. As we mentioned in a blog post this morning, Initial Jobless Claims came in earlier this week with a sizable drop off, down to 196K versus last week's revised 204K and expectations of 210K. This week's print was not only a new low for the current cycle, it is also the lowest reading since 1969. That sort of new low could be a good sign for equities. As shown in the chart below, claims and the S&amp;P have mirrored each other since bottoming following the financial crisis. (In the chart, we have inverted claims on the right axis.) As the S&amp;P 500 inches its way back towards all time highs, so has claims towards new lows. Additionally, with recent low prints for claims bucking what had previously appeared to be an upside trend reversal, the bullish case for the S&amp;P 500 is growing.

# Optimism Growing Again

&gt; The American Association of Individual Investors updated their weekly investor sentiment survey this morning and the results are very similar to the final days of February with bullish sentiment around 40%, bearish down near 20%, and neutral once again in the upper 30's. Up from 35.02% last week, bullish sentiment has crossed back over the 40% threshold; the first time it has done so since the previously mentioned week in February. While bullish sentiment is sitting a couple of points above the historical average, this is still several percentage points from reaching any sort of extreme level (more than one standard deviation above the aforementioned average). For that to happen, bullish sentiment would have to come in above 48.36%. If that occurs, then it could be a sign that investors are getting a little too optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bullish-Sentiment.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment, on the other hand, fell all the way back down to 20.38% this week, the lowest since its 20% reading on February 28th. That is around 10% less than the historical average for bearish sentiment. That is also at the lower end of the range bearish sentiment has stayed within in the past decade.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has still yet to have moved above or below the upper 30's coming in at 39.33% this week after falling from similar levels down to 36.71% last week. That is the third time in the past month that neutral sentiment has come in between 39% and 40%.

# The December Low Indicator Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; After the best first quarter for the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1998, the big question is: What happens next? We’ve already discussed why a good start to a year could lead to more gains (here and here), but today we will take a look at another potentially positive signal.

&gt; The December Low Indicator was created in the 1970s by Lucien Hooper, a former Forbes columnist and Wall Street analyst. Simply put, the indicator says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter, it’s a warning sign for potential weakness over the balance of the year. The flipside is if it doesn’t, good times could be coming. Given the S&amp;P 500 just went all of the first quarter without closing beneath the December 24 low, it’s worth taking a deeper dive.

&gt; Sure enough, there appears to be some truth to this concept. “The December low indicator seems quite simple, but it has a tremendous track record,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows throughout the first quarter, the full year has been higher an incredible 34 out of the last 34 times, which bodes well for 2019.” In fact, this warning even worked last year, as it triggered in the first quarter of 2018 and eventually played out during the big fourth quarter sell-off.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, when the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows in the first quarter, the full year does quite well.

China Mobile has over 925 million customers, accounting for the majority of industry market share. It is the third largest company by market share in China at 200 billion.

China Mobile maintains a dominant position in the market and primarily continues to grow revenue through increased smartphone adoption and subsequent wireless data sales. In 2018 China saw 390 million smartphones shipped to domestic market. While competition in China remains fierce, China Mobile is expected to see close to 4% YoY increase in revenue per user for its mobile wireless business. Nationally, the China wireless market is near saturated, with total market customer growth at 4% in 2018. In addition to this, China Mobile is seeing growth in market share of the domestic wireless broadband business, currently at 26%. Downside risks include the ability of China Mobile to retain traditional landline and voice customers, as well as the possibility of efforts by the Chinese government to increase the competitiveness of its rivals. 

China Mobile is also advantageously positioned regarding the future of 5G. China Mobile has conducted 5G trials in 17 cities and plans to bring the business to market full scale by 2020. As the largest existing provider by far, China Mobile will enjoy several meaningful competitive advantages in the race to acquire 5G customers. The Chinese Government has also expressed interest in promoting the expansion of the 5G network, a priority they see in further shifting the nation towards a digitized services economy.

Regarding its valuation, China Mobile currently trades at a P/E of 11.5, Price/Sales of 1.81, and Price/Book of 1.3. This is lower than most industry peers. Sales per share is the highest on record at $27.17, as is book value per share at $37.36. Gross profit sits at 60.8%, with net profit at 15.9%. China Mobile has no outstanding debt and a stable 4.2% dividend at $2.05 a share. China Mobile is a mature company, with a steady dividend payout at roughly half of earnings. Capex has been disciplined, with a 6% reduction in 2018 and a further expected reduction of 10% in 2019. In the decade beginning 2020, Capex is expected to pick up significantly for several years as 5G becomes increasingly widespread. This increase in cost is expected to be tempered however by a better mix of 4G/3G customers by this timeframe, as the realization of profit through capital invested in a more expansive 4G network begins to take affect. China Mobile also shows cash per share of $12.8, accounting for over a quarter of market cap. This puts the effective P/E at 8.5, roughly half that of the industry peer group.

China Mobile currently trades at $49.14 per share, down from month ago highs at $55.84. China Mobile appears to have reached support along the 200 day moving average, with no break below this level and an increase in volume followed by declining selling volume. Despite this recent sell off however, China Mobile remains in a primary uptrend established in July of 2017. At the current valuation, still below that of the 5 year average for P/E, P/S, P/B, and P/Cash Flow, China Mobile appears undervalued with 15% upside to its recent ATH and a very real growth runway going forward. The seemingly stable 4.2% dividend yield is a worthwhile addition as well.

All information is as of market close 4/12/19.

Disney on Thursday announced its much-anticipated streaming platform Disney+, and Chairman and CEO Bob Iger claimed its company’s brand name gives it an edge over rival streaming service Netflix.

However, some analysts covering the streaming space are doubtful of Disney+’s ability to disrupt Netflix’s dominant position.

* U.S. stock futures were higher this morning. The Dow remains on track for its first losing week in three, but the Nasdaq is on track for a third straight positive week and the S&amp;P 500 is likely to do the same by moving into positive territory for the week at the open. (CNBC)
* European stocks edge higher amid investor caution over global growth (CNBC)
* Chevron (CVX) announced plans this morning to acquire oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum (APC) in a cash and stock deal the company valued at $33 billion. Shares of Anadarko surged to 30% in pre-market trading following the news. Chevron shares were down about 2%. (CNBC)
* The fate of today's trading may be altered - or bolstered - by key earnings reports out this morning. Those reports will come from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), with PNC Financial (PNC) also scheduled to report before the opening bell. There are no reports after today's closing bell. (CNBC)

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

This analysis will use three indicators (SMA 10, MACD, SlowStochastic) on a 15-year chart with monthly candles as proposed by Phil Town. These indicators can give independent BUY/SELL signals, but we will use the three in harmony with each other for a concrete signal. It is important to note we only recognize a signal once the month has ended and the candle is completed. The SMA 10 signals are quite simple. If price action ends the month above the SMA, the security issues a BUY signal, and vice versa, if price action ends the month below the SMA, it issues a SELL signal. The MACD is fairly simple as well. When the histogram turns green, a BUY signal is issued, but when it turns red, a SELL signal is issued. The Slow Stochastic indicator can be a bit trickier to understand. A cross above 80 is always considered as a BUY signal, while a cross below 20 is always considered a SELL signal. The phantom zone is described as being between 20 and 80. When in the phantom zone, the signal takes on whatever the other two indicators issue. When all three signals issue a BUY or a SELL at the same time, we can use these signals execute trades.

2018 started off with all three indicators giving off positive BUY signals (price action above SMA, MACD = green, Slow Stochastic above phantom zone). The MACD turned red in April 2018 while price action breached the SMA multiple times from February through May. However, the price action never ENDED the month below the SMA until October 2018, issuing a SELL signal for this indicator. Since the Slow Stochastic entered the phantom zone while the SMA and MACD were at SELL, its signal changes to SELL as well. Hence, all three indicators issue a SELL as of October 2018. Price action this February ended above the SMA, issuing a BUY signal for this indicator, continuing into march. However, the MACD and Slow Stochastic still remain at SELL as of the end of March 2019. I learned to used these indicators together through Phil Town.

I've been wanting to cash out my shares, but the company has not offered any purchase offers for shareholder to allow me to do so. From the info I've gathered recently, the next company purchase offer will be for new employees hired after December 2018(no idea why), but not for any other employees or former employees. 

I'm not at all familiar with how this stuff works, does anyone know if I have any other options to sell my shares? I've contacted a company that offers secondary sales, but they said that in the past, SpaceX would not allow secondary sales of shares. This situation is a bit confusing to me because from what i understand, only SpaceX employees can own and obtain SpaceX shares. And since i am no longer an employee there, i was told before that they will want to buy my shares back.

But I've recieved information that the company does not have any plans to offer purchase offers to former or current employees. I paid alot of taxes on the shares I own while I was employed there, and now it sounds like they have no intention or plan to buy back shares or allow anyone to sell their shares. 

Just super confused and frustrated, can anyone shed some light on my situation, and possibly give me information on what I can do to cash out my shares?

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 65 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the last major updates I have been working on backtesting and refining my strategy according to the results. Essentially what I settled on is running every stock on my list for the past two years, predicting the price 10 days out, and comparing against the actual data. I then prioritize by the true positive rate over the false negative rate, times the average size of gains over the average size of loss. 

&amp;#x200B;

Adjusted for alpha\*g/l... (TP= true positive rate, and so on... alpha = TP/FN, avg G/l = mean gain / mean loss, glf = number of gain days / number of loss days, perf = performance = alpha/glf, N = number of data points)

Note that I defined alpha here in an unconventional manner. A traditional alpha (relative to market performance) would be alpha/glf. Essentially this boils down to if you follow this strategy, your gains to losses will be alpha\*G/l. If you left your money in the market all the time your gain to loss ratio would be glf\*G/l. One kind of interesting finding is that different days of the week have different performance, with Thursday typically being the best (hence shifting these posts to Thursday).

&amp;#x200B;

The major take away from this: alpha is typically higher than the number of gain to loss days, meaning that we have beat the market on average by following this strategy (a traditional alpha here would be 1.56/1.31=1.13, or 13% better than leaving your money in all the time in the same stocks). I think this is decent, but obviously can be improved. I'd be glad to hear your ideas and criticism

Context: Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) manufactures different propulsion systems for rockets and other aerospace applications. On Tuesday, short seller Spruce Point Capital came out with a pretty damaging report and the stock initially dropped about 12% before gaining most of it back before close, to down about 2-3%.  Today, AJRD closed down about 2% before dropping another 3.5% after market close for 5.5% total decline on Wednesday. 

Spruce Point's report alleged that analysts covering the stock don't put much thought into long-term growth problems, losing business to cheaper options such as SpaceX and Blue Origin and issues with the board/management being involved with fraudulent companies prior to their tenure with AJRD. But in my opinion, the most troubling point was accusations of ""aggressive"" accounting practices regarding revenue recognition and certain aspects of their balance sheet which analysts don't account for. 

These balance sheet entries are about $900M worth of liabilities which Spruce Point claims when added back in, make AJRD about five times as levered as they appear to the markets.  

Now, Spruce Point is a firm with a short position against AJRD so they're doing what a short seller is supposed to. Personally I wasnt worried about the stock dropping since I'm in it for the long term, but this report does point out a lot of potential long-term issues that could affect the stock in the long term.  Short seller reports come out all the time but I feel like a lot of the time they're common with love-to-hate stocks like Tesla, whereas it doesnt happen as often with lesser-known stocks like AJRD. 

I want to hear opinions from others who may understand the situation better than I or understand the industry's trends as a whole as well. Do Spruce Point's arguments make sense? Do their short calls typically ring true? Does AJRD seem to be participating in fraudulent activities or is everything in-line with accounting standards? Thanks to anyone who reads this. 

TL;DR: short-seller Spruce Point released a very negative report on AJRD on Tuesday. Report highlights short term and long term issues.

The Fed’s policy-making committee voted unanimously against bolstering the economy by cutting interest rates, and several officials praised what they described as the decision to let Lehman fail, saying it would help to restore a sense of accountability on Wall Street.

James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, urged his colleagues “to wait for some time to assess the impact of the Lehman bankruptcy filing, if any, on the national economy,” according to transcripts of the Fed’s 2008 meetings that it published on Friday.

The hundreds of pages of transcripts, based on recordings made at the time, reveal the ignorance of Fed officials about economic conditions during the climactic months of the financial crisis. Officials repeatedly fretted about overstimulating the economy, only to realize time and again that they needed to redouble efforts to contain the crisis.

The Fed’s chairman at the time, Ben S. Bernanke, was unusually clearsighted in warning of the risk of a severe recession as the nation entered into a presidential election year. But he struggled to persuade his colleagues, and at crucial junctures he did not push forcefully for stronger action.

The Fed’s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was even more alarmed by the deterioration of economic conditions. She and Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, are the most forceful and persistent advocates for stronger action in the transcripts. But they, too, underestimated the downturn until the final months of 2008.

The transcripts also show, however, that Fed officials responded decisively in those final months, probably preventing an even deeper recession. By the end of 2008, the Fed had reduced short-term interest rates nearly to zero for the first time since the Great Depression, and it had become a primary source of funding not just for the global financial system but for American homeowners and for companies that made food and cars.

Ms. Yellen summed up this new ethos at a Fed meeting six weeks after Lehman’s failure, telling colleagues, “Given the seriousness of the situation, I believe that we should put as much stimulus into the system as we can as soon as we can.”

In normal times, the Fed is a powerful but somnolent institution, charged with keeping a steady hand on the rudder of the economy. It moves interest rates up and down to moderate inflation and minimize unemployment. But beginning in 2007, it was forced to take on a far more challenging role as the central backstop for the global financial system.

The Fed’s understanding of the crisis, however, was clouded by its reliance on indicators that tend to miss sharp changes in conditions. The government initially estimated, for example, that the economy expanded in the first half of 2008 because it basically assumed that some economic trends, like the pace of business creation, had continued apace. The Fed also relied on economic models that assumed the existence of smoothly functioning financial markets, limiting its ability to project the consequences of a breakdown. And the outlook of Fed officials also reflected a deeply ingrained bias to worry more about the risk of inflation than the reality of rising unemployment.

As Fed officials gathered on Sept. 16 at their marble headquarters in Washington for a previously scheduled meeting, stock markets were in free fall. Housing prices had been collapsing for two years, and unemployment was climbing.

Yet most officials did not see clear evidence of a broad crisis. They expected the economy to grow slowly in 2008 and then more quickly in 2009.

The transcript for that meeting contains 129 mentions of “inflation” and five of “recession.”

Mr. Bernanke even told his colleagues that it was clear the economy had entered a downturn but that he still did not favor cutting rates.

“I think that our policy is looking actually pretty good,” he said.

That optimism would not long endure. Just minutes after the end of that first meeting, a smaller group of Fed officials agreed to rescue the faltering insurance giant the American International Group, a company never before subject to Fed supervision that until then was barely on the government’s radar.

In the succeeding weeks, as evidence of a downturn became unmistakable, the Fed would announce a seemingly endless series of programs to buttress the economy, leading Fed officials to joke about the resulting alphabet soup of acronyms.

In early October, a few weeks after the decision to stand pat, the Fed convened an unscheduled meeting to cut interest rates in an action coordinated with other major central banks.

“It’s more than obvious that we have an extraordinary situation,” Mr. Bernanke told colleagues.

“I should say that this comes as a surprise to me,” he said. “I very much expected that we could stay at 2 percent for a long time, and then when the economy began to recover, we could begin to normalize interest rates. But clearly things have gone off in a direction that is quite worrisome.”

He closed on a prescient note, telling the committee that he did not expect that monetary policy could solve the problem, but that the Fed should not be hesitant to use the tools that it had.

By the end of the year, the Fed had cut interest rates nearly to zero and started to buy mortgage bonds in a further effort to stimulate the housing market and the broader economy. More than five years later, it is still pursuing both policies even as the economic recovery remains incomplete.

Some Fed officials have argued that the Fed was blind in 2008 because it relied, like everyone else, on a standard set of economic indicators.

As late as August 2008, “there were no clear signs that many financial firms were about to fail catastrophically,” Mr. Bullard said in a November presentation in Arkansas that the St. Louis Fed recirculated on Friday. “There was a reasonable case that the U.S. could continue to ‘muddle through.’ ”

Within weeks, Mr. Bernanke also began to insist that the failure of Lehman could not have been prevented without changes in federal law. Furthermore, some officials began to argue that the importance of the failure had been overstated because the economy was already falling apart.

“The whole framing, which seems to have hardened now, that the world ended with the Lehman bankruptcy is just deeply unfair to the basic truth,” Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said at an October meeting. “Independent of whether there was an option available at the time, the erosion in underlying economic conditions and in confidence in the future outlook was powerful and substantial going into August and early September.”

The Fed entered the year on edge. Officials did not know that the economy already was in recession, but Mr. Bernanke and his closest advisers worried that the Fed’s initial response to the financial crisis at the end of 2007 had been insufficient, and that tumbling stock prices were the beginning of a broader pullback.

Mr. Bernanke hoped to delay any action until the first scheduled meeting of 2008 in late January, but over the three-day Martin Luther King weekend, he concluded that the Fed could not wait. He convened a conference call at 6 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 21, and won agreement to cut the Fed’s benchmark interest rate 0.75 percentage point, the largest cut in more than two decades.

“The risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high,” Ms. Yellen said at the meeting.

Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said this week that the decision was an awakening. “If maybe we were a little slow to recognize what was happening, Martin Luther King weekend in January 2008 was a decisive point in terms of interest rate policy,” he said.

By early March, the Fed was moving to replace investors as a source of funding for Wall Street.

Financial firms, particularly in the mortgage business, were beginning to fail because they could not borrow money. Investors had lost confidence in their ability to predict which loans would be repaid. Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, sold itself for a relative pittance to Bank of America. Bear Stearns, one of the largest packagers and sellers of mortgage-backed securities, was teetering toward collapse.

On March 7, the Fed offered companies up to $200 billion in funding. Three days later, Mr. Bernanke secured the Fed policy-making committee’s approval to double that amount to $400 billion, telling his colleagues, “We live in a very special time.”

Finally, on March 16, the Fed effectively removed any limit on Wall Street funding even as it arranged the Bear Stearns rescue.

And then the Fed paused. By the end of April, it had cut short-term rates to 2 percent from 5.25 percent the previous September — one of the fastest falls in Fed history — and officials said they had done enough to shore up the financial system. They predicted that the economy would narrowly avoid a recession.

“I think it is very possible that we will look back and say, particularly after the Bear Stearns episode, that we have turned the corner in terms of the financial disruption that we have just experienced,” Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, said during a meeting at the end of April.

The summer passed relatively quietly. Officials began to fret about inflation. The transcripts include long conversations about when the Fed should start to raise interest rates.

“We saw growth of about 2 percent in the second quarter, which suggests a campaign slogan for the Republicans, ‘The Economy: It Could Be Worse,” Mr. Bernanke joked in early August.

But it was only the eye of the storm. By the third week of September, it was clear that Mr. Bernanke was right: Things could be worse. The financial crisis had arrived, as Ernest Hemingway once wrote of bankruptcy, “Gradually and then suddenly.”

Saudi Aramco’s debut international bond sale drew $100bn of investor orders for the initial $10bn available to buy, smashing records for an emerging-market bond sale. How does that imbalance between orders and allocations happen, and what does it mean?

How does a company issue a bond?

In this case, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are the global co-ordinators, meaning they are running the show. Citi, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and NCB Capital Company are helping out as “joint bookrunners”.

A so-called roadshow was held last week, where bankers and Saudi Aramco executives travelled around the globe to talk to investors, answer questions and drum up demand.

Bankers provide the first suggestions of how much the bond will yield and in turn, investors respond with early indications of interest — a sort of hypothetical order to buy the bond if the final price matches what the bankers had said. By the end of last week those indicative orders had reached about $30bn.

So, the banks’ work is done?

Not quite. The next step for the bankers is to firm up the price. They send out a summary to investors with details about each chunk of the bond, its maturity and its likely price. This is known as initial price talk.

Investors now submit fresh offers to buy the bond — and how much of it they want. But here is where it gets tricky, as Paul McNamara, investment director at GAM, a Swiss-based asset manager, points out.

Investors already know there are more investors wanting to buy the bond than the banks can sell to. As a result, investors routinely ask for more than they actually want, expecting the banks to sell them only a sliver of their order. “Once you get into a cycle where the order book is seen as reflective of demand, it creates demand in its own right,” says Mr McNamara.

Which investors get what?

It depends on who you are and what you are asking for. If you are a large and important client to the bank selling the bond, then you are more likely to get what you want. Similarly, if you are asking for just a small amount, it is easier to fulfil that order.

Investors say small and midsized fund managers who want to buy a decent amount are often stuck. “It’s like game theory in a way for us, as a medium-sized client,” says Mr McNamara of GAM, which had about $130bn of assets at the end of last year. “We have a final amount we’d like to get. But someone like Pimco or the big sovereign wealth funds will get a better allocation because of their size and the fact that they are regarded as strong hands that won’t try to flip the bond” if the price rises.

Doesn’t this complicate things for the banks?

Rampant overbidding is a nice problem to have. Part of the solution is to tweak the deal terms.

If orders really pile up, banks tend to increase the amount to be borrowed or improve the price for the borrower, or both, trying to let demand more closely match what is on offer. If this happens, investors can change their order or drop out. For Aramco’s deal, banks increased the size of the deal from $10bn to $12bn while also lowering the interest rate paid to investors.

Banks, often in close consultation with the issuer, must choose who gets what. In the case of Saudi Aramco, a key reason for issuing the bond — bearing in mind that the company does not need the money — was to ingratiate itself with investors at a time when the country is stung by controversy over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

For that reason, banks may look to include as many investors in the deal as possible, rather than prioritising larger buyers.

“It’s tricky for any issuer that comes to the market for the first time,” says Tim Jagger, head of emerging market debt at Columbia Threadneedle. “They want to get the lowest cost of funds possible but they are also entering a new relationship with investors.”

Bruce Isackson this week pled guilty to paying a $250,000 bribe to get his kid into UCLA. But rather than cash like so many others involved, he paid in Facebook stock. In 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing how much Facebook has grown since then, I decided to calculate the value of the stock if he had held onto it. If he had held it at peak Facebook, just two years after he paid the bribe, the stock would have been worth more than $460,000. Obviously we aren't at peak Facebook anymore, so that value has declined to $360,000. But still, that's a nice return. And it's a lot better than jail time.

I'm new to investing, and I'm having a hard time wrapping my small brain around some of the tax aspects of earnings.  And my question is so specific, I can't seem to find any answers through research.

I understand that long term capital gains are taxed at 15% and short term capital gains are taxed at normal income tax rates.  

Let's say I have 500 shares in a company stock.  Ideally, I want to hold these for 1 year +1 day to avoid paying income tax.  But I decide to sell 100 of the shares early and pay the income tax.  Then a few days later I buy the shares back (hopefully at a profit).  

So I'm back to 500 shares.  

Fast forward a year, I've owned 400 shares for a year and a day, and 100 shares for less than a year.  So my question: If I sell 400 of my shares in the company, will they all be considered LTCGs or will I also be paying a portion in STCGs.
