* Stock futures were under some pressure today, despite optimism over U.S.-China trade talks. The Nasdaq was riding an eight-session winning streak. Stocks, while off to a strong start this year, remain well below record highs after their late 2018 rout. (CNBC)
* The U.S. and China have started to outline commitments in principle on the stickiest issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. (Reuters)
* China may be on the cusp of introducing 'more aggressive' stimulus measures: Economists (CNBC)
* Three economic reports are out at 8:30 a.m. ET, with the Labor Department issuing its weekly report on initial jobless claims, the Commerce Department releasing its shutdown-delayed December report on durable goods orders, and the Philadelphia Fed putting out its February manufacturing index. (CNBC)
* Fed's Bullard: Rate hikes, balance sheet reduction 'coming to an end' (CNBC)
* Fed signals, in latest meeting minutes, an end date for balance sheet reduction (CNBC)
* Earnings reports out this morning include the latest numbers from Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Wendy's (WEN). After-the-bell reports today include Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intuit (INTU), Kraft Heinz (KHC), and Zillow Group (ZG). (CNBC)
* Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would ""swiftly"" pass a measure that would block President Donald Trump's national emergency order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, setting the stage for a fierce debate in the GOP-controlled Senate. (WSJ)
* Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen is set to testify in a public hearing before lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled House next Wednesday, and the panel's chairman said Trump's business practices would be a focus of the testimony. (Reuters)
* A federal judge in Washington ordered Roger Stone to appear in court today after the longtime Trump ally posted a photo on social media this weekend showing the judge next to crosshairs. Stone's lawyers apologized for the ""improper photograph and comment."" (Yahoo Finance)
* Apple (AAPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS) plan to start issuing this spring a joint credit card paired with new iPhone features that will help users manage their money. The card will be rolled out to employees for testing in the next few weeks and officially launch later this year. (WSJ)
* Samsung's new foldable smartphone is a ""game-changer,"" but investors should not expect the new device to be a major contributor to the company's profits this year, according analysts. Samsung unveiled a flexible display prototype back in 2011. (CNBC)
* Lyft plans to launch the roadshow for its initial public offering during the week of March 18, making it the first U.S. ride-hailing company to debut in the stock market. Lyft's larger rival Uber still needs several more weeks for its IPO preparations. (Reuters)

* Puma deletes poor-taste tweet about Williamson's Nike shoe mishap (USA Today)
* ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, who told Chicago police he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in January, has been charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He's expected to have a bond hearing today. (USA Today)

A few funds also sold their stakes though only one is notable. Josh Resnick was building up his position in NFLX for the past few quarters but sold it all in Q4. The hedge fund trades on NFLX can be found [here](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/NFLX).

I've been considering a (small) long entry but the stock is trading like 15% away from its all-time high so I'm waiting for a dip. Anyone else have more thoughts on this? Their subscriber growth numbers were strong and with the price hike they should be raking in more revenue.

From a Free Cash Flow and Growth standpoint, I find BECN to be a solid buy on dips. The current cash flows produced by this company are very undervalued. 5-year average cash flows are also undervalued. Management's outlook on FY 2019 is positive.

My Strategy
I buy and hold stock until the company‚Äôs financials deteriorate, I find a better investment, or the company becomes overvalued according to my set criteria. My longest holding period has been 2 years and running. If one of my holdings goes down, I look at as an opportunity to buy more at a discount. My current holdings are BOX, ATIS, LOGM, MIK.

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The ‚ÄúNot Owned‚Äù column means: if you don‚Äôt own this  stock then you should ‚Ä¶ The ‚ÄúOwned‚Äù column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column ‚ÄúGrowth(90d)‚Äù refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column ‚ÄúTx(90d)‚Äù shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. ‚ÄúFactor‚Äù is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally ‚ÄúSuccess Rate‚Äù shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of ‚Äúlookalike‚Äù stocks as well as major ETF‚Äôs. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

HOW I USE THIS:
 For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.

**OPINION ABOUT TODAY**:
Looks like the market is still feeling contracted, and not abundant in opportunities.

Also I realize these percentages don‚Äôt add up to 100 but I currently am holding a small amount of LTC and plan on riding that up and then buying into one of my 5 stocks shown here.

* U.S.-China trade talks continue in Washington today, with President Donald Trump signaling flexibility on the March tariff cease-fire deadline. Chinese state media warned that new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would be ""catastrophic"" for global stocks. (CNBC)
* Investors get more insight into the Fed's thinking on the economy and interest rates, when the minutes from its January meeting are out at 2 p.m. ET. * Meanwhile, weekly mortgage applications rose 3.6 percent, a sign of hope for the spring home buying season. (CNBC)

* UK defense think tank warns that allowing Huawei into 5G network is 'irresponsible' (CNBC)

Spy has had a ton of volatility the last few months, went down to the low 230s and has now bounced all the way back up to high 270s.  

Politically things in the US are heating up.  It seems like each week one of trumps campaign managers are getting indicted.  Additionally the trade war with China and possibly Europe.  

These are leaving some huge ifs in the market right now.   With spy at 278 it is only 5-6% from all time highs.  I just don‚Äôt see the risk / reward in buying right now when the potential downside is probably 2-5x the upside.  I‚Äôm not saying to short the market, but I find the intense buying in the 270s interesting.  I see stocks hitting all time highs, but overall it just seems like a very risky time to buy something at an all time high.  Even buying spy 5% from ATH seems like a bad investment right now.

Also it seems like the fed not increasing rates has a lot of people feeling bullish.  Why does this have so much impact ? 

Posting this because maybe there is a lot of potential upside that I am just not seeing.  Maybe someone can convince me otherwise...

Seems to be one of the (if not the) most popular online banking institution.  Over the past 6 months they had a pretty steep decline from the $40s to the high $20s.  Their most recent earnings report shows them to be on track for some really strong growth in the short term future.  They seem to have made a good many acquisitions and purchased a lot of deposits from other institutions which basically allows them to manage a sizable portion of their debt in a low interest manner.

I feel like their valuation from several months back in the $40s is very reasonable given their fundamentals.  My initial position began in December at $28.26.  They currently sit at $32.69 after their 2018q4 report.  Trying to think of reasons why I‚Äôm not pouring money into my holding.  Would appreciate any insight from others who are following $AX.

I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The ‚ÄúNot Owned‚Äù column means: if you don‚Äôt own this  stock then you should ‚Ä¶ The ‚ÄúOwned‚Äù column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column ‚ÄúGrowth(90d)‚Äù refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column ‚ÄúTx(90d)‚Äù shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. ‚ÄúFactor‚Äù is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally ‚ÄúSuccess Rate‚Äù shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on. \n\nMany people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of ‚Äúlookalike‚Äù stocks as well as major ETF‚Äôs. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.\n\n\n**HOW I USE THIS**:\n For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn\'t bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn\'t actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don\'t like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.\n\n\n**OPINION ABOUT TODAY**:\nSince there were only two companies returned by the system and both are not in ready_to_buy state, I would recommend being very careful about trading these stocks, they probably have had a good run and may be getting closer to plateau.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/dsKp21J""&gt;Link to imgur with screeshots to picks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a financier or economist.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Results have missed analyst estimates, guidance has been reduced and a Spruce Point report in December accused XPO of ""financial irregularities"". But unless there is real financial fraud going on, which seems unlikely, the sell-off looks like an opportunity.


Each of the events to hit the company are beyond XPO‚Äôs control and the company has handled them all admirably. With a slowdown in France and the UK, the bankruptcy of a major customer and its largest customer (probably Amazon) withdrawing the bulk of its revenues in the fourth quarter.  The question arises as to what other company could withstand such headwinds and still report 2018 revenue/EBITDA growth of 12.3%/14.3% and forecast 2019 revenue/EBITDA growth of 4%-6%/6%-10%?


The allegations of financial irregularities have been largely written off by the markets after XPO said the report was ""intentionally misleading"" and had ""significant inaccuracies,"".  Whilst these sort of things are difficult to dismiss entirely, for me the accusations do not ring true.  Firstly, I take comfort from the reputation and achievements of CEO Brad Jacobs (google his name to see what I mean).  Secondly, the behavior of the company in building cash balances and paying down debt over the past three years is not the typical of a company in financial difficulty. 


XPO has an unparalleled lead in the crucial ""last-mile delivery"" for e-commerce supply chain.  When the smoke clears, I believe that will drive double digit growth for many years to come.  If that is the case, the current valuation at 18 times trailing earnings is missing the bigger picture.


This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are highly risky and not suitable for all investors.  Please consult with a Registered Investment Advisor.

I don‚Äôt know what classes I should take and what might be some good colleges to go too for this. I hear Alabama has a great course. But I still don‚Äôt really know what courses I should take and how to get my license. I know a lot of people intern at brokerages hoping to get a job their one day and I am planning on doing that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The fund created by Morgan Creek Digital in New York is investing in cryptocurrency giant Coinbase, which was recently valued at $8 billion, and several lesser-known startups, including Blockfi, RealBlocks, TrustToken, Harbor, Open Finance Network, CityBlock Capital, Namebase, Good Money and Digital Assets Data. As much as $4 million of the investment could eventually be used to purchase cryptocurrency directly, though that has not happened yet.

Let's say I have 100 stocks each at $10. Total cost: $1000

Earnings come up next week but it usually falls 15% after earnings. To protect my investment, can I buy a $8.50 or even $9 put? So in case the stock does drop by 15%, I can exercise my put options and be out with a minimal loss/minimal gain depending on where the stock lands? 

Just wondering what your thoughts are about this strategy. I apolozige if i got something wrong I hope you'll excuse my stupidity. Is there any other strategy you use to protect your investment during a ER that you would like to share?

A real cash machine of late, trading at a mid-single digit multiple of cash flow, with a great recovery in terms of operating efficiency. A great brand name with proprietary advantages and mindshare. Subtract out the cash and it was recently trading at about 10 times earnings. **A good holding for an 8 year old. Buy her a blueberry iMac and give her some stock** :) I bought it as a long-term holding but it's run up too. This problem of ultra-quick 30% gains despite Buffetesque intent is vexing, but not unpleasant. 

Mike's advice, if taken, would have generated a 10,291% return in the 20 years since it was given. Apple was at $1.64 on April 30, 1999 and today it is $170.42.

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 18th, 2019.

# **What to watch in the market in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/fed-could-be-back-in-play-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Fed calmed the markets in late January when it said it could stop raising interest rates, but investors are watching the release of its meeting minutes for any sign the Fed could veer off its easy path.
*****
&gt; ""It's hard to imagine the Fed sounding as dovish in the minutes, as [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell sounded in the briefing . We do think the minutes will be bearish. As far as the general tenor, it's hard to see it more dovish than it was on Jan. 30,"" said Michael Schumacher, director strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; The Fed, at that meeting, held rates steady and emphasized it could pause in its rate hiking cycle. In what felt like an about face from its December meeting, Powell also emphasized that the Fed would be flexible with its balance sheet. The Fed releases the minutes of its meeting Wednesday afternoon.
*****
&gt; Positive comments on trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, and a commitment to continue talks in the coming week helped boost stocks Friday and could continue to support the market in the week ahead. Investors were also watching for more information on a Commerce Department report, which could be viewed as a market negative if it recommended tariffs on European automobiles. The president has 90 days from this weekend to act on the report.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, even with Thursday's sell off on stunningly weak December retail sales data. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.5 percent to 2,775, and the Dow was at 25,883, up 3 percent for the week.
*****
&gt; After December retail sales slumped 1.7 percent, Walmart earnings on Tuesday will be even more important. The retail sales data was contrary to other reports from retailers and others that showed solid holiday sales, so Walmart's comments about what it is seeing now as well as during the end of the fourth quarter will be important.
*****
&gt; ""We're going to watch them very closely, and that's because of the retail sales number. The government shutdown, plus the market going down, everyone talking about a recession coming. Did people cut back spending a little bit? Was it real?"" said Vinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; Walmart's comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were expected to be up about 3 percent, and its earnings per share are expected to be flat at $1.33, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Economists cut their expectations for fourth quarter growth to under 2.5 percent after the retail sales number, which was viewed as suspect by some. Goldman Sachs economists called the report an outlier, and said that as much of 1 percentage point of the drop is unexplained.
*****
&gt; ""Some special factors likely contributed to the fall in core retail sales, including an early Thanksgiving, the December stock-market sell-off, and the start of the government shutdown,"" it said.
*****
&gt; So the coming week's data will also be important, including weekly jobless claims Thursday, which were higher for a third week this past week. The concern is that rising claims could be an early warning sign of a slowdown in the labor market.
*****
&gt; ""Unemployment claims are rising, at the same time employment growth and income growth are not suggesting this is the case,"" said Pande.
*****
&gt; Data on home builder sentiment comes out Tuesday morning, and existing home sales and unemployment claims Thursday.
*****
&gt; Pande said the market broke out in the past week from a sideways trade it fell into earlier in the month. ""Until last week, we just went back to the status quo of November,"" he said, adding the sell off in December was way overdone. The market has been at an impasse between the lift from value, and the drag from what he called the idiosyncratic risks, like trade, the shutdown threat and other geopolitical risk.
*****
&gt; ""I think the balance shifted a bit. The bad news on the idiosyncratic front is being overwhelmed by the less bad,"" Pande said.
*****
&gt; Pande said there's a risk that investors will read the Fed's minutes in the coming week a little more hawkish than it intends.
*****
&gt; There could be discussion in the minutes about the balance sheet unwind, which some traders fear has been making markets less liquid.
*****
&gt; At the Jan. 30 meeting and before, Powell had backtracked on a comment he made after the December meeting that the unwind was on ""autopilot.""
*****
&gt; ""It's not a gigantic concession to say I'm flexible. This QT was going to end at any rate at the end of the year,"" said Pande, adding ""we could misinterpret the minutes.""
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the bond market will be looking for details on which securities the Fed might be rolling off of its balance sheet and which it will be replacing with new purchases, as their holdings mature.
*****
&gt; ""We think potentially the biggest move in the bond market as far as the minutes go is the composition of the balance sheet. It's not so much the equilibrium number, or when the Fed gets there...There's been talk that the Fed should shorten the duration of its Treasurys. That should mean a steeper curve and higher long term yields,"" Schumacher said. If the Fed does signal it wants to hold shorter-duration securities, yields on the 10-year and 30-year bond could rise.

# Day After Presidents‚Äô Day: Improving, But Record Still Bearish

&gt; Yesterday we pointed out the day before Presidents‚Äô Day was amongst the poorest performing holiday over the long run. The day after is even weaker over the long run. However since 2012, the market‚Äôs performance after the long holiday weekend has improved, most notably during the last seven years with S&amp;P 500 positive in six of these years.

# Should Investors Love A Great Start to 2019?

&gt; Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day everyone! With the S&amp;P 500 Index up 9.8% for the year as of yesterday, this is its best start up to this point since 1991. So should investors love to see this much green this early in the year, or should they be leery they might be heartbroken down the road?

&gt; An old adage on Wall Street suggests, ‚ÄúAs goes January, so goes the year.‚Äù With stocks having posted their best January in more than 30 years, it‚Äôs time to take a closer look at the January barometer, first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac. Simply put, if the first month of the year is green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa).

&gt; Let‚Äôs get one thing straight‚Äîthis didn‚Äôt work last year. The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 5% in January of 2018, and it closed the year in the red. Nonetheless, the January barometer has a strong track record, and one we shouldn‚Äôt ignore.

&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the rest of the year (final 11 months) has been up 11.7% on average, well above the overall average return of 7.6% for the final 11 months of the year. However, when that first month was red, the final 11 months were up only 1.2% on average. According to LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, ‚ÄúThe January barometer isn‚Äôt perfect, but it does have a pretty solid track record. Now where things really get interesting is when that first month was up more than 7% (like in 2019), the return over the final 11 months actually became stronger.‚Äù 

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/the-january-barometer-has-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Of course, we don‚Äôt suggest investing based simply on what the first month does, but with a more accommodative Federal Reserve, fiscal policy still flowing, and likely continued better-than-expected corporate earnings growth, this is yet another sign that 2019 may see a continuation of the bull market, as we outlined previously in our Outlook 2019.

&gt; In all the instances when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7% at the end of January, the rest of the year gained five out of six times, with only 1987 negative. Still, a 10.3% return over the final 11 months implies we‚Äôd see new highs before 2019 is over. Last, be open to a pullback, as a median correction of 8.1% has happened in the past after super strong starts to the year.

# The Year of the Pig Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; ‚ÄúBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.‚Äù Old Wall Street saying.

&gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) kicked off Tuesday, February 5, and with it came the Year of the Pig. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs‚Äîit is important to note that the Year of the Pig has historically been quite strong for equities.

&gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting in late January dating all the way back to 1928.* And wouldn‚Äôt you know it? The Year of the Pig is up nearly 15% on average. Oink oink indeed!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Year-of-the-Pig-Returns-are-quite-strong.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúThe year of the pig is the twelfth of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the pig is considered a symbol of wealth in Chinese culture, which is quite interesting given some strong equity returns have taken place during this year. In fact, out of the 12 zodiac signs, no year sports a better average return,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Year-of-the-Pig-Could-have-Bulls-Happy-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Be aware that a small sample size and the pure randomness of this makes us want to stress not to ever invest purely based on the zodiac signs. Still, here‚Äôs to the year of the pig playing out for the bulls once again!

SNC is one of Canada‚Äôs largest construction and engineering firms. The company constructs infrastructure projects in oil and gas, clean energy, nuclear, mining, and public infrastructure.

The stock is down approximately 50% from its 52 week highs largely due to profit guidance being lowered from $3.60-$3.85 to $2.15 to $2.30 per share and goodwill write downs in its energy division. Profit down due to a problem infrastructure megaproject in Saudia Arabia and mounting trade tensions between Canada and the Saudis (Trudeau effect) to decrease future dealings.

Recently the stock has continued to decline due to the revelation that the Liberals including Prime Minister JTs (former backstreet boy) office pressured the handling of an SNC Lavalin corruption cases (fraud and bribery) by the Attorney General.  I have not yet read through these cases in detail and will be doing so, but in my opinion these cases are largely noise in terms of how they effect the long term value of SNC. Analysts are citing risk that SNC may be forbidden from bidding on certain govt contracts in the future as a result of the ongoing corruption cases but I think this is very unlikely due to how large the firm is and how reliant the govt is on them. However, I am more concerned about corrupt management at the helm destroying shareholder value through mismanagement and embezzlement. 

Ok so where‚Äôs the upside here?

1) SNC owns 16% (a Netherlands group owns the majority of I remember correctly) of the 407 highway that runs across southern Ontario. It is a toll highway that is often the only good option to beat heavy traffic in the region that continues to grow rapidly. It is very expensive to travel on and extremely profitable. Anecdotally my bill used to be $600 per month when I took it once a day to the office for 75km. Analysts are valuing their ownership in the 407 alone from $20-$28 dollars per share before debts. This is largely an off balance sheet asset asset as it is recorded at its book value still. 

Note: They recently borrowed $1.5 billion using 407 stake to secure a loan to complete acquisition of WS Atkins. WS Atkins a global engineering consulting firm with UK HQ for $3.6B or approximately 1X sales. This acquisition needs to be given great attention in any analysis.

2) SNC is one of Canada‚Äôs only nuclear energy firms. It therefore is essential to Canada‚Äôs national security and will continue to be protected by the govt. It‚Äôs also too big to fail and would receive govt support if it ever got into interim financial trouble.

3) Trudeau and the liberals are deeply unpopular and will almost certainly be out next year. This will help put the corruption scandal behind us - remember memories are short! Conservatives will get in and normalize relations with the Saudis.

This is very high level info only and just gives some guidance to look into SNC has a potential value play. The balance sheet needs to be examined in great deal and adjusted for assets that should be increased to FMV like 407 but also goodwill write downs due poor acquisitions (and they usually are poor).

I still like Callaway as a company, the PE and Price to Sales are good. I see future growth with their Top Golf business. 

ELY is currently one of the smaller positions in my portfolio. To cut to the chase, I'm unsure if I should purchase more shares in attempt to bring down my average cost. Or if I should just stay put and hold my position, and not purchase any more shares.

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The ‚ÄúNot Owned‚Äù column means: if you don‚Äôt own this  stock then you should ‚Ä¶ The ‚ÄúOwned‚Äù column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column ‚ÄúGrowth(90d)‚Äù refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column ‚ÄúTx(90d)‚Äù shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. ‚ÄúFactor‚Äù is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally ‚ÄúSuccess Rate‚Äù shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of ‚Äúlookalike‚Äù stocks as well as major ETF‚Äôs. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions. 



HOW I USE THIS:
For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way.  The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,323485,public,,self,Ladybaybee stock picks for2-15-2019,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aqyy4u/ladybaybee_stock_picks_for2152019/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bouncing between $1.80 to $2.74 and back in 24 hours! First off, it seems fairly valued to me at it's current $1.80's, if a little high. The run into the high $2's and back seems to be an obvious pump and dump, however independently of that I like Cormedix. 

&amp;#x200B;

They are working on Neutrolin, which fills a need and with 10 years exclusivity. There are still competitors developing alternative products however, and no one will have full market share assuming heparin and saline no longer become standard care. The new ""news"" affirms the fast track for Neutrolin. People can come to their own conclusions on the ifs and whens of FDA approval. My personal opinion is somewhere between 50% chance conservatively, and 75% chance generously. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the pump was largely due to a faulty assumption of FDA approval at a correct assumption of valuation in the $3's. My favorite pumper is Earlndunia on StockTwits, a character played like a drunk muppet who can't type but can somehow predict the future. Earl created an account in December and has exclusively only posted bullish twits about CRMD, encouraging the crowd and claimed to have 75k@.90 and insider information. For reasons I don't understand, many others seem to look to him as an Oracle. Instead of the future-seeing Oracle helping Keanu Reeves in the Matrix, picture instead Keanu Reeves from Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. Earl claimed to have a ""sorce"" and promised news of FDA approval, a buyout from pfizer, and prices of $3, $5, $6, $10, $25, and so on. People bought and as the price went up, so did the intensity of Earl's ""predictions"". After the dump, Earl posted ""stop crying only money"", which I thought was particularly well played. If people got suckered by that, shame on them, they were buying pre-approval stock at near post-approval prices. However, I wouldn't let that sour anyone on CRMD as a potential opportunity, while still not currently cheap after the dump and just fairly valued. 

&amp;#x200B;

Earl does touch on some other considerations, albeit stupidly, which include the possibility of a buyout. This seems plausible, and I could see an eventual valuation of $5 or $6 if everything aligns perfectly, but I'm not really thinking too hard on that. First things first is the odds of FDA approval and the stock price. Volatility has been pretty incredible, and I think it's reasonable that with approval the stock can spend time in the $4's even if it can't easily stay there. So if you make the same assumptions I do, that's a greater than 50% chance than a more than x2 upside at current pricing. I also think it's reasonable to have a much more pessimistic view. To those I would note the dump could continue (especially if volume dries up) creating more appealing entry points. Anyone interested I'd say don't get caught in another pump, but instead keep an eye out for clues hinting at odds of FDA approval and see how the risk balances against your own estimates of likely upside.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,323288,public,,self,$CRMD Cormedix as it should be.,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aqsdvu/crmd_cormedix_as_it_should_be/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know of a person who runs an investment firm and one of those options trading groups. He claims he is Series 63 licensed and worked at JP Morgan.

He then refused to cooperate with internal affairs about his actions, leading to further penalization. This person has lost a lot of people a lot of money in his options trading group. 

Knowing that he is managing his own investment firm, telling people he is a licensed RIA, and is committing fraud, I'd like to see the best way to report this to the proper authorities so the guys in jackets can drag him away in cuffs.

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The ‚ÄúNot Owned‚Äù column means: if you don‚Äôt own this  stock then you should ‚Ä¶ The ‚ÄúOwned‚Äù column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column ‚ÄúGrowth(90d)‚Äù refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column ‚ÄúTx(90d)‚Äù shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. ‚ÄúFactor‚Äù is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally ‚ÄúSuccess Rate‚Äù shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of ‚Äúlookalike‚Äù stocks as well as major ETF‚Äôs. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,323139,public,,self,Ladybaybee's recommended stock picks for 2-14-2019,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aqm2br/ladybaybees_recommended_stock_picks_for_2142019/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'WvYOu6jMxIRbPaqmICg6CzHpdrTkctjTI-UhRZmr7uA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 86, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_LpCfG6cOrE2abodhqeq88EyMd2DZ58QQg2ByQKM9PA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b7100f3316cbc5ff4b4bd4c59597fcb8ddd9998', 'width': 108}, {'height': 173, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_LpCfG6cOrE2abodhqeq88EyMd2DZ58QQg2ByQKM9PA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e62eece9df0a3cb1ee4df718ce2096e5c470e1', 'width': 216}, {'height': 256, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_LpCfG6cOrE2abodhqeq88EyMd2DZ58QQg2ByQKM9PA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c12aaaa1c84994488aba27556152cbcc50eb55e', 'width': 320}, {'height': 513, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_LpCfG6cOrE2abodhqeq88EyMd2DZ58QQg2ByQKM9PA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e358f5ec635258cf6d6b96214663419a3fd33448', 'width': 640}, {'height': 769, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_LpCfG6cOrE2abodhqeq88EyMd2DZ58QQg2ByQKM9PA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad87ef18fad2390d2fa79a989bc9c4c59bb71cd5', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 802, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_LpCfG6cOrE2abodhqeq88EyMd2DZ58QQg2ByQKM9PA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=49d28ebf95749bda851bb7b9c72777744e3e940e', 'width': 1000}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

Taking a look at their financial statements though something stood out to me, and I want to make sure I'm not just being a stickler. Their working capital is ~$750M, which for a company of their size is great, but their working capital ratio is 6.3, which is ridiculously high, almost to the point that they're not spending enough to grow their revenues as much as they could. This compounded by the fact that their working capital turnover ratio is &lt;1, indicating that they're not very efficient with turning their capital into revenue, which I find a bit odd given that their growing as such a torrid pace. As an investor, it's strange to me that a company that just basically doubled it's net loss from last year isn't spending as much as it could to maximize their already insane revenue growth.

I'm hoping somebody can be talk me down.

As an experiment, I started today by checking out some of the biggest drops on the market, checked the business in the news to make sure this wasn't a sign of an apocalyptic trend toward bankruptcy, and, as long as it seemed safe, invested when they when they were at a day-time low.

In every case, before the day was over, there was a peak that was worth at least a 2% return on my investment. I set up an app to notify me as soon as they reached 2%, as well, so I just had to wait for the ding, hit sell, and I had a small profit.

I didn't use a lot of money today, so it didn't translate into a lot of profit, but it occurs to me that short-term investment could lead to big rewards. You'd only have to get a 2% return on your investment 36 times to double your initial payment. If you started with $10,000 and pulled that off 13 times in a month, you'd have a monthly salary of $5,000 from stock trading alone, and it'd only get higher from there. 

There's obviously some risk in this approach, and I've almost exclusively heard people say this is a bad idea. So before I go off the deep end, I thought I'd ask people to talk me out of this.

Convince me: why is this a horrible idea?

Anyways idk how much the business has changed since 2015 but I imagine it's only gotten better as reflected by its stock performance. My question here is whether it's safe to enter with a larger position at its current price of $37 with a market cap of $4.4B, how do you value companies like this that are unique in their space? They're not exactly profitable yet but they have an extremely solid balance sheet with strong cash flow from operations and solid margins but I can't help but feel like a already missed the big window. Does anyone know any similar companies I can use to compare valuations with CHGG? 

I'm definitely not selling my 25 shares but I'm seriously considering buying another 30 to 40 shares.

Would love to hear other thoughts on the stock!

Positives

SWKS hold no long term debt on their balance sheet

1 billion dollars in cash after the most recent quarter and total assets of over 4.8 billion

2 Billion dollar share repurchase program that is expected to be executed over the next 2-3 years. Could retire north of 10.8% of shares assuming a average buyback price of 95$ (17%) including an estimated 2.5 million granted shares for management over that period.

Strong free cash that is poised to grow if the company can execute in key market segments.

Management expects 5G smart phone revenue to increase as much as 40% per phone.

As more developing countries move into 3G and 4G phones skyworks will have an opportunity to work with providers in those markets to gain share in new markets. (Speculation on my part of an often overlooked tailwind.)

A major supplier for many mobile carriers including companies such as Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Vivo, and several other major Chinese players..

The company has been able to execute on accretive acquisitions without taking on much if any debt at all in recent years.

The company expects increased diversity to increase significantly over the coming years as they believe they are poised to be a larger player in the INTERNET Of Things space.

The company has held up well even as Phone sales have struggled over the past few quarters and still expect to return to growth in the second half of this year before feeling real effects of 5G.

Has been paying a growing dividend that could become a very nice size over a 5-10 year period with reduced float and continued growth.

Trading at a trailing P/E of 13.07

Negatives

The company is fairly concentrated in their customer base with Apple representing between roughly 35-40% revenue for the company and once you include other smart phone players up to about 55-65% of total revenue from smartphone makers.

Could possibly be an acquisition target although the risk seems to be fairly small unless a company is willing to pay quite a large premium.

Smart phone market could continue to see units decline contrary to what management believes.

Could lose content in a number of areas if they fall behind on execution.

My position in the company is Long and at a cost basis of 68.08$. Would love to add to the position and would do so off a drop into the mid 70's or below and would consider adding in the low 80's if the price continues to hold there over the next year or so. Would love to hear others thoughts on the company bullish or bearish.

In february 2019 the stock drops to $11/share. I sell 100 shares. Do my long term shares sell making it an overall gain and I get taxed or do my short term ones sell and it goes as a loss and I don't pay any tax?

Technically the charts look good to me for the short and long-term. For a short term trade its below the 50day in what I consider the accumulation zone. Long term they've both trended upward and look ready for a golden cross. Slight bull div on $poahy as well. 


Fundamentally I think they are a great buy. VW will probably be much better about covering it's tracks and not getting caught doing illegal things like lying about their emissions data. They got fined billions. They're most likely going to be smarter. (Assumption) 

VW owns several huge manufactures like Porsche Audi, Bugatti, Ducati. 

VW and Audi are pushing electric car advertisements everyday. They have several more billions than Tesla and can RnD a much better platform and are already established across the globe. The VW car will be absolutely cheaper, and can reach a far greater audience! The Audi models are looking stunning. Compare to a Tesla model 3 which is supposed to be $35k but comes out costing more like $50k, I don't have the specifics but my uncle ordered one and the barebone model is $35k but he said it actually came out to closer to $50k.

Though I'm not saying I don't like Tesla's fundamentals. I just haven't found a good entry point on the technicals, my own mistakes. 

Porsche has one of the best performing hypercars that, correct me if I'm wrong, still holds the fastest production car nurburing time. Which is a hybrid. Porsche will also begin producing electrics that are stunning. Many of their current models already have hybrid options

So,  I know the weed industry is on the rise and lots of people are  investing in companies such as Aurora, Cronos, Canopy Growth, etc. I  just looked at CGC annual income statement and a couple of things stick  out:

1. CGC gross income has decreased every year so far, and it doesn't look like their gross income has ever been positive.
2. On a similar note, their net income has only increased one year in the past, but has been negative every year as well.
3. Because  of the previous points, their EPS is negative. Because the EPS is  negative, the estimated PE ratio is just 0.05. Now, I know Benjamin  Graham points out that a low PE ratio is not necessarily bad because it  means there is room for profit, but he also says that it may indicate a  genuine lack of potential.

To  me, being new to this, these seem like 3 glaring negative points to  consider. But, everywhere I look, I feel like investors are saying that  CGC is the stock to buy. Am I missing something? Please point out  anything I am confusing, misinterpreting, definitions I'm mislabeling,  etc.

Hi team,
One of the guidelines on /r/stocks is not to hesitate to tell us about a ticker we should know about!  So here it is.

Following up on the previous post submitted 6 months ago - 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/95mnqm/mission_ready_solutions_mrs_a_monster_in_the/

After a 6 month halt and reverse takeover, MRS has completed the acquisition of Unifire Inc, one of the 6 companies who are able to bid on the for the Defense Logistics Agency (‚ÄúDLA‚Äù) Special Operational Equipment (‚ÄúSOE‚Äù) Tailored Logistics Services (‚ÄúTLS‚Äù) contract renewals which total up to $33 billion in 10 years. MRS has submitted it's tender to the Department of Homeland Defense and apparently, they'll know in March 2019 how much of this pot they would receive. Historically, the majority of the contracts have gone to Atlantic Diving Supply but in the recent years, ADS has fallen out of favour with the DOD due to their fraud allegations.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I was curious as to what approach I should take to working up my losses, I do have one option spread left, which is an amazon credit of $220 and had a 1,670 break even, which expires in a few months. Aside from that, I don't think I want to trade options anymore due to the unforeseen liquidity risks.  So, what do I do going forward? What mentality should I have?

Then, I use technical analysis to figure out entry points, like when a stock hits what I think is support or break through resistance.

However, it has increasingly become apparent to me that using technical analysis to try to catch bottoms is a losing strategy.  Too often, I buy a stock at what appears to be support, it bounces slightly for a day or two and then plunges yet again.  Also, stocks sometimes break resistance and seem to continue up slightly before plunging.  Hard to tell why sometimes.  

There are also scenarios where I see a stock at what I think is a cheap price but wait too long to enter (usually waiting for a retracement) and then it breaks out like a rocket without returning to the support level I was waiting for.  Sometimes, I then buy the stock in a FOMO move, and then it drops.  (smh)

Anyone have any tips on when to deploy money into the market?  I heard somewhere that you could deploy in regular intervals, like invest $5000 every few months or something like that so as to offset the possibility of buying too high or too low for any particular instance.  Does that work?  Others say that when the market appears to be in a correction, then you should deploy, but I've tried that and have caught my share of falling knives.

Any advice?

(Finally, there's the ever-present specter of a bear market, esp. in this late cycle.  However, having money sit in cash doesn't generate me much in terms of interest.

I'm an ATVI shareholder, although not a large amount and not for a very long amount of time. With that being said, I bought in because of the Intellectual Property that ATVI has, specifically with Blizzard. I like how they were weaving it throughout other games - play this event in Overwatch and get this Heros of the Storm Skin, play this WoW and get this Hearthstone back. Regardless of what you think of microtransactions, I think this was a smart strategic step to get fridge gamers to try all that battle.net has to offer.

However, whenever I talk about ATVI or read a post I always see a mention that the devs are leaving or that senior people are jumping ship. Well that sucks. I still trust ATVI and I will continue to hold my shares, but where are the Devs going? 

Is there another gaming company that should be on my radar because old school Blizzard devs are there now and working on brand new potentially amazing IP?

1. DryShips Dec 2016 - I bought 475 shares for about $3500 thinking it'd be something that would take a long time, but that they'd eventually pull back up. I see that I was charged $20 ""Reorg Fees"" periodically in early 2017 - and by July - My shares were just gone. I've tried googling and reaching out to E\*Trade (at the time) and they explained that the company did multiple reverse splits, until my 475 shares wasn't even 1 share. Now I've got nothing. Can someone explain (maybe like i'm 5...) how that happens and how to make sure that doesn't happen again?
2. Penny Stocks -- Obviously I will avoid these in the future... but I have 10K shares in GBGLF -- which have been worth $0 for quite sometime. Is there anything that can be done with these, or are they just stuck in my portfolio forever? Something happened with them... the symbol doesn't actually exist anymore. This was only about $100 worth of stock at the time... but If there's anything that can/should be done with these, I can't figure out what it is...

I buy 100 shares of a company for $100 in 2018. The stock price drops to $80, I panic and sell for a 20% loss. Stock falls further but recovers and I end up buying 100 shares for $80 within 30 days essentially making it a wash sale. I will not be able to show this $2000 (100*20) in my taxes of this year.

Now I am holding long for over an year, and after much up and down I again sell my shares in 2019 for $80 making this a no profit and no loss sale only this time I dont buy that stock again. When I file taxes for 2019, will this be a no profit no loss transaction? Of yes, how will I ever get to write of my $2000 loss that I made in 2018?

The surprise now being the resounding launch of Apex Legends which I believe they wholly own. The market rewarded EA by going up +17% but what next?

I personally believe that Apex will continue gaining players to justify a buy at this level. Google search trends shows that its comparable to fortnite, twitch numbers are currently above fortnite and the subreddit numbers are comparable (of course fortnite users are younger and reddit trends older). 

Some napkin math.

EA makes roughly 1 billion profit a year. Fortnite apparently made 3 billion off 200 million registered users.
Apex has 10 million registered users so far so if we say they make it to 50m that would add $750m, roughly 70% to profits. Add a bit of PE, market exuberance and the potential gains should be there.

I have a few questions for you guys

What are some ways to guestimate the player base? Correlating social data with the company announced numbers?

What will the userbase number for Apex stall at, more importantly why?

Am I wrong? Whats the bear case?

I currently have a portfolio composed 100% by SPOT stock (I work there).
I would like to re-allocate some of those stocks into something else to decrease risk a little bit. 

I'm looking for short-medium term options (2-3 years) and then re-iterate this process in the future. 


So I would like to get some advice (and ideas) about:

- is this a safe strategy?
- which stocks should I look at?
- when is a good time for switching from stock A to stock B? Ideally one should wait when A is doing great and when B is doing not so great, but I feel it's not easy.

My investment selection is only based on some contributors to seeking alpha, blogger, youtube, and Warren Buffett.

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 11th, 2019.

# **Trade could be the biggest market catalyst in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/what-to-watch-next-week.html)**
*****
&gt; The earnings deluge continues and inflation reports are due, but it will be the tone of trade talks in Beijing that could have the biggest impact on markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin head to China, as the U.S. and Chinese still appear to be far apart on trade differences, ahead of a March 1 deadline on new tariffs.
*****
&gt; Stocks were spooked Thursday and were weak Friday after White House top economic adivsor Larry Kudlow said differences between the two countries are ""pretty sizeable"" and the White House confirmed there are no plans yet for President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to meet.
*****
&gt; ""I think it's a very big deal, but I think this whole process is one to manage expectations, and the market, I think, is being set up for positive news. I think if some good news comes out next week, it will be a very positive event for the market. If not we could see some sideways volatility,"" said Don Townswick, head of equities at global investment management firm Conning.
*****
&gt; Earnings will continue to rumble in from names including Cisco Systems, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, as another 60 S&amp;P 500 companies report. Earnings for the fourth quarter have been up about 16 percent, but S&amp;P 500 companies have warned that expectations were too high and now first quarter earnings are likely to show an actual decline.
*****
&gt; ""Obviously, last year's earnings were supercharged. This year, what looks like a negative year in terms of earnings growth is relative to last year,"" Townswick said. Many strategists point to the massive corporate tax cuts as being a big contributor to the pop in 2018 earnings growth, which reached 23 percent.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there is some important data, particularly December's retail sales Friday and CPI consumer inflation Wednesday. Producer inflation is expected on Thursday. The inflation data will be especially important after the Fed indicated, following its January meeting, that it was willing to pause in its rate hiking and that inflation remain subdued.

# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 11 of Last 13

&gt; February‚Äôs option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 25 years with an average loss of 0.25% for S&amp;P 500. Despite a bumpy finish, expiration week as a whole has fared better, but nets an average gain of just 0.39% on the S&amp;P 500 since 1994 with 16 of 25 winning weeks. More recently, S&amp;P 500 has advanced in eleven of the last thirteen options expiration weeks. The week after, has been down 13 of the last 25 years. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar patterns over the same timeframe.

# Full Year Gains in 10 of the Last 11 Pre-Election Years with Positive January Indicator Trifecta

&gt; From recent posts and the 2019 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac we know that pre-election years have historically been the best year of the four-year-presidential cycle and a positive January Trifecta has also been historically bullish for the market. The impact of a positive January Trifecta in pre-election is not as powerful as other years of the cycle because pre-election years are typically quite positive however, the Trifecta does raise the ceiling. In the following chart of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, the one-year seasonal patterns for ‚ÄúAll Years,‚Äù ‚ÄúPre-Election Years,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrifecta Pre-Election Years‚Äù and 2019 have been plotted. Declines in October are the result of the crash in 1987.

# High Yield Stalls

&gt; Just like the broader market this week, the rally in high yield credit stalled out a bit. Earlier on Friday, we highlighted the fact that the S&amp;P 500 ran into resistance right at its 200-DMA earlier this week and has been pulling back ever since. In the case of the ETF that tracks the high yield credit market (HYG), we have seen a similar setup. Coming off the lows in December, high yield was a little bit late to the rally, but it quickly made up any lost ground and has since followed the move in the S&amp;P 500 step for step. In fact, this week HYG even managed to briefly trade above its 200-DMA. In this case, though, HYG ran out of momentum pretty much right at the same spot (~$85) where recent bounce attempts also ran out of steam.

&gt; The fact that these rallies in both high yield and the broader equity market are stalling out right at key moving averages is no doubt a focus of technicians, but given the magnitude of the moves off the lows, they had to take a break at some point, so why not at a point where everyone was expecting it. The only test now is whether there are enough bids below current levels to support the market, or will sellers eventually overwhelm the balance.

# The Bespoke Report ‚Äî The Resistance!

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 finished the week with a slight gain after posting positive returns early in the week and declines late in the week. Friday saw declines early in the day, but investors really stepped up their buying in the afternoon to fully erase what had been a pretty sizable decline. Friday‚Äôs late-day strength was a microcosm of the intraday buying trend we‚Äôve seen all year.

&gt; As shown in the chart below, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied in the last hour of trading on 80% of trading days over the last five weeks going back to the start of 2019. Readings of 80% or higher have been rare over the last 10 years dating back to the start of the bull market in 2009.

So, in the event we get a bear market, is AAL likely to crash significantly more than it already has or will the drop be more tempered because it has dropped so much already?

You can invoke the skill ""FinTech Buddy"" from your Google Assistant App in Android and iOS apps as well. 

This is an effort to just put out data that one can use to view the trend and suggests data as is. No interpretations/ predictions. 

Folks in the subreddit are smart enough and just need the data points in the format that they can use and hear.

I understand that EPS is the NET income divided by the share price. What I don't understand is why that's really important. The only answer I received was that it'll give you an idea of the company's growth when the EPS goes up. Then again, the company can deceive us with their EPS, so how would we truly know if it's a lie or not? Plus, would it show the history of the company's EPS? 

I heard someone saying that ""you have a claim to the EPS but that doesn't mean that you can withdraw your claim"". So, if a company is 10 times worth its value, but you can't claim it, why does it matter to look at the EPS in the first place? 

I guess this is where the Ratio comes in. I understand that you get the underpriced, fairly priced, and overpriced shares. Does that mean you should:
a) Buy some underpriced shares because you have confidence that the share price will grow?
b) Have fairly priced shares in your portfolio because it's less risky?
c) Ignore overpriced shares because the price could dropped and you'd lose money?

\-More than 200 physician KOLs are invested in Evolus's parent company

\-First 900 kDa neurotoxin to be filed with the FDA since Botox

\-DPW-450 is projected to be 20-25% cheaper then Botox

\-Approved by the FDA recently

\-Massive  [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/volume/)  spike

\-Directors bought shares in the mid 30's last year.  One of the directors even reported for her son who bought 1000 shares.

I  feel tomorrow is the perfect entry.  Yesterday was textbook profit   taking.  Buying the dip tomorrow (hopefully it dips further).  This is a   long term hold.  No dilution is scheduled yet, and they have 100   million in cash as of September 30th.  They also only spent 13 million   in cash during the 9 months ended Sept.30th.  No offering should be   expected in the near future

Will  possibly sell after 20% gain depending on overall market condition  and  changes in future projections.  Their biggest problem is   commercialization.  Looking for fast gains like what we saw during May   of last year, but we shall see.

I will conclude by referencing to an old video made a few years after the financial crisis.   It is titled ""buy the dip"".

### US Stocks

* Market sentiment is dropping dramatically in the pre-market following an announcement that US President Donald Trump¬†and Chinese President Xi Jinping will not meet before a March 1 trade war deadline.¬† This came after Director of¬†National Economic Council (NEC) Larry Kudlow commented that ‚Äúthere is pretty sizeable distance to go‚Äù in the trade negotiations between the world‚Äôs two largest economies.

This is an update to my post from last month about the technical bounce coming in SP500. That thread can be found linked below

&amp;nbsp;

[Why The Odds Of A Rebound In The SP500 Are Increasing](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a97z6f/why_the_odds_of_a_rebound_in_the_sp500_are/)

&amp;nbsp;

[Current SPX Weekly Chart](https://i.imgur.com/LxhJXnt.png)

&amp;nbsp;

After the technical bounce, we have reached my projected target of the 50 week moving average much faster than I expected. I was thinking we wouldn't hit it until March or April but we reached it in early February. 

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of people say you can't time the market but you can measure risk/reward and trend. And at these levels, the risk/reward is no longer in your favor to the upside for equities in the short term. If you have a lot of individual high beta stocks in your portfolio, time to start cutting your exposure to them. 

&amp;nbsp;

In my opinion, best case scenario is that we trade sideways for the rest of the year. If the SPX does fall back below 2606, move more positions into cash.

&amp;nbsp;

I am a 23 year old investor who just got in the game. I am a long term low risk investor. I‚Äôve got $250/month going into my Charles Schwab account and $250 going into my acorns account. 

 My portfolio is tech heavy and the breakdown is as follows: 7 AAPL stocks, 4 NVDA stocks, 3 AMD stocks and 1 ADBE stock, all worth $2800. Needless to say, the crash hit me hard, and I‚Äôm slowly recovering.

Need advice on whether I should keep doing what I‚Äôm doing and bank on tech stocks, or whether I should diversify (some recommendations of stocks would be greatly appreciated). I also need advice on whether or not I should ditch the acorns saving account and go all in with the stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into deep analysis, is it a reasonable able to make a judgement of value based on the market capitalization in relation to their net income?

&amp;#x200B;

For example:

&amp;#x200B;

$1115 - Google - Market cap approx 800 BLN, net income 30bln - 695 ml shares outstanding, 10bln ad revenue

$1640 -AMZN - Market Cap approx 800 BLN, net income 10bln - 490mln shares outstanding, 2.2bln

$170 - FB - Market Cap 488bln, net income 22bln -  2.854bln shares outstanding, 13bln ad revenue

&amp;#x200B;

If only using a ratio of market cap  to ad revenue, where you assume a portion of the market cap is strictly from Ad revenue:

&amp;#x200B;

Google: mkt cap approx 266 bln w/ 10 bln ad revenue, 26bln per 1 bln revenue

AMZN: mkt cap 176bln w/ 2.2bln ad revenue,  approx 80bln per bln revenue

FB:  mkt cap 288 bln w/ 13bln ad revenue 22 bln per 1 bln revenue

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of ad revenue only, amzn looks way over valued. google is the middle, and FB is about 18% undervalued from Google. If you were to make a conservative estimate, then maybe Facebook is undervalued by about 9%-10% and would put it's price at around $187.  

Is this a fair conclusion for valuation?

&amp;#x200B;

Side question:

In the last 10 years, the market has been pretty good all around. If the market were to tank and a huge recession were to hit, would a fair assumption be that companies increased their ad expenditure in order to gain more exposure? Or is it common practice to reduce your advertising budget when revenue is not quite as good?  This would mean a reduction in ad revenue for these 3 companies.

Palladium is heavily used in the automotive industry; I am fearful with all the recent news of declining auto sales numbers that Palladium‚Äôs price can‚Äôt sustain this run up posing a big risk to these guys.

* PEG Ratio between 1-2
* Debt ratio under .40 (sometimes .50)
* Current Ratio of at least 1
* Sales Growth past 5y of at least 10%
* Positive ROE and ROA 

I play around with the debt sometimes, because there are some really good stocks i've come across that have a little more debt.

My first pick was actually MSFT but thats only cause i had to do a whole project in my last semester of finance comparing it to APPL and estimating its value.

After watching PCTY and learning about its business, i decided to go ahead and buy. I probably bought a little high but w/e. I got in at $72 shortly before the correction. I probably should've waited knowing that much of the market was overvalued at the time, but i was eager lol.

Right now its close to 50 again and has been trading flat for the 3 last days. Earnings are late next week.

I'm conducting some analyses of cumulative abnormal returns around patent disclosure dates, and noticed that for the filing date of a patent (private information, not actually disclosed to the public) abnormal returns tend to be high. However, this is not paired with high cumulative abnormal turnover (i.e. volume is pretty normal around this date).  


Could someone please give me a valid explanation as to why abnormal returns around a given event may be extremely high, but no observable changes to trading activity exist?

I'm going to paper trade for a while, most likely until summer starts/school ends.

But I got a question. So my school starts 8:00 CTS and stock market opens at 8:30 CTS, so there is no way for me to trade in morning. I guess I could do premarket but the volume and liquidity is very low so it is risky. I get out of school at around 2:30 and then I do sports until around 4:30. Obviously the stock market closes at 3pm CST so that's a problems.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

### RBC Capital Markets, Mark Mahaney

Revenue growth was ‚Äúvery consistent &amp; robust‚Äù with an ‚Äúunprecedented 36 straight qtrs of 23% Y/Y growth."" However, the GAAP operating margin ‚Äúwas the lowest we‚Äôve seen in many years.‚Äù

Price target lowered to $1,300 from $1,400, reiterates outperform rating

### Nomura Instinet, Mark Kelley

‚ÄúThe revenue outperformance was importantly driven by better Google revenue, with Other Bets below our estimates (to be expected with no disclosure).‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the full year, Capex almost doubled, but the 2019 outlook calls for Capex growth to slow ‚Äòmeaningfully.‚Äô ‚Äù

Keeps buy rating, but trims price target to $1,310 from $1,350

### Morgan Stanley, Brian Nowak

Affirms overweight rating and its Street-high price target of $1,500

The fourth quarter ‚Äúhighlights the strength of GOOGL‚Äôs core and portfolio of assets, difficulties in modeling qtrly ins and outs, and need for better transparency.‚Äù

Alphabet‚Äôs ‚Äúcore/Other Bets are strong and appreciating in value. But it may take revisions or disclosure for the market to appreciate that.‚Äù

[Read more: Disclosure Is Google‚Äôs Wild Card as Costs Rise: Earnings Outlook](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PMFDAB6KLVR6)

### Baird, Colin Sebastian

‚ÄúElevated R&amp;D and capex spend overshadow solid revenue beat.‚Äù

‚ÄúInvestors will likely focus on accelerating R&amp;D spend and $7 billion of quarterly capex as a potential indication of ongoing investments (and margin pressure) in CY19, as also suggested by Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat‚Äôs comments.‚Äù

Other revenue of $6.48 billion slightly above the average estimate reflects ‚Äúcontinuing momentum for Google Cloud platform, inclusion of Nest, along with Google Play and Pixel hardware.‚Äù

Baird has an outperform rating and $1,380 price target.

### Raymond James, Aaron Kessler

‚ÄúSome of the R&amp;D costs were more one-time nature and Google also noted that headcount growth will moderate in 2019 and capex growth will moderate quite significantly.‚Äù

‚ÄúSlowing opex growth in 2019 could serve as a catalyst for shares.‚Äù

Kessler maintains outperform¬†rating and $1,300 price target ‚Äúgiven solid continued advertising growth (search/YouTube), increasing Google Cloud/hardware traction, and an attractive valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to put this out there for anyone that needs it. As the title suggests I found that one of the most helpful habits I got myself into was creating a daily journal. I journal every big event in the news, every earnings prediction, every stock play, and so on. I also make it a point to catalogue other sources with opinions on these subjects. 

&amp;#x200B;

When some news hits, I catalogue the event then turn to all the various news sources, including Reddit. I look for what was said and who it was that said it. Then I will write down my own opinion. What do I think will happen based on this event, who do I think will be impacted, etc. You get the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, at the end of the week, month, quarter or year I will revisit these topics write down how things actually played out.

&amp;#x200B;

I think ultimately it has helped me get a better understanding of my own thought process and the flaws therein. I've found that I have biases in certain places and they're very clear to see in the repeated patterns of my thoughts. I've also been able to somewhat sort out the mass of bullshit news to see whose opinions I can rely on. 

&amp;#x200B;

The markets are enormous and all encompassing so to want to understand them fully is well beyond me. However, I have can say that I've gotten a better grasp on everything through these journals.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,319646,public,,self,"Keep a Daily Journal of Your Plays, Thoughts and Ideas!

TTWO got beat down pretty hard after Red Dead Redemption 2 sales surpassed estimates, but not by enough. they were one of the most popular games trending on various internet sites and social media this past month, and I expect the sales will beat estimates. 

Grand Theft Auto V is their most successful game franchise of all time, and is still a cash cow. It was the 14th most streamed game on twitch, neck and neck with Activision Blizzard‚Äôs Call of Duty 4. 

NBA 2k19 is very popular here in the US, along with many other countries, but most importantly; China. It is extremely popular overseas and is trending on Chinese internet sites. I expect this will help boost earnings greatly. 

Also, although many American companies have been affected by tariffs, which has brought down the general market, TTWO shouldn‚Äôt be greatly effected as there are no tariffs on Video games or digital content. 

And there is talk in China about slowing the use of video games and the government painting a bad picture for games. I think they would likely target violent games first, before they mess around with a basketball game. 

Tl;dr: Overall, TTWO will benefit from surprising sales numbers, especially with NBA 2k19 overseas.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why people don't fucking just Google things or read one of approximately 10 thousand articles explaining what options are.

Questions like this make me so mad, and a bit sad. People looking for quick success just because they briefly overheard someone talking about something. Go read about it, understand what it is, and then make up your mind about whether it's the right move to fucking place an order for it.

To me, this sounds like someone asking ""Hey bruh, I heard nuclear power is cool and can generate hella energy and stuff. So I bought some Uranium, what do I do now??""

On the other hand, I wish ""low effort humans"" like this get what they deserve and have their option contracts wiped flat out to zero within the week. For them, it seems the only way to learn what fire is, is to set themselves ablaze.

This stupid stuff just bothers me so much. And not just when it's about options. It's like a shitty approach to life and unwillingness to actually learn something. Like, you cheated your way through college and then fell flat on your face when trying to live in the real world. And now you're probably blaming the education system. Go make an effort to learn something before attempting to apply it, morons.

Of course it kept plummeting ever since, falling all the way down to 26. 

Well I kept averaging down and down until finally my average cost was 38. Luckily that was before it roared back with a vengeance in early January.

* Low Volatility may be a crowded factor with Forward 12-month P/E for the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility Index is nearing an all-time high. ¬†Institutional investors continue to worry that the rich valuations for the factor group may cause it to structurally underperform the next time we see a sell-off in S&amp;P 500 stocks.
* 4Q Earnings season for the S&amp;P 500, to date, has been better than feared with 60% of reports beating top-line estimates and 75% beating earnings expectations. ¬†However, market strategists point out that magnitude of earnings beats is the lowest it has been in 7 years.

The course starts off by introducing you to the four main areas of investment banking ‚Äì Capital Markets, Advisory, Trading and Brokerage, and Asset Management.

Then we continue by digging deeper into each line of business. ¬†

You will learn the subtleties of Initial Public Offerings, Seasoned Equity Offerings, Private Placements, Bond Issuances, Loan Syndications, Securitizations, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Restructurings, Trading Instruments, Asset Management Vehicles and more. ¬†

**Pretty much everything that can come up in an investment banking interview.**

However, the best part is that you will learn different valuation techniques like the ones used by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. We will show you how to carry out a Discounted Cash Flow valuation, a multiples valuation, and a Leveraged buyout valuation. You will estimate a company‚Äôs cost of capital and future cash flows. Don‚Äôt worry if these sound unfamiliar right now; everything is shown in the course - step-by-step - with no steps skipped. ¬†",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,319246,public,,self,"Free Complete Investment Banking, Financial Modeling, and Stock Valuation Course",,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/amxqlt/free_complete_investment_banking_financial/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hear a lot of businesses say now that Facebook ads are not as powerful as they used to be and many are switching over to Google ads instead.

Any such deal would come amid a battle for control of Papa John‚Äôs with the chain‚Äôs founder John Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of the company. Schnatter resigned as chairman last July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call. He retains a seat on the company‚Äôs board. 

The transaction, which could be structured as a private investment in public equity, would boost Papa John‚Äôs finances, the sources said, as the company seeks to recover from low franchisee profitability and boost its sales through promotional discounts. 

Shares of Louisville, Kentucky-based Papa John‚Äôs dropped 6.2 percent at $39.63, giving the company a market capitalization of about $1.2 billion. 

There is no certainty that Papa John‚Äôs will agree to any deal, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Papa John‚Äôs declined to comment. 

Reuters reported in October that several buyout firms had shown interest in acquiring Papa John‚Äôs, including Bain Capital, CVC Capital Partners, KKR &amp; Co Inc and Roark Capital. None of them proposed a deal that the company would accept. 

Papa John‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie has vowed to move beyond the fight with Schnatter with a new advertising and marketing campaign, while also removing Schnatter‚Äôs image from company promotions. 

Tesla to sell cheaper Model 3 in China

Schnatter has been seeking internal documents to try to show the company was mismanaged and to determine if he was improperly pushed out. 

Last month, Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware Court of Chancery ordered the company‚Äôs directors to give Schnatter documents and communications, including text messages on personal devices, related to his firing. The order covered some messages between directors and their lawyers. 

Both sides said they were pleased with the ruling. The company noted the judge narrowed the scope of the document requests, while Schnatter called it a vindication of his right to the information. 

It remains unclear whether Schnatter will put forward a slate of board nominees to take control of Papa John‚Äôs. The company typically holds its annual shareholders meeting in May, during which directors are elected.

Climate change and the need to move away from fossil fuels makes the industry an interesting opportunity for investors. Both Volvo and BMW have already announced that in the next few years, all their models will at least be partly electrically driven. On top of that multiple countries have stated years from which the sale of petrol- or diesel driven cars will be prohibited.

&amp;#x200B;

In light of these changes the Bavarian BMW is an interesting stock to keep an eye on. The company is doing well in Europe, the United States and Chine. Also the company is working hard to get their electrically driven vehicles on the same performance level as their petrol driven models. Their relatively big investments in improving their electrically driven models is currently a burden on their profit margins, but in the long term this should pay off.

&amp;#x200B;

The i-series electrical vehicles of the company especially stand out because of their lightweight bodywork made out of carbon fibre. On top of that BMW has patented a smart way to connect the Samsung batteries they use for their electrical vehicles. Thanks to this technique of connecting the batteries they are capable of producing a battery big and stable enough to efficiently power a car. Even before the big Volkswagen scandal with their tamper software, BMW was one of the few European carmakers that really embraced sustainability. Carbon fibre is energy intensive in its production, but the German carmaker only uses sustainable sources for its production. They, for example, have four large windturbines in Leipzig that deliver enough energy for the whole production process. De factory in Washington is fully fed from electricity generated from waterpower. They have also developed a plan to be able to dismantle every car from the i-series to re-use 95% of its materials.

&amp;#x200B;

The share is currently at a p/e ratio of 5.756 compared to an average of 8.262 for the past 5 years. Compared them to their competitors they also do pretty well on this ratio: Fiat Chrysler - 7.178, Ford  - 10.0, Audi - 8.265, Daimler - 6.014, Volvo - 9.114. Also the dividend yield of around 5% is very good compared to the rest of the industry.

# **Jobs report removes some fear, but market still in 'tug of war' over how much growth is slowing  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/jobs-report-removes-some-fear-but-market-still-in-tug-of-war-over-how-much-growth-is-slowing.html)**
*****
&gt; After January's strong jobs report calmed some recession fears, investors will be picking through the next wave of earnings reports and economic data for clues on just how much the U.S. economy could be slowing.
*****
&gt; Dozens of earnings, from companies like Alphabet, Disney and Eli Lily, report in the week ahead, and there are just a few economic reports like trade data and ISM services on Tuesday. Investors will also be watching the outcome of Treasury auctions for $84 billion in Treasury notes and bonds Tuesday through Thursday, after the Fed's dovish tone helped put a lid on interest rates in the past week.
*****
&gt; Nearly half the S&amp;P 500 companies had reported for the fourth quarter by Friday morning, and 71 percent beat earnings estimates, while 62 percent have beaten revenue estimates. But earnings growth forecasts for the first quarter continue to decline as more companies report, and they are currently barely breaking even at under 1 percent growth, versus the 15 percent growth in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; ""Granted the more we hear from companies, and particularly in terms of their guidance and projections on revenues, things can slowly change. The first thing companies do is they stop spending money. Cap spending slows down, and if revenue growth does not pick up, they let people go. This is still wait and see,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the 304,000 jobs added in January did ease some concerns about a slowing economy, as did a stronger than expected ISM manufacturing report Friday. But the view of the first quarter is still unclear, as many economic reports were missed during the government shutdown. Economists expect growth in the first quarter of just above 2 percent, after growth of about 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; Stocks closed out January with a sharp gain on Thursday, and started February on Friday on a flattish note. The S&amp;P 500 has rebounded about 15 percent from its Dec. 24 closing low. Last month's 7.9 percent gain was the best performance for January in more than 30 years.
The old Wall Street adage says 'so goes January, so goes the year.' If that holds, stocks could finish 2019 higher. But February is another story, and on average, it is a flat month for the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; ""The tug of war that you saw in the market, that was going on in the last half of last year is playing out in the data. Some of the data is a bit lower, but some of the economic surprises are picking up to the upside rather than downside,"" said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the ISM may have improved but it reflected very low exports and flat backlogs, even though there was a snap back in new orders.
*****
&gt; ""I would fade the jobs report,"" said Boockvar, noting the level of growth may have been inflated by government workers taking on part-time jobs during the government shutdown.
*****
&gt; Boocvkar said the jobs report also looked strong on the surface, but he's concerned the unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent from 3.9 percent.
*****
&gt; ""The question of whether we go into a recession or not is how does the stock market affect confidence?"" Boockvar said. Confidence readings in the past week were low, and consumer sentiment Friday was its lowest since before President Donald Trump took office.
*****
&gt; Krosby said stocks could test recent lows or put in a higher low. If there's a big selloff, ""That would not necessarily mean it was a clue a recession is coming. It's just a normal testing mechanism,"" she said.
*****
&gt; The Fed removed a big concern from the markets in the past week, when its post-meeting statement and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's briefing tilted dovish, assuring markets the Fed would pause in its interest rate hiking. Investors had feared the Fed would hurt the softening economy with its rate hikes. Now, the biggest fears are about the trade war between the U.S. and China and slowing Chinese growth.
*****
&gt; The jobs report, and the ISM manufacturing data were also important because the lack of data during the government's 35 day shutdown has left gaps in the economic picture.
*****
&gt; ""This is really a sign the Fed stole the thunder from the economic data. By saying they're patient plasters over any kind of economic data in the near term, and I suspect the near term lasts through the first quarter because of the government shutdown, the weather, weak GDP,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
&gt; Chandler said the markets will be hanging on any news on the trade talks with China. ""Even if it's not the all encompassing trade deal we were promised, it's a return to where we were before with China promising to buy energy and farm products. We'll continue to have some kind of talks with the China, like we had under Obama and Bush,"" said Chandler.

# Now What?

&gt; What a year it has been. After the worst December for stocks in 87 years that contributed to the worst fourth quarter since the 2008‚Äì09 financial crisis, stocks have bounced back in spectacular fashion. In fact, with a day to go, stocks are looking at their best first month of the year in 30 years.

&gt; What could happen next? ‚ÄúWe like to say that the easy 10% has been made off the lows and the next 10% will be much tougher,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThings like Fed policy, China uncertainty, and overall global growth concerns all will play a part in where equity markets go from here.‚Äù

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index about 10% away from new highs, we do think new highs are quite possible at some point this year. Positive news from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and China trade talks, as well as the realization by investors that the odds of a recession in 2019 are quite low could spark potential new highs. Remember, fiscal spending as a percentage of overall gross domestic product (GDP) is higher this year than it was last year. Many think the tax cut and fiscal policies in play last year were a one-time sugar high. We don‚Äôt see it that way and expect the benefits from fiscal policy to help extend this economic cycle at least another year‚Äîlikely more.

&gt; As we head into February, note that it hasn‚Äôt been one of the best months for stocks. In fact, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, February has been virtually flat, and over the past 20 years only June and September have shown worse returns. Overall, the market gains have been quite impressive since the December 24 lows, but we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all to see a near-term consolidation or pullback.

# A Fed Pause and the Flattening Yield Curve

&gt; Investors have increasingly positioned for a Federal Reserve (Fed) pause, which could portend a shift in fixed income markets. Fed fund futures are pricing in about a 70% probability that the Fed will keep rates unchanged for the rest of 2019, and the market‚Äôs dovish tilt has weighed on short-term rates.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 2-year yield has typically followed the fed funds rate since policymakers began raising rates in December 2015. While we expect one or two more hikes this cycle, there is a possibility that the Fed‚Äôs December hike was its last, which will likely cap short-term rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Short-Term-Rates-Poin-to-Fed-Pause.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Short-term yields have outpaced longer-term yields over the past few years, flattening the yield curve and raising concerns that U.S. economic progress may not be able to keep up with the Fed‚Äôs tightening. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yield has fallen negative before every single U.S. recession since 1970.

&gt; If the Fed pauses, the curve will likely reverse course and steepen as solid economic growth and quickening (but manageable) inflation drives longer-term yields higher. As mentioned in our Outlook 2019, FUNDAMENTAL: How to Focus on What Really Matters in the Markets, we‚Äôre forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will increase significantly from current levels and trade within a range of 3.25‚Äì3.75% in 2019.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe remain optimistic about U.S. economic growth prospects, and recent data show inflation remains at manageable levels,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúBecause of this, we expect the data-dependent Fed to be less aggressive than initially feared, as policymakers juggle these factors with the impacts of trade tensions and tepid global growth.‚Äù

&gt; To be clear, investors shouldn‚Äôt fear a flattening yield curve given the backdrop of solid economic growth and modest inflation. Historically, the yield curve has remained relatively flat or inverted for years before some recessions started. Since 1970, the United States has entered a recession an average of 21 months after the yield curve inverted.

# Jobless Claims‚Äô Historic Significance

&gt; Jobless claims have dropped to a 49-year low. Based on historical trends, this could signal that a U.S. economic recession is further off than many expect.

&gt; Data released January 24 showed jobless claims fell to 199K in the week ending January 18, the lowest number since 1969 and far below consensus estimates of 218K. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, current jobless claims have been significantly lower than those in the 12-month periods preceding each recession since the early 1970s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/initial-jobless-claims-defy-recession-fears.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Jobless claims have fallen out of the spotlight as the economic cycle has matured, but they could prove important again as investors‚Äô recessionary fears increase. While most labor-market data serve as lagging indicators of U.S. economic health, jobless claims are a leading indicator. Historically, a 75‚Äì100K increase in claims over a 26-week period has been associated with a recession.

&gt; ‚ÄúLast week‚Äôs jobless claims print was particularly impressive given the partial government shutdown and weakening corporate sentiment,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúThe U.S. labor market remains strong and will help buoy consumer health and output growth this year.‚Äù

&gt; Other predictive data sets have signaled U.S. recessionary odds are low. Data last week showed the Conference Board‚Äôs Leading Economic Index (LEI), based on 10 leading economic indicators (like jobless claims, manufacturers‚Äô new orders, and stock prices), grew 4.3% year over year in December. In contrast, the LEI has turned negative year over year before all economic recessions since 1970. Because of its solid predictive ability, the LEI is a component of our Recession Watch Dashboard.

# Best S&amp;P January Since 1987

&gt; Most major U.S. stock indexes rallied to new recovery and year-to-date highs today shrugging off some misses and weakness from Microsoft, DuPont and Visa. S&amp;P 500 finished the month strong with a 7.9% gain. This is the best S&amp;P January since 1987. This is also the third January Trifecta in a row. 

&gt; Last year the S&amp;P 500 crumbled in the fourth quarter under the weight of triple threats from a hawkish and confusing Fed, a newly divided Congress and the U.S. trade battle with China, finishing in the red. 2017‚Äôs Trifecta was followed by a full-year gain of 19.4%, including a February-December gain of 17.3%. As you can see in the table below, the long term track record of the Trifecta is rather impressive, posting full-year gains in 27 of the 30 prior years with an average gain for the S&amp;P 500 of 17.1%. 

&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.5% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .739 batting average. 

&gt; Our January Indicator Trifecta combines the Santa Claus Rally, the First Five Days Early Warning System and our full-month January Barometer. The predicative power of the three is considerably greater than any of them alone; we have been rather impressed by its forecasting prowess. This is the 31st time since 1949 that all three January Indicators have been positive and the twelfth time (previous eleven times highlighted in grey in table below) this has occurred in a pre-election year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e9cf3f0f44827a9f7189f0810f19571/tumblr_inline_pm9jeiqYwm1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; With the Fed turning more dovish and President Trump tacking to the center and meeting with China and market internals improving along with the gains, the market is tracking Base Case and Best Case scenarios outlined in our 2019 Annual Forecast. Next eleven month and full-year 2019 performance is expected to be more in line with typical Pre-Election returns.

# February Almanac: Small-Caps Tend to Outperform

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is not all that stellar. February ranks no better than seventh and has posted paltry average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from ‚ÄúJanuary Effect‚Äù carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.1% in February since 1979‚Äîjust the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In pre-election years, February‚Äôs performance generally improves with average returns all positive. NASDAQ performs best, gaining an average 2.8% in pre-election-year Februarys since 1971. Russell 2000 is second best, averaging gains of 2.5% since 1979. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000, the large-cap indices, tend to lag with average advances of around 1.0%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/665b5c71c11ad02d59f9f633375cae36/tumblr_inline_pluyffMGPi1spdppr_400.jpg))**

# 5% Months

&gt; 7%? Bulls will take it! After an abysmal December, the S&amp;P 500 is currently set to finish the month with its best January return since 1987. This month‚Äôs gain will mark the 16th time since the lows of the Financial Crisis in March 2009 that the S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 5% in a given month. The table below highlights each of the 15 prior months where the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 5% and shows how much the S&amp;P 500 gained on the month as well as its performance on the last trading day of the month and the first trading day of the subsequent month.

&gt; When looking at the table, a few things stand out. First, the first trading day of a month that follows a month where the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 5% has been extremely positive as the S&amp;P 500 averages a gain of 0.84% (median: 1.01%) with positive returns 13 out of 15 times! In addition to the positive tendency of markets on the first day of the new month, there has also been a clear tendency for the S&amp;P 500 to decline on the last trading day of the strong month. The average decline on the last trading day of a strong month has been 0.09% with positive returns less than half of the time. This is no doubt related to the fact that funds are forced to rebalance out of equities to get back inline with their benchmark weights. However, on those five prior months where the S&amp;P 500 bucked the trend and was positive on the last trading day of a 5%+ month, the average gain on the first trading day of the next month was even stronger at 1.52% with gains five out of six times.

# Alphabet, Inc. - 
&gt; **Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Monday, February 4, 2019. The consensus earnings estimate is $11.08 per share on revenue of $31.28 billion and the Earnings Whisper ¬Æ number is $11.03 per share. Investor sentiment going into the company's earnings release has 71% expecting an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are for year-over-year earnings growth of 14.23% with revenue decreasing by 3.23%. Short interest has decreased by 6.6% since the company's last earnings release while the stock has drifted higher by 6.7% from its open following the earnings release to be 0.7% below its 200 day moving average of $1,127.05.

If you could travel back in time to the 19th century, it would be very difficult to convince anyone that railroad investments were not the future of the stock market.

Governments were offering subsidies and land grants to stimulate rapid industry growth ‚Äì and in the period of 1868-1873, just after the American Civil War, an astonishing 33,000 miles of new railroad track were laid.

Entrepreneurs and financiers started betting on ambitious enterprises like the Northern Pacific Railway ‚Äì and as the transportation boom raged on, more than 60% of total U.S. stock market capitalization came from railroad related stocks.

We know today that the railroad boom didn‚Äôt live up to the expectations drawn out by speculators.

The valuations of all of those rail companies seem pretty absurd in hindsight, especially when looking at this week‚Äôs Chart of the Week on U.S. stock market history. It pulls numbers from Global Financial Data to contrast the relative sector weightings over 200 years.

While there are some obvious historical moments to be discovered on the chart, perhaps the most important lesson it demonstrates is the unpredictability of the market in general.

Science that is driven only by data, and not by human competitive nature, is always open, warm, and friendly. The data always speaks for itself. There is no need for a defense of data that is real. Pride does not belong in science. When human beings tell the truth, they are friendly, cooperative, open, and warm. When human beings do not tell the truth, they are arrogant, defensive, angry, and competitive. 

This is how we sort out all the bullshit: human drama from data itself. Let the data speak for itself. Allow studies of consciousness to continue without character assassination (debunking over skepticism).

Skepticism is healthy. It allows for doubt, but also the continuation of seeking more data.

Debunking is hateful. It is doubtful and controlling. Debunking (being overly critical without reasoning) does not allow for continuation of seeking more data. Debunking is psychological control. This is not science.

In science - the data always wins. Data is independent of interpretation. With enough data, and with a variety of independent sources of data, the truth becomes apparent.

There is no anger in science. There is only friendship and honesty. Science is DRIVEN by logic primarily, and then by data. If logic is not sound (as in competitive in nature, and not data driven), then the data will also not be sound.

There is no authority or authoritarianism in science. There is ONLY data and logic - and that‚Äôs it! All data and all logic remain independent of the individual. Pride and science are incompatible.

# **Jobs report removes some fear, but market still in 'tug of war' over how much growth is slowing  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/jobs-report-removes-some-fear-but-market-still-in-tug-of-war-over-how-much-growth-is-slowing.html)**
*****
&gt; After January's strong jobs report calmed some recession fears, investors will be picking through the next wave of earnings reports and economic data for clues on just how much the U.S. economy could be slowing.
*****
&gt; Dozens of earnings, from companies like Alphabet, Disney and Eli Lily, report in the week ahead, and there are just a few economic reports like trade data and ISM services on Tuesday. Investors will also be watching the outcome of Treasury auctions for $84 billion in Treasury notes and bonds Tuesday through Thursday, after the Fed's dovish tone helped put a lid on interest rates in the past week.
*****
&gt; Nearly half the S&amp;P 500 companies had reported for the fourth quarter by Friday morning, and 71 percent beat earnings estimates, while 62 percent have beaten revenue estimates. But earnings growth forecasts for the first quarter continue to decline as more companies report, and they are currently barely breaking even at under 1 percent growth, versus the 15 percent growth in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; ""Granted the more we hear from companies, and particularly in terms of their guidance and projections on revenues, things can slowly change. The first thing companies do is they stop spending money. Cap spending slows down, and if revenue growth does not pick up, they let people go. This is still wait and see,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the 304,000 jobs added in January did ease some concerns about a slowing economy, as did a stronger than expected ISM manufacturing report Friday. But the view of the first quarter is still unclear, as many economic reports were missed during the government shutdown. Economists expect growth in the first quarter of just above 2 percent, after growth of about 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; Stocks closed out January with a sharp gain on Thursday, and started February on Friday on a flattish note. The S&amp;P 500 has rebounded about 15 percent from its Dec. 24 closing low. Last month's 7.9 percent gain was the best performance for January in more than 30 years.
The old Wall Street adage says 'so goes January, so goes the year.' If that holds, stocks could finish 2019 higher. But February is another story, and on average, it is a flat month for the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; ""The tug of war that you saw in the market, that was going on in the last half of last year is playing out in the data. Some of the data is a bit lower, but some of the economic surprises are picking up to the upside rather than downside,"" said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the ISM may have improved but it reflected very low exports and flat backlogs, even though there was a snap back in new orders.
*****
&gt; ""I would fade the jobs report,"" said Boockvar, noting the level of growth may have been inflated by government workers taking on part-time jobs during the government shutdown.
*****
&gt; Boocvkar said the jobs report also looked strong on the surface, but he's concerned the unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent from 3.9 percent.
*****
&gt; ""The question of whether we go into a recession or not is how does the stock market affect confidence?"" Boockvar said. Confidence readings in the past week were low, and consumer sentiment Friday was its lowest since before President Donald Trump took office.
*****
&gt; Krosby said stocks could test recent lows or put in a higher low. If there's a big selloff, ""That would not necessarily mean it was a clue a recession is coming. It's just a normal testing mechanism,"" she said.
*****
&gt; The Fed removed a big concern from the markets in the past week, when its post-meeting statement and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's briefing tilted dovish, assuring markets the Fed would pause in its interest rate hiking. Investors had feared the Fed would hurt the softening economy with its rate hikes. Now, the biggest fears are about the trade war between the U.S. and China and slowing Chinese growth.
*****
&gt; The jobs report, and the ISM manufacturing data were also important because the lack of data during the government's 35 day shutdown has left gaps in the economic picture.
*****
&gt; ""This is really a sign the Fed stole the thunder from the economic data. By saying they're patient plasters over any kind of economic data in the near term, and I suspect the near term lasts through the first quarter because of the government shutdown, the weather, weak GDP,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
&gt; Chandler said the markets will be hanging on any news on the trade talks with China. ""Even if it's not the all encompassing trade deal we were promised, it's a return to where we were before with China promising to buy energy and farm products. We'll continue to have some kind of talks with the China, like we had under Obama and Bush,"" said Chandler.

# Now What?

&gt; What a year it has been. After the worst December for stocks in 87 years that contributed to the worst fourth quarter since the 2008‚Äì09 financial crisis, stocks have bounced back in spectacular fashion. In fact, with a day to go, stocks are looking at their best first month of the year in 30 years.

&gt; What could happen next? ‚ÄúWe like to say that the easy 10% has been made off the lows and the next 10% will be much tougher,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThings like Fed policy, China uncertainty, and overall global growth concerns all will play a part in where equity markets go from here.‚Äù

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index about 10% away from new highs, we do think new highs are quite possible at some point this year. Positive news from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and China trade talks, as well as the realization by investors that the odds of a recession in 2019 are quite low could spark potential new highs. Remember, fiscal spending as a percentage of overall gross domestic product (GDP) is higher this year than it was last year. Many think the tax cut and fiscal policies in play last year were a one-time sugar high. We don‚Äôt see it that way and expect the benefits from fiscal policy to help extend this economic cycle at least another year‚Äîlikely more.

&gt; As we head into February, note that it hasn‚Äôt been one of the best months for stocks. In fact, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, February has been virtually flat, and over the past 20 years only June and September have shown worse returns. Overall, the market gains have been quite impressive since the December 24 lows, but we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all to see a near-term consolidation or pullback.

# A Fed Pause and the Flattening Yield Curve

&gt; Investors have increasingly positioned for a Federal Reserve (Fed) pause, which could portend a shift in fixed income markets. Fed fund futures are pricing in about a 70% probability that the Fed will keep rates unchanged for the rest of 2019, and the market‚Äôs dovish tilt has weighed on short-term rates.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 2-year yield has typically followed the fed funds rate since policymakers began raising rates in December 2015. While we expect one or two more hikes this cycle, there is a possibility that the Fed‚Äôs December hike was its last, which will likely cap short-term rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Short-Term-Rates-Poin-to-Fed-Pause.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Short-term yields have outpaced longer-term yields over the past few years, flattening the yield curve and raising concerns that U.S. economic progress may not be able to keep up with the Fed‚Äôs tightening. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yield has fallen negative before every single U.S. recession since 1970.

&gt; If the Fed pauses, the curve will likely reverse course and steepen as solid economic growth and quickening (but manageable) inflation drives longer-term yields higher. As mentioned in our Outlook 2019, FUNDAMENTAL: How to Focus on What Really Matters in the Markets, we‚Äôre forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will increase significantly from current levels and trade within a range of 3.25‚Äì3.75% in 2019.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe remain optimistic about U.S. economic growth prospects, and recent data show inflation remains at manageable levels,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúBecause of this, we expect the data-dependent Fed to be less aggressive than initially feared, as policymakers juggle these factors with the impacts of trade tensions and tepid global growth.‚Äù

&gt; To be clear, investors shouldn‚Äôt fear a flattening yield curve given the backdrop of solid economic growth and modest inflation. Historically, the yield curve has remained relatively flat or inverted for years before some recessions started. Since 1970, the United States has entered a recession an average of 21 months after the yield curve inverted.

# Jobless Claims‚Äô Historic Significance

&gt; Jobless claims have dropped to a 49-year low. Based on historical trends, this could signal that a U.S. economic recession is further off than many expect.

&gt; Data released January 24 showed jobless claims fell to 199K in the week ending January 18, the lowest number since 1969 and far below consensus estimates of 218K. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, current jobless claims have been significantly lower than those in the 12-month periods preceding each recession since the early 1970s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/initial-jobless-claims-defy-recession-fears.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Jobless claims have fallen out of the spotlight as the economic cycle has matured, but they could prove important again as investors‚Äô recessionary fears increase. While most labor-market data serve as lagging indicators of U.S. economic health, jobless claims are a leading indicator. Historically, a 75‚Äì100K increase in claims over a 26-week period has been associated with a recession.

&gt; ‚ÄúLast week‚Äôs jobless claims print was particularly impressive given the partial government shutdown and weakening corporate sentiment,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúThe U.S. labor market remains strong and will help buoy consumer health and output growth this year.‚Äù

&gt; Other predictive data sets have signaled U.S. recessionary odds are low. Data last week showed the Conference Board‚Äôs Leading Economic Index (LEI), based on 10 leading economic indicators (like jobless claims, manufacturers‚Äô new orders, and stock prices), grew 4.3% year over year in December. In contrast, the LEI has turned negative year over year before all economic recessions since 1970. Because of its solid predictive ability, the LEI is a component of our Recession Watch Dashboard.

# Best S&amp;P January Since 1987

&gt; Most major U.S. stock indexes rallied to new recovery and year-to-date highs today shrugging off some misses and weakness from Microsoft, DuPont and Visa. S&amp;P 500 finished the month strong with a 7.9% gain. This is the best S&amp;P January since 1987. This is also the third January Trifecta in a row. 

&gt; Last year the S&amp;P 500 crumbled in the fourth quarter under the weight of triple threats from a hawkish and confusing Fed, a newly divided Congress and the U.S. trade battle with China, finishing in the red. 2017‚Äôs Trifecta was followed by a full-year gain of 19.4%, including a February-December gain of 17.3%. As you can see in the table below, the long term track record of the Trifecta is rather impressive, posting full-year gains in 27 of the 30 prior years with an average gain for the S&amp;P 500 of 17.1%. 

&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.5% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .739 batting average. 

&gt; Our January Indicator Trifecta combines the Santa Claus Rally, the First Five Days Early Warning System and our full-month January Barometer. The predicative power of the three is considerably greater than any of them alone; we have been rather impressed by its forecasting prowess. This is the 31st time since 1949 that all three January Indicators have been positive and the twelfth time (previous eleven times highlighted in grey in table below) this has occurred in a pre-election year.

&gt; With the Fed turning more dovish and President Trump tacking to the center and meeting with China and market internals improving along with the gains, the market is tracking Base Case and Best Case scenarios outlined in our 2019 Annual Forecast. Next eleven month and full-year 2019 performance is expected to be more in line with typical Pre-Election returns.

# February Almanac: Small-Caps Tend to Outperform

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is not all that stellar. February ranks no better than seventh and has posted paltry average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from ‚ÄúJanuary Effect‚Äù carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.1% in February since 1979‚Äîjust the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In pre-election years, February‚Äôs performance generally improves with average returns all positive. NASDAQ performs best, gaining an average 2.8% in pre-election-year Februarys since 1971. Russell 2000 is second best, averaging gains of 2.5% since 1979. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000, the large-cap indices, tend to lag with average advances of around 1.0%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/665b5c71c11ad02d59f9f633375cae36/tumblr_inline_pluyffMGPi1spdppr_400.jpg))**

# 5% Months

&gt; 7%? Bulls will take it! After an abysmal December, the S&amp;P 500 is currently set to finish the month with its best January return since 1987. This month‚Äôs gain will mark the 16th time since the lows of the Financial Crisis in March 2009 that the S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 5% in a given month. The table below highlights each of the 15 prior months where the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 5% and shows how much the S&amp;P 500 gained on the month as well as its performance on the last trading day of the month and the first trading day of the subsequent month.

&gt; When looking at the table, a few things stand out. First, the first trading day of a month that follows a month where the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 5% has been extremely positive as the S&amp;P 500 averages a gain of 0.84% (median: 1.01%) with positive returns 13 out of 15 times! In addition to the positive tendency of markets on the first day of the new month, there has also been a clear tendency for the S&amp;P 500 to decline on the last trading day of the strong month. The average decline on the last trading day of a strong month has been 0.09% with positive returns less than half of the time. This is no doubt related to the fact that funds are forced to rebalance out of equities to get back inline with their benchmark weights. However, on those five prior months where the S&amp;P 500 bucked the trend and was positive on the last trading day of a 5%+ month, the average gain on the first trading day of the next month was even stronger at 1.52% with gains five out of six times.

so i read that chapter 11 bankruptcy means they don't liquidate their assets but they do have to come up with a plan to reorganize and pay back debts. this implies that they believe they can still be profitable after X years when their plan has been executed.

my curiosity is about the stock before, during, and after. i would think it wise to buy in when they enter the bankruptcy but the uncertainty of if the company needs to use the stock to pay some of the debt would be key in deciding this (?).

Have been successfully trading stocks for the past 8 years now and looking to share and consume valuable information here.

The first stock I will analyse is Johnson &amp; Johnson - which in my view is a pharmaceutical plus! Apart from medicine this company also produces interesting consumer products focused on health and personal care. A few of their famous brands are: Band-Aid, Compeed, Listerine and Acavue. About 3/4 of their revenue consists of pharmaceutical products and medical aids.

It is a bit of a boring company, but it has a great management. Their return on equity has been above 25%(!) for years now. Their balance sheet is strong and they are a true dividend champion. They have had a rising dividend for the past 50 years and it is currently at around 3 dollars a share. On top of that the management has a nose for good acquisitions with which it adds to their already impressive line of products.

The last few years they have had a lot less trouble with expiring patents compared to Pfizer, one of their biggest competitors. For the years to come there are no patent expirations for important products. On top of that they have a bunch of interesting medicine in the pipeline, ready to enter the markets. A lot of those have their heritage in biotechnology which makes them a lot harder to counterfeit. A great example of this is the medicine Xarelto, a blood thinner they developed in cooperation with the German company Bayer.

The organic growth of the pharmaceutical part of the company is predicted to be around 6-7% in the years to come. In particular Xarelto, Invokana (diabetes medication) and Imbruvica (cancer medicine) are expected to be pulling the cart. The consumer products division might be affected by the strong dollar, but for European investors this should not be a problem. At the current price of $132 a share, Johnson &amp; Johnson is not expensive at a price/earnings ratio of 14.5 for 2019.

My account doesn't have margin approval or option approval.

I have been depositing money and then buying the next day. But is this a margin call?

Edit: I feel like I'm going to wake up with my entire account wiped out to zero. When I look on the TDA app. It says Option Buying Power: (-$86.97) in RED.... What the F' is going on.

# Apple stock rises despite revenue decline, downbeat outlook (MarketWatch)

**Article Link:** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-stock-rises-despite-revenue-decline-downbeat-outlook-2019-01-29](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-stock-rises-despite-revenue-decline-downbeat-outlook-2019-01-29)

**Summary:**

The key metric in Apple's AAPL, -1.04% fiscal first-quarter release was itsMarch-quarter revenue outlook, which came in at $55 billion to $59 billion.

Apple had preannounced the top-line number, calling for $84 billion in a letter to investors that it issued in early January.

Chief Executive Tim Cook said in Apple's release that while he was disappointed the company fell short of its initial revenue forecast for the holiday period, ""This quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide."" He said Apple has an installed base of 1.4 billion devices, ""An all-time high.""

Greater China accounted for $13.2 billion of the company's revenue in the period, compared with nearly $18 billion a year earlier.

Revenue from the company's iPhone business fell sharply as well, to $52 billion from $61.1 billion in the prior December period.

Apple's services revenue exceeded expectations by a hair, coming it at $10.9billion, compared with estimates for $10.8 billion.

Apple shares have fallen 27% over the past three months, while the Dow JonesIndustrial Average DJIA, +0.21% of which Apple is a component, has gained 0.6%

**Summary:**

EBay Inc. EBAY, -0.97% shares rose roughly 3% in the extended session Tuesday after the online retailer beat Wall Street earnings and sales expectations.

Adjusted for items such as changes to the U.S. tax code, among other things, earnings were 71 cents a share, compared with 59 cents a share in the year-ago period.

""We are confident in the strength of our business and future growth prospects, as demonstrated by our decision to institute eBay's first-ever dividend and increase our share repurchase program."" The company said that it is initiating a dividend of 14 cents a share, with the first quarterly payment to be paid aroundMarch 20 to shareholders of record on March 1.

EBay also said it expects to buy back $5 billion worth of stock in 2019.

For the first quarter, analysts model earnings of 61 cents on sales of $2.66billion.

For the full year, analysts estimate earnings of $2.59 a share and sales of$11.17 billion.

EBay said it expects first-quarter adjusted earnings of 62 cents to 64 cents a share and sales of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion; the company projects full-year adjusted earnings of $2.62 to $2.68 a share and sales of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion.

# A few of the secret portfolios Goldman gives clients are doubling the market's return this year (CNBC)

**Article Link**: [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/a-few-secret-goldman-portfolios-for-clients-are-doubling-the-return-of-the-market-so-far-this-year.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/a-few-secret-goldman-portfolios-for-clients-are-doubling-the-return-of-the-market-so-far-this-year.html)

**Summary:**

Goldman Sachs apparently knows the key to beating the market, but the bank is only telling its elite club.

The bank has created 39 portfolios exclusively for its clients, and 34 of them are outperforming the market this year while three are posting an 11 percent gain, more than doubling the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date return.

The three winning baskets are ""High revenue growth,"" ""High Sharpe ratio,"" and""Dual beta,"" according to a broad note to clients on Monday explaining the portfolios' constructions and growth outlooks.

Goldman has been handpicking stocks based on various proprietary themes and sectors for a decade, but these portfolios are only made available for its clients to trade on the Bloomberg terminal.

The bank treats the members of the baskets carefully and doesn't always disclose all the member stocks, even in its daily and weekly notes.

Along with good track records this month, the baskets also have solid long term track records.

The bank doesn't suggest buying and holding the various baskets all at the same time.

They recommend certain baskets at certain times based on the type of market environment.

Goldman warned clients at the end of last week about companies with big revenues from China, and specifically, Nvidia, days before the chipmaker released surprise disclosure on China slowdown and blew up its stock.

In the note, Goldman told clients to avoid its international sales basket and recommended its domestic sales basket instead for investors wanting to hedge against international risks.

# Indian home loan provider Dewan's shares slump over media report (Reuters)

**Article Link:** [https://in.reuters.com/article/dhfl-india/indian-home-loan-provider-dewans-shares-slump-over-media-report-idINKCN1PN1U0](https://in.reuters.com/article/dhfl-india/indian-home-loan-provider-dewans-shares-slump-over-media-report-idINKCN1PN1U0)

**Summary:**

NEW DELHI - Shares of home loan provider Dewan Housing Finance Corp fell 8percent on Tuesday following a media report that alleged financial misappropriation by the controlling shareholders of the company.

Dewan Housing, one of India's largest housing finance companies, said theCobrapost website's report ""Appears to have been done with a mala fide intent to cause damage to the goodwill and reputation"" and ""Resulting in erosion in shareholder value.""

In its online report, Cobrapost said publicly available data showed funds, including a large amount secured from Indian state banks, was diverted to shell companies in India and abroad to buy assets.

The website, which is best known for sting operations on businessmen, politicians and media houses, also said that the Wadhawans broke several laws governing companies.

India's Bank of Baroda said on Tuesday it had an exposure of 40 billion rupees to Dewan Housing and said it would have to look into the veracity of the allegations against the company.

Shares of Dewan Housing fell by as much as 12.3 percent to hit a low of 162.20rupees before recovering somewhat to close at 169.70 rupees, their lowest level in almost three years.

The shadow banking sector comprises around 11,400 firms with a combined balance-sheet worth more than 22 trillion Indian rupees.

If you look at the historical china revenue, the peak came way back in 2015. If you think from 10000ft, Apple has basically failed to establish an ecosystem in China. Chinese people are probably on other chinese mobile ecosystems etc. 

When I think of that these results seem even more ominous. This 27% fall in chinese holiday sales means that subsequent quarters are going to be worse. (And this is despite Apple crashing it's iphone prices in China). Failed hardware(iPhone) sales means that corresponding Life time value sales from apple's eco-system... like music itunes etc are going to be go down (impact will be in future earnings).

Wait. What???

So AAPL basically hit the guidance (slight beat but very very slight) that was the exact same guidance that DROPPED it from 160 down to 142, but instead it's up to 163? WHAT? 

How tf is this actually seen as positive? If anything wouldn't hitting those numbers justify the price AAPL was at after TC originally brought this to light hence 142?
