I have certain criteria for stocks to be considered as a trade on earnings release results. Mainly the trend of the stock and the market as a whole are going in the same direction as the earnings release. Positive for positive and negative for negative. Of course sometimes I am wrong and sometimes things do happen as in the stock goes in the opposite direction for some reason.

However today is another day and there are a lot of earnings reports  along with a rising market!

Following the market I have chosen four stocks that I think are probable trades.

First Hasbro (HAS) although the trend has been down on this stock, earnings are expected to be positive however I will only trade this if pre-market is above 3%

Kimberly Clark Crop (KMB) Great uptrend plus expected positive earnings and a rising market makes this close to my top pick.

United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) again a nice uptrend with expected earnings to be good.

Finally my Star pick for the day:

McDonald's Corp (MCD) I expect MCD to do very well and I will be keeping a close eye on earnings and pre-market.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Well worth it! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find what I needed, which was a real time strategy. This is when I went on youtube and typed ""daytrading strategies."" The idea obviously being to find someone more experienced who'd be willing to share their strategies. Tim sykes strategies are great and they appear to work, but they aren't for me. I stumbled on warrior. Now spending an extra $200 a month was kind of ridiculous, seeing as I've only made a few trades since following tim. I've been treating it like school where you get educated, get a degree, then work. 

Since joining the warrior room last month, I've made a few successful trades and a few unsuccessful ones. Unfortunately, they didn't pan out like I expected. My emotions got the best of me, and I ended up losing on them. Circling back to warrior, he calls out his positions live, which is useful to see what his though process is and emulate it. I'm never quick enough to get my orders in. By the time I hear the call, I'm not able to fill the order fast enough. I usually use a market order, which allows a trader to get a quicker order. I've been reluctant to use stop orders. 

Now, my question to you all is this, since tim and warrior have different trading methods, which is the more profitable one long-term. Meaning which can make me serious cash quicker. I know it sounds selly, but I'm genuinely curious which style is better to learn.

(Reuters) - Boeing Co may have to book billions of dollars in additional charges related to its parked 737 MAX jets, brokerages said on Monday, citing fresh uncertainty over the time frame for lifting a safety ban imposed after deadly crashes.

Boeing booked a $5.6 billion pre-tax charge in the second quarter and in July had estimated the total cost of the MAX grounding to be more than $8 billion.

""On October 1, 2019, Switch, Inc. (the “Company”) issued an aggregate of 2,438,454 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Shares”) to certain members of Switch, Ltd. (the “Operating Company”) in connection with the exercise by such members of their respective redemption right for an equivalent number of common units of the Operating Company (the “Units”) and corresponding cancellation of an equivalent number of the Company’s Class B common stock. The Company elected to settle such redemption payment by issuance of the Shares. The redemption occurred pursuant to the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Operating Company entered into in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “Operating Agreement”). Pursuant to the redemption, the Company canceled its Class B common stock (one share for each of the Units) owned by such members. The Shares were issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on the basis that it did not involve a public offering.""

So in simple terms, the 2.4 million Class A shares  offered are non-dilutive because they cancelled an equal amount of Class B shares.  Correct?  I'm unsure of the ""cancellation"" process as well...but that may be answered in my next question.

http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/4/summary2/?id=6888416

In the days after the 8-K was filed there was a lot (relatively) of ""Insider Selling"" headlines.  http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/4/summary2/?id=6888416

In this one, the guy was said to have sold roughly 2.4 million common shares, and approx. 800,000 shares were converted from Class B, to Class A.  

Is the cancellation of Class B shares automatic after the 8-K is filed?  Or will they only be cancelled if and when the holders make rhe decision to convert their shares?

I've been trading the Canadian Cannabis market for \~3 years now and have done quite well, but sold all my previous holdings (long) at the peak. Held cash for a few months while analyzing my next buy, which was LABS (majority).

The last year of trading was all about volume, press releases, and multiples - sadly the wild west is over now (hope you were able to take advantage of that term) and the market is now looking for real Revs on the balance sheets. This is why I wanted to get opinions on LABS. They cleared $31MM in Rev last ER and their next ER is coming Nov 12, 2019.

They are one of the first companies I've noticed that have a solid business model and their timing in the market is impeccable - re: Oct 17 Edible market release - coming into the 'Cannabis 2.0' market with a line of products/services that the large LP's don't have internal access to, so said LP's are giving large quantities to LABS for tolling.

The kicker: Health Canada has seen a significant influx of Hemp Cultivation License applications this season - as long as you have land and no criminal record you can easily get approved - but most were given too late in the season for farmers to plant hemp, thus the 2020 season will have an oversupply of hemp (driving prices down of the raw commodity). This is where I see LABS taking off, specifically within the CBD product category that is seemingly very popular with consumers globally.

(OTCQB: KULR) (the “Company” or “KULR”), a leading developer of battery safety and thermal management technologies, announced that it has completed first phase development for an upcoming NASA high-voltage battery safety guide.

The NASA guide will outline the safety features of the most common commercial-off-the-shelf lithium ion battery cells as well as why and how they can fail, causing a dangerous reaction known as thermal runaway. KULR advised that internal safety devices did not adequately protect the cells from catastrophic events, specifically in cases of overcharging or in high-voltage, high-capacity configurations. KULR’s research and technical expertise in battery safety contributed to the findings in the NASA guide.

The NASA safety guide is intended to assist NASA engineers, designers and others develop and deploy energy storage and power sources for future products and missions, including NASA’s next generation space suit, which is expected to include high-capacity battery packs. NASA seeks to establish design guidelines for an advanced lithium ion spacesuit battery module that is lightweight, compact, and passively resistant to propagation or thermal runaway due to a single cell hazard.

“If there’s one place that battery failure can be catastrophic, it’s in a space suit, or in an environment where response and assistance options are limited or non-existent,” said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR Technology. “That’s why we’re continuing to work with NASA, and other partners where battery safety and performance are mission-critical, to understand and ultimately prevent these dangerous battery incidents.” 

This work continues and builds on KULR’s pioneering battery and thermal management collaborations with NASA. Most notably, [**KULR’s thermal runaway shield (TRS)**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lMgCUaW9Qu_X1DUt5z8wSysHw0HliFbK97fDTLzJM2vk50AreU4g1VPZJKQDe-9Cl6TbPzj8LGtt2Vkk9ZSvjVc8oqws56lMnMfogzHpoucy0v3n2nTAUcyIj6euQWWnBw7JA2QvWtwArUUfQgFtIhWpVOLE8vDuGzEoK2MHHnU=), has been shown in government and lab testing to stop or mitigate the impacts of thermal runaway in batteries.

We begin by examining Netflix, which historically has been losing money, yet has an astronomical valuation based on a high multiple, and it is clear that the high multiple is ""justified"" because of the new space and perceived growth that Netflix has due to the relatively new industry.  We then can look at Disney and Apple and see that they are valued at lower multiples because they operate in different spaces (Disney in entertainment/media and Apple in tech/services).  However, these two companies are poised to be strong contenders in the streaming space.

That being said, it looks like Apple and Disney have a high growth trajectory in this new industry which does not seem to be reflected in their valuations.

Most probably know this info already, so for those who don’t here ya go:\n\n\nContract Pricing\n\nOption premiums are derived from two things: intrinsic value (the option’s inherent value) and time value (the additional premium that is priced into the option). The only factor that influences an option’s intrinsic value is the underlying stock’s price vs. the option’s strike price. Time value is influenced by various factors such as time until expiration, stock price, strike price and interest rates; however, the primary factor influencing time value is the implied volatility. Implied volatility fluctuates the same way prices do; it is relative to the underlying stock and how volatile it is.\n\nExample: Suppose a $50 call option was purchased at a price of $14; currently, the stock is trading at a price of $60 per share.\nIntrinsic Value: Since the share price is above the $50 strike price, the owner can exercise the option and buy the stock for $50 per share and immediately sell the stock for $60. The intrinsic value of an option is the difference between the strike price and the price of the stock, which in this case is $10.\nTime Value: This is the additional premium that is priced into an option, which represents the amount of time left until expiration. Since the option is priced at $14, the option premium is priced at $4 more than the intrinsic value.\n\nImpact of Implied Volatility\n\nImpact on Premium: Implied volatility represents the anticipated volatility of a stock over the life of the option. As these expectations change, so do the options premiums. As expectations / demand for an option increases, the implied volatility will also rise resulting in high-priced premiums. The opposite is also true, options with lower implied volatility will carry cheaper option prices. In order to make a successful premium trade, buy an option with low implied volatility and sell the option when the implied volatility increases.\n\nImpact on Option Duration: Different types of options result in different reactions to implied volatility. Short-dated options will be less sensitive to implied volatility. Long-dated options will be more sensitive to implied volatility. This is because long-dated options have more time value priced into them whereas short-dated options have less. In order to make a successful premium trade for a short-dated option, buy an option with a higher intrinsic value because time value is less priced in. In order to make a successful premium trade for a long-dated option, buy an option with a low implied volatility because the time value is more priced in; when implied volatility begins to increase, the higher sensitivity will result in a larger, more dramatic premium increase.\n\nImpact on Strike Price: Each strike price will respond differently to changes in implied volatility. Near The Money (NTM) options are most sensitive to changes in implied volatility while options that are further Outside The Money (OTM) or further Inside The Money (ITM) be less sensitive to implied volatility changes.\n\nImplied Volatility and Forecasting: Before initiating an options play, it is beneficial to establish an implied volatility range for the option you will be trading in order to determine what you consider to be low premiums (for buying the contract) and high premiums (for selling the contract) for that specific stock option (it is good practice to also find the mean). Implied volatility moves in cycles, high volatility periods are followed by low volatility periods and vice versa. Investors can use these ranges in order to determine the best time to enter a trade, forecasting is then used to determine a higher implied volatility to exit the trade at. It is important to consider the following when forecasting implied volatility:\n- Determine whether the implied volatility is high or low and whether it is rising or falling. As implied volatility reaches extreme highs or lows, it is likely to revert back to its mean.\n- It is not uncommon to see implied volatility plateau at highs, check the news and research the company as this can happen ahead of earnings, mergers/acquisitions, and product approvals.\n- Consider selling strategies when options are trading with high implied volatility because options premiums will be more expensive.\n- Consider buying strategies when options are trading with low implied volatility because options premiums will be less expensive.\n\nThe Greeks\n\nThe Greeks are a set of risk measures that indicated how exposed an option is to time value decay, implied volatility, and pricing changes in an underlying security. There are five Greek risk measures: Delta, Theta, Vega, Gamma, and Rho:\n\nDelta: This is a measure of the change in an option’s price or premium resulting from a change in the underlying asset. A high Delta option’s premium will increase more than a low Delta option’s premium for every $1 the stock gains; a high Delta option’s premium will also fall more than a low Delta option’s premium for every $1 the stock loses. For example, if the Delta is 0.6 then for every $1 the stock rises the premium will rise $0.60. Delta is also commonly used when determining the likelihood of an option being ITM at expiration. For example, an OTM call option with a 0.20 Delta has roughly a 20% chance of being ITM at expiration, whereas a deep ITM call option with a 0.95 Delta has a roughly 95% chance of being ITM at expiration. Lastly, Delta is used when determining directional risk. Positive Deltas are long (buy) market assumptions and negative Deltas are short (sell) market assumptions. Neutral Deltas are neutral market assumptions. There are three main things to keep in mind when considering Delta:\n- Delta tends to increase as expiration approaches for near or ATM options.\n- Delta is further evaluated by Gamma, which measures Delta’s rate of change.\n- Delta can also change in reaction to implied volatility changes.\n\nGamma: This measures Delta’s rate of change over time as well as the rate of change in the underlying asset. Gamma is used to help forecast price moves in the underlying asset. Since Delta values are constantly changing with the underlying asset’s price, Gamma is used to measure the rate of change and provide traders with an idea of what to expect in the future. Since Gamma is a constant that represents the rate of change of Delta, it is useful for determining the stability of Delta, which can be used to determined the likelihood of an option reaching the strike price at expiration. A good way to think of Gamma is the measure of the stability of an option’s probability. If Delta represents the probability of being ITM at expiration, Gamma represents the stability of that probability over time. Gamma values are highest for ATM options and lowest for deep ITM or OTM options. For example, suppose that two options have the same Delta value but one option has a high Gamma and one has a low Gamma. The option with the higher Gamma will have a higher risk since an unfavorable move in the underlying asset will have an oversized impact. High Gamma values mean that the option tends to experience volatile swings, which is a bad thing for most traders looking for predictable opportunities. An option with a high Gamma and a 0.75 Delta may have less of a chance of expiring ITM than a low Gamma option with the same Delta. There are three additional things to keep in mind when considering Gamma:\n- Gamma is the smallest for deep OTM and deep IMT options.\n- Gamma is highest when the option gets near the money.\n- Gamma is positive for long options and negative for short options.\n\nTheta: This measures the rate of time decay in the value of an option or its premium. Time decay is the erosion of an option’s value from the passage of time. As time passes, the chance of an option being profitable or ITM lessens. Time decay tends to accelerate as the expiration date of an option draws closer because there’s less time left to earn a profit from the trade. Theta is always negative for a single option since time moves in the same direction. Theta is good for sellers and bad for buyers. For example, assume an investor is long an option with a Theta of -0.50. The option’s price would decrease by $0.50 every day that passes, all else being equal. There are three additional things to keep in mind when considering Theta:\n- Theta can be high for OTM options if they carry a lot of implied volatility.\n- Theta is typically highest for ATM options since less time is needed to earn a profit with a price move in the underlying stock.\n- Theta will increase sharply as time decay accelerates in the last few weeks before expiration and can severely undermine a long option holder’s position, especially if implied volatility declines at the same time.\n\nVega: This measures the risk of changes in implied volatility or the forward-looking expected volatility of the underlying asset price. Vega represents the amount that an option contract’s price changes in reaction to a 1% change in the implied volatility of the underlying asset. While Delta measures the actual price changes, Vega is focused on changes in expectations for future volatility. Higher volatility makes options more expensive since there is a greater likelihood of hitting the strike price at some point. Vega tells us approximately how much an option will increase or decrease in the level of implied volatility. Option sellers benefit from a fall in implied volatility, and option buyers benefit from a rise in implied volatility. Long option traders benefit from pricing being bid up, and short option traders benefit from prices being dig down. This is why long options have a positive Vega and short options have a negative Vega. For example, if the Vega is 0.25 and the implied volatility increase by 1%, then the option’s bid-ask price should increase by $0.25. If the Vega of an option is greater than the bid-ask spread, then the option is said to offer a competitive spread. This is just one consideration, as too high of a spread could make getting into and out of trades more difficult and/or costly. There are three additional points to keep in mind when considering Vega:\n- Vega can increase or decrease without price changes of the underlying asset, due to changes in implied volatility.\n- Vega can increase in reaction to quick moves in the underlying asset.\n- Vega falls as the option gets closer the expiration.\n\nRho: This measures the change in option premium due to interest rates. For example, if Rho is 0.25 and interest rates are increased by 1%, the price of the contract would increase by 0.25 / $25. If interest rates are decreased by 1%, the price of the contract would decrease by 0.25 / $25.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nClarification per u/NotMeLa\n\ngamma changes dynamically together with delta as underlying asset value changes; it is not constant. Delta cannot change without gamma also changing.\n\nBecause of this, you actually contradict yourself later when you state that gamma is lowest when the option is deep ITM/OTM (which is correct), where time value is negligible and changes to option value happen due to changes in intrinsic value, which in turn happens due to changes in underlying asset value.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a few posts of people wanting to learn more, so I decided to share this information I’ve put together. Most probably know this info already, so for those who don’t here ya go:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contract Pricing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option premiums are derived from two things: intrinsic value (the option’s inherent value) and time value (the additional premium that is priced into the option). The only factor that influences an option’s intrinsic value is the underlying stock’s price vs. the option’s strike price. Time value is influenced by various factors such as time until expiration, stock price, strike price and interest rates; however, the primary factor influencing time value is the implied volatility. Implied volatility fluctuates the same way prices do; it is relative to the underlying stock and how volatile it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example: Suppose a $50 call option was purchased at a price of $14; currently, the stock is trading at a price of $60 per share.\nIntrinsic Value: Since the share price is above the $50 strike price, the owner can exercise the option and buy the stock for $50 per share and immediately sell the stock for $60. The intrinsic value of an option is the difference between the strike price and the price of the stock, which in this case is $10.\nTime Value: This is the additional premium that is priced into an option, which represents the amount of time left until expiration. Since the option is priced at $14, the option premium is priced at $4 more than the intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impact of Implied Volatility&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impact on Premium: Implied volatility represents the anticipated volatility of a stock over the life of the option. As these expectations change, so do the options premiums. As expectations / demand for an option increases, the implied volatility will also rise resulting in high-priced premiums. The opposite is also true, options with lower implied volatility will carry cheaper option prices. In order to make a successful premium trade, buy an option with low implied volatility and sell the option when the implied volatility increases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impact on Option Duration: Different types of options result in different reactions to implied volatility. Short-dated options will be less sensitive to implied volatility. Long-dated options will be more sensitive to implied volatility. This is because long-dated options have more time value priced into them whereas short-dated options have less. In order to make a successful premium trade for a short-dated option, buy an option with a higher intrinsic value because time value is less priced in. In order to make a successful premium trade for a long-dated option, buy an option with a low implied volatility because the time value is more priced in; when implied volatility begins to increase, the higher sensitivity will result in a larger, more dramatic premium increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impact on Strike Price: Each strike price will respond differently to changes in implied volatility. Near The Money (NTM) options are most sensitive to changes in implied volatility while options that are further Outside The Money (OTM) or further Inside The Money (ITM) be less sensitive to implied volatility changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Implied Volatility and Forecasting: Before initiating an options play, it is beneficial to establish an implied volatility range for the option you will be trading in order to determine what you consider to be low premiums (for buying the contract) and high premiums (for selling the contract) for that specific stock option (it is good practice to also find the mean). Implied volatility moves in cycles, high volatility periods are followed by low volatility periods and vice versa. Investors can use these ranges in order to determine the best time to enter a trade, forecasting is then used to determine a higher implied volatility to exit the trade at. It is important to consider the following when forecasting implied volatility:\n- Determine whether the implied volatility is high or low and whether it is rising or falling. As implied volatility reaches extreme highs or lows, it is likely to revert back to its mean.\n- It is not uncommon to see implied volatility plateau at highs, check the news and research the company as this can happen ahead of earnings, mergers/acquisitions, and product approvals.\n- Consider selling strategies when options are trading with high implied volatility because options premiums will be more expensive.\n- Consider buying strategies when options are trading with low implied volatility because options premiums will be less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Greeks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Greeks are a set of risk measures that indicated how exposed an option is to time value decay, implied volatility, and pricing changes in an underlying security. There are five Greek risk measures: Delta, Theta, Vega, Gamma, and Rho:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Delta: This is a measure of the change in an option’s price or premium resulting from a change in the underlying asset. A high Delta option’s premium will increase more than a low Delta option’s premium for every $1 the stock gains; a high Delta option’s premium will also fall more than a low Delta option’s premium for every $1 the stock loses. For example, if the Delta is 0.6 then for every $1 the stock rises the premium will rise $0.60. Delta is also commonly used when determining the likelihood of an option being ITM at expiration. For example, an OTM call option with a 0.20 Delta has roughly a 20% chance of being ITM at expiration, whereas a deep ITM call option with a 0.95 Delta has a roughly 95% chance of being ITM at expiration. Lastly, Delta is used when determining directional risk. Positive Deltas are long (buy) market assumptions and negative Deltas are short (sell) market assumptions. Neutral Deltas are neutral market assumptions. There are three main things to keep in mind when considering Delta:\n- Delta tends to increase as expiration approaches for near or ATM options.\n- Delta is further evaluated by Gamma, which measures Delta’s rate of change.\n- Delta can also change in reaction to implied volatility changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gamma: This measures Delta’s rate of change over time as well as the rate of change in the underlying asset. Gamma is used to help forecast price moves in the underlying asset. Since Delta values are constantly changing with the underlying asset’s price, Gamma is used to measure the rate of change and provide traders with an idea of what to expect in the future. Since Gamma is a constant that represents the rate of change of Delta, it is useful for determining the stability of Delta, which can be used to determined the likelihood of an option reaching the strike price at expiration. A good way to think of Gamma is the measure of the stability of an option’s probability. If Delta represents the probability of being ITM at expiration, Gamma represents the stability of that probability over time. Gamma values are highest for ATM options and lowest for deep ITM or OTM options. For example, suppose that two options have the same Delta value but one option has a high Gamma and one has a low Gamma. The option with the higher Gamma will have a higher risk since an unfavorable move in the underlying asset will have an oversized impact. High Gamma values mean that the option tends to experience volatile swings, which is a bad thing for most traders looking for predictable opportunities. An option with a high Gamma and a 0.75 Delta may have less of a chance of expiring ITM than a low Gamma option with the same Delta. There are three additional things to keep in mind when considering Gamma:\n- Gamma is the smallest for deep OTM and deep IMT options.\n- Gamma is highest when the option gets near the money.\n- Gamma is positive for long options and negative for short options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Theta: This measures the rate of time decay in the value of an option or its premium. Time decay is the erosion of an option’s value from the passage of time. As time passes, the chance of an option being profitable or ITM lessens. Time decay tends to accelerate as the expiration date of an option draws closer because there’s less time left to earn a profit from the trade. Theta is always negative for a single option since time moves in the same direction. Theta is good for sellers and bad for buyers.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 21st, 2019.

# **Stocks will likely hit new records in the week ahead if earnings keep topping expectations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/stocks-go-for-all-time-highs-next-week-as-the-earnings-season-continues.html)**
*****
Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&amp;P 500 companies get set to report.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both around 1% below their all-time highs while the Nasdaq Composite is about 2% away from its record. The indexes got a lift this after a big chunk of this week’s reporters posted better-than-expected results. They were also boosted by improving sentiment around Brexit and U.S.-China trade negotiations.
*****
&gt; The all-time highs could be tested as about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies, or around 24%, are scheduled to release their quarterly results in the week ahead. Some of those companies include Caterpillar and Boeing, both of which are expected to report Wednesday before the bell. Amazon, Intel, McDonald’s and Chipotle Mexican Grill are also on deck for the week.
*****
&gt; “You’ve got the potential for a combination of things that drive us to new highs,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “At the same time you’re getting better micro data in the earnings, you’re getting better news on the macro hurdles facing us.”
*****
&gt; More than 14% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported through Friday, FactSet data shows. Of those companies, 81% posted earnings that beat analyst expectations.
*****
&gt; J.P. Morgan Chase’s report on Tuesday sent the stock to an all-time high while Citigroup and Bank of America also got a boost from their earnings releases. Netflix, meanwhile, briefly rallied around 7% Thursday before ending the session up 2.5%. Morgan Stanley advanced 1.5% on earnings. Coca-Cola climbed more than 1% on Friday after releasing its quarterly numbers.
*****
&gt; To be sure, the companies are being rated on a very low bar this earnings season. Analysts polled by FactSet expected third-quarter earnings to have fallen by 4.6%.
*****
&gt; “Earnings can be a positive catalyst to the extent that expectations are pretty low,” said Dan Russo, chief market strategist at Chaikin Analytics. “The bar has been lowered to the point where companies can jump over it.”
*****
&gt; But investors might have a harder time digesting the week’s reports.
*****
&gt; Companies such as Caterpillar are heavily affected by the U.S.-China trade war given their exposure to overseas markets. Boeing and Intel also have overseas exposure. Meanwhile, reports from companies such as Amazon, McDonald’s and Chipotle will be heavily scrutinized as investors look for clues on how the consumer is doing.
*****
&gt; “Trade frictions and the global economic slowdown have clearly affected 2019 earnings growth thus far,” Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a note. “The third-quarter earnings reporting season will likely confirm that those negatives continued to pour over into last quarter’s results.”
*****
&gt; The good news for investors is recent trade talks appear to have yielded some progress. President Donald Trump announced Oct. 11 the U.S. and China had reached a “very substantial phase one” deal. Multiple reports this week said China wants additional talks before signing off on the first phase, but National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Thursday there is “a lot of momentum” to finalize the deal.
*****
&gt; John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said the “narrative” around trade had gotten “so one-sided to the negative side, there may be a better chance than not that a phase-one deal is signed.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, preliminary figures on consumer sentiment showed a slight increase in October from September. The final consumer sentiment numbers for the month are scheduled for release on Friday.
*****
&gt; “If corporate earnings show signs of resilience, especially by the U.S. consumer, then a run to new highs is by no means out of the question,” Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, said in a note.

# The Calendar Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain

&gt; Stocks have continued their surprising strength in October, thanks to a potential thaw in the U.S.-China trade dispute. And remember, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been lower in October during a pre-election year only once since 1987. Additionally, over the past 20 years, October has been the third-best month on average for the S&amp;P 500. October has had a bad rap due to some spectacular crashes, but the truth is the month usually is pretty good for stocks.

&gt; “The calendar could be about to turn into a bull’s best friend, as late October has been when stocks historically started their end-of-year rally,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “No two years are ever the same, and we all remember last year’s sell-off. However, a better than expected earnings season, coupled with positive steps on trade and one more Federal Reserve rate cut this year could allow bulls to smile the rest of 2019.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, we are very near the historically strong end of year for equities. Whether you look at the average year or a pre-election year, stocks have tended to deliver an upward bias starting soon.

# Buy in October, and Get Yourself Sober

&gt; Folks have become fixated with “Sell In May” but forget to “Buy in October, and Get Yourself Sober.” Our Best Six Months MACD Buy Signal that triggered last Friday, October 11th, initially appears to be timely. Friday’s Alert detailed several trades that were deployed Monday and updated in a follow up Alert on Monday. In addition to the Seasonal Sector ETF trades and the Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy Portfolio trades in DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM we released a New October Stock Basket yesterday!

&gt; As you can see in the chart below of the S&amp;P 500 the MACD “Buy” indicator trigger in the lower pane, highlighted in the yellow box with the black arrow, came in strong below the zero line. In the upper pane resistance at 3010 still persists. Aside from this resistance technically things look encouraging. We held support last August above 2815 and have been making higher lows since then, riding the 200-day moving average higher. The 50-day moving average has also constructively turned higher.

&gt; As we have been monitoring all year, seasonal patterns for the Pre-Election remain on track, though the October dip came early. Save some truly negative news, the low for the year is likely in. With the market tracking this seasonal pattern so closely all year that suggests the pattern is likely to continue, which means some backing and filing around S&amp;P 3000 through late November before additional new highs toward yearend.

# Bonds Bounce Back In Fund Flows Data

&gt; The week ended October 9th saw relatively large inflows into bond funds and relatively large outflows from equity funds. Across all mutual and exchange traded funds, equity flows were in the 7th percentile of all readings since 2013, with outflows of $11.5bn. Of that total, $5.8bn was ETFs, with the lion’s share of equity fund outflows coming from domestic funds. As has so frequently been the case lately, bond funds were the exact opposite situation. Total bond fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs meant $5.8bn of new cash on the week, which is in the 64th percentile of all periods. ETFs were relatively stronger, with bond funds drawing $1.9bn of inflows, higher than more than 81% of periods since 2013. Within both ETF and combined mutual and ETF flows, municipal bonds were the standouts, with total flows in the top 10% of all periods. Since 2013, $152bn has flowed into mutual funds and ETFs that own municipal government bonds, with more than $90bn of that coming since the end of 2017. Those flows are very likely being driven by tax-advantaged buying incentivized by the changes to the tax code at the end of 2017 which ended a variety of popular state and local tax deductions.

# ISM Offsides, If Not Utterly Incorrect

&gt; This week’s manufacturing activity releases from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed a slightly weaker but generally upbeat assessment of economic activity. The numbers from these two regional surveys may not be fully representative of the aggregate national economy, but they’re usually a pretty good indicator. As shown in the chart below, they’ve been a decent guide to what the ISM Manufacturing index says about national activity since the Empire State manufacturing index started its releases in 2001.

&gt; Unlike these two indices, which have shown a general uptick in activity over the last few months, the ISM index shows a different route. But that data isn’t backed up by the average results across the five Fed districts that survey their manufacturers. The size and scale of the divergence is so big that one of these indices is almost certainly wrong, but which?

&gt; For a tiebreaker, Markit’s manufacturing survey suggests conditions are at multi-month highs and picking up, more consistent with the data from Fed surveys than ISM. Markit’s sample size is bigger and the index is more representative of the whole sector than ISM only; with all five regional Fed surveys in the mix, they also have a sample size advantage over ISM. Hard data of late (including manufacturing production, exports, and hiring) has all sided against ISM and is showing data more consistent with the Five Fed or Markit surveys. For now, it looks like the brutal ISM results are a bit overstated.

# Nasadaq - One Downtrend Down, Another To Go

&gt; In a post yesterday, we discussed the seemingly never-ending rangebound trading pattern for the STOXX 600. It's not just Europe either. Seemingly everywhere you look these days, there's a major equity index stuck in some sort of range. The Nasdaq is just one example of many. At a level of around 8,140, the Nasdaq is at the same level it was at exactly six months ago and also all the way back in August of last year.

&gt; Last week at this time, things were looking good for the Nasdaq as the index had bounced off of support at its 200-DMA and broke its short-term downtrend from the September lower high. This week has seen further gains with the Nasdaq rising more than 1%, but that rally looks to have stalled out yesterday right at another downtrend from the July high. A meaningful break of that downtrend would come into play at around 8,200 which is just over half of one percent above current levels. Using our Trend Analyzer tool, of the 100 stocks in the Nasdaq 100, heading into today, 43 were overbought and just five were oversold, so it may take a few days of 'rest' for the index before a meaningful break of that downtrend can occur.

# Rangebound on Both Sides of the Atlantic

&gt; Everyone here is well aware of the fact that equities have been stuck in what seems like an endless trading range where the S&amp;P 500 has failed to break out meaningfully to new highs. What some investors may not be of cognizant of is the fact that over in Europe, the benchmark STOXX 600 has also been stuck in a trading range of its own. While the index peaked at higher levels in 2015, it subsequently fell over 25% during the global sell-off in late 2015/early 2016. From those lows, the STOXX rallied more than 30% for the next 15 months. Since May 2017, though, the index has been stuck in a range and unable to meaningfully break out to new highs.

&gt; This year's performance for the STOXX 600 has been a continuation of the holding pattern that the index has been stuck in since 2017. Earlier today, it looked as though we were getting close to a breakout as the index hit a 52-week high, but late in the European session equities sold-off nearly 1% from the intraday highs finishing near the lows of the day. Oh well. Maybe tomorrow.

&gt; What bulls in Europe are hoping is that today's late-day sell-off isn't a repeat of what happened on July 25th. Back then, we saw a similar-looking breakout, but like today, the gains didn't hold and the STOXX 600 reversed over 1% and finished near the lows of the day. From the high on the day of that failed breakout in late July to the August lows, the STOXX 600 went on to fall nearly 9%.

# S&amp;P 500 Sector Valuations

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month P/E ratio has ticked up to 19.62 recently, which is close to its highest level of the past year. For valuations to stop expanding on any breakout higher for the S&amp;P, we'll need to see earnings (the ""E"" in P/E) keep up with price. That's going to be a tough ask for corporate America this quarter, so we may be heading into 2020 with valuations at more concerning levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/spxpe.png))**

&gt; Below are one-year charts of P/E ratios for ten S&amp;P 500 sectors. These charts are included in our weekly Sector Snapshot report sent to Bespoke Premium members. Consumer Discretionary has the highest P/E ratio at 24.15 followed by Technology at 23.38. Tech's P/E has really jumped a lot recently to new 52-week highs. The Financial sector has the lowest P/E of the major sectors at just 13.27.

# Open Season For Small Caps

&gt; There’s been chatter for many moons about the under performance of small cap stocks recently. True they have been under performing since the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks hit its all-time high close over a year ago on August 31, 2018. However, the trend of under performance tracks the historical small cap seasonality quite well.

&gt; With the Russell 2000 up a fraction today as the major U.S. large indices were down a bit from our historical seasonal pattern perspective this looks like the beginning of the bottom of small cap under performance and the beginning of the new “Small Effect.”

&gt; As you can see in the accompanying chart the R2K has been tracking the pattern quite well since July and looks like the small fry are coming out of hibernation just in time for small cap stock hunting season.

&gt; See page 110 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019 and page 112 of the soon-to-be released 2020 edition for deep background.

# October Back on Track – Earnings Season Ramps Up

&gt; After a bumpy start, the market is back on track at the mid-point of October. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are slightly above average at this point in the month compared to the last 21-year historical average. NASDAQ is comfortably above average and continues to lead. Negative headlines have given way to more upbeat news. Trade headlines are now featuring some progress even though tariffs remain in place and third quarter earnings season is underway with a solid report from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) today. Provided economic data and corporate earnings hold up, the market is likely to continue its run toward all-time highs and October could end with above average gains.

It’s a plan of attack that Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey has promoted since his days as COO: Coke must become a “total beverage company” if it wants to accelerate its growth globally. Not abandon the Coke name of course, just broaden the product portfolio in a manner not seen since its founding in 1892.

What that has meant for Coke (KO) under Quincey’s leadership is the introduction of mini cans of full-calorie soda to cater to consumers that want some sugar, but not a ton of sugar. It has meant lime-flavored Diet Coke in slim cans, because millennials are demanding flavors without the calories. It has meant signing off on a 2020 U.S. launch (at long last) on a Coke-branded energy drink that takes aim at that surging market. Coke’s new energy drink has already debuted in 25 European countries.

Earnings season kicked off in earnest on Tuesday with strong results from JP Morgan that were taken as a good omen for the economy in general and commercially focused banks in particular.  However, for me, the stand out bank reporting this week was **Pinnacle Financial Partners** which reported a 19% increase in Q3 EPS on Tuesday with double-digit loan and deposit growth, strong hiring throughout its businesses and substantial fee growth.

Pinnacle is a small $4.5 billion Tennessee based commercial bank that has grown quickly using the strategy of recruiting top bankers from the larger regional banks and bringing in their teams and clients. That strategy has allowed Pinnacle to grow rapidly and profitably since bankers only bring over their best customers.  The company has doubled revenues over the past three years and strong Q3 growth shows the strategy is still working. The stock is up 3.5% since the report but, with a trailing PE of just 11.7, the market seems to be overlooking the growth and categorizing Pinnacle along with much less interesting bank stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Biopharmaceutical** 

**Dermira** jumped 26% on Friday after the company published positive results from a mid-stage clinical trial for its new eczema treatment, lebrikizumab.  44% of patients treated with lebrikizumab exhibited 90% skin clearance. Thats similar to recently launched eczema treatment Dupixent. However, unlike Dupixent, lebrikizumab also proved to be effective at reducing chronic itching (pruritus) which is often a significant issue for eczema sufferers.  It also had less of an impact on the immune system.

Dermira’s market cap was $390 million after Fridays rise.  However the stock could go a lot higher. There are nearly 7 million eczema sufferers in the US with currently untreatable conditions and the total addressable market for Dermira is estimated at $5 billion. Given its commercial advantages, regarding pruritus, Dermira should take a significant share of this if it can successfully transition from Phase 3 trials to FDA approval.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value Stocks**

**United Rentals** reported Q3 results on Wednesday with revenues up 17.6% and earnings up 17.4%.  Guidance was updated with revenues still expected to grow 6% for the year and the CEO said customers remain upbeat about their business prospects.  The market was not impressed, United Rentals after all has a large exposure to the construction industry and, as we near the end of the current up cycle, that is a concern.  

However United Rentals is much more than just a cyclical play. Growth is being driven by the benefits operators enjoy by renting machinery rather than owning machinery.  Renting allows customers to get the best and latest equipment, more flexibility, no storage costs and no debt. There is also still plenty of growth potential. United Rentals is the market leader but its market share is only 15%.  With crumbling US infrastructure and chronic housing shortages, it should expect to expand for many years to come. Current valuation with a trailing PE of 8.9 looks cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Large Caps (Netflix and Johnson &amp; Johnson)**

**Netflix** Q3 results on Wednesday were initially well received even though most of the 40% earnings surprise was accounted for by a once off non-cash item.  After adjusting for this, the core results still showed a very healthy 31% increase in revenues and 22.5% increase in earnings.

However concerns about the imminent rise in (lower priced) competition from new streaming services to be provided by Disney+ and Apple TV+ hit home later on Thursday and Friday and the stock ended the week down 3.5%.  The focus has clearly switched to the reduced guidance for Q4 subscriber growth which now looks vulnerable and the valuation, at 88x trailing earnings and 7x trailing revenues, still looks very expensive.

**Johnson &amp; Johnson** reported a Q3 beat and raise on Tuesday but any positivity unravelled on Friday when it was revealed that the company had recalled 33,000 bottles of baby powder after U.S. health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos. J&amp;J is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results, but it is nevertheless a set back for the company which has made repeated assurances regarding the products safety.  

Reputational issues aside, it could also prove very costly for the company. J&amp;J is fighting more than 14,000 lawsuits alleging its baby powder and talc products cause cancer. Last year, a St. Louis jury ruled that the company should pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who claimed the baby powder gave them ovarian cancer. The stock closed down 6.2% on Friday with a market capitalization of $337.0 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Acquisition**

Unnamed sources at Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management had made a $40 offer for **Hilton Grand Vacations**, the timeshare resort operator, and that the Blackstone Group had also made an offer.  A bidding war could prove very profitable for investors, and the stock did jump about 5%, but at $34.34 it still remains well below the price quoted by “unnamed” sources. At that price, either the stock is offering us a great opportunity to buy or alternatively the story is a load of garbage.  I wish I knew which was true.

When you are investing or trading you are using your money. But you are coming into a group/community and asking strangers what you should be doing with your money. Now I want you to think about that again. You are asking strangers what to do with your money....

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the questions I have read in many communities and sites.

Should I buy this/that stock Answer: No, you don't know what you are doing.

I bought xxx stock last week now it is going down! What should I do? Close it, you don't know what you are doing! You don't have an exit strategy or any risk management.

Is xxx going to go up? I bought it earlier. If you don't know which direction the stock is likely to go in, why did you buy it? Again you really need to think about why you are buying a stock/option etc before you hit that little buy button. 

Is this a good buy right now? What do the fundamentals tell you? What does the technical analysis tell you? If you don't know then no it is not a good buy right now.

Hi, I have 5k 10k 50k 100k to invest/trade what should I invest in? OMG NO Just no no no, nothing don't invest in anything! 

&amp;#x200B;

I learned to drive before I went on the motorway. I learned to swim before I jumped off the diving board into the pool. 

And if you didn't congratulations for being here today. But if you don't learn how to trade/invest then your money won't be here for very long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Step one: Read books and watch videos and learn about what you want to trade/invest in.

Step two: Open a practice account/paper trading account.

Step three: Be profitable on said practice account for at least two straight months.

Step four: Open a real money account with a small amount (under 2k) before you use your main money.

Step five: Be profitable on that small account for at least two straight months.

Finally if you don't have the patience to do these steps then maybe the markets aren't for you.

I'm not invested yet (been saving and wanted to learn first). The current approach I've got to analyze a stock is basically:

1. Categorize the stock to know what to look for (dividends play; high growth opportunity, turnaround...) and get some basic metrics (Momentum, PE, ROIC, Margins, financial ratios...).
2. Analyze the industry and the firm's evolution searching for moats and the company position. I really like Greenwald's explanation of moats.
3. Dig into financial reports to check what's the dividends history, hidden assets it may have, check if earnings have been overstated, etc.
4. Valuation: following Damodaran's models.

However, I find this to be such a long, confusing and draining process. I enjoy it but I become frustrated at times. I know when things are not easy you are more likely to get rewarded if you do your due diligence, but **I'm wondering if there's something I'm doing wrong or if I'm wasting my time with some steps**. These are the 2 main problems I encounter:

\- **Business Analysis**: **It takes me so much time to get a good grasp of some businesses and, after all the research, sometimes I feel like I don't know enough about it**. Take **IBM** for example: I know they offer cloud solutions, sell mainframes and provide AI services via its Watson platform. I know their focus is on hybrid cloud (hence the Red Hat acquisition), but I do not know how hybrid cloud will fare against Amazon and Microsoft's public clouds. I know the  theorical benefits of private vs public clouds but I can't forecast how the business will unfold and how many businesses will choose one type or the other. 

I read the cloud is supposed to use economies of scale, but I also know that when markets grow rapidly economies of scale start to lose steam. I read the cloud is supposed to have switching costs but IBM's compatible containers seem to reduce these costs. Is Amazon and Microsoft profitability sustainable then? It's even harder for the AI segment because it's a very complex technology and it's a bet in the medium/long term, where everything could change. **Do I just follow Warren Buffet's advice and do not invest in companies I can't understand?**

\- **Financial reports**: How much do you dig into it? Do you take the financial reports at face value or do you research about inventory changes, revenue recognition, etc.? **How much time does it take you?** Also, how do I check whether some metrics are favorable? I know that, as a general rule, a Current Ratio &gt; 1 is a good liquidity liquidity, but what about, say, interest coverage? I haven't found a ""magical"" number. Do I have to compare it to the industry? What if the industry as a whole is overleveraged and then comparisons don't make sense?

I've been trading the Canadian Cannabis market for \~3 years now and have done quite well, but sold all my previous holdings (long) at the peak. Held cash for a few months while analyzing my next buy, which was LABS (majority).

The last year of trading was all about volume, press releases, and multiples - sadly the wild west is over now (hope you were able to take advantage of that term) and the market is now looking for real Revs on the balance sheets. This is why I wanted to get opinions on LABS. They cleared $31MM in Rev last ER and their next ER is coming Nov 12, 2019.

They are one of the first companies I've noticed that have a solid business model and their timing in the market is impeccable - re: Oct 17 Edible market release - coming into the 'Cannabis 2.0' market with a line of products/services that the large LP's don't have internal access to, so said LP's are giving large quantities to LABS for tolling.

The kicker: Health Canada has seen a significant influx of Hemp Cultivation License applications this season - as long as you have land and no criminal record you can easily get approved - but most were given too late in the season for farmers to plant hemp, thus the 2020 season will have an oversupply of hemp (driving prices down of the raw commodity). This is where I see LABS taking off, specifically within the CBD product category that is seemingly very popular with consumers globally.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

Guidance was updated, largely unchanged, with revenues still expected to grow 6% for the year.  The CEO made positive comments about the outlook saying that customers remain upbeat about their business prospects well into next year. 

The market response was understated with a 5% increase and a trailing PE of 8.8. That’s because United Rentals has a large exposure to the construction industry and, as we near the end of the current up cycle, that is a concern.  However United Rentals is much more than just a cyclical play.

Firstly, growth is being driven by the benefits of operators renting machinery rather than owning machinery that has been driving growth for a couple of decades.  Customers get the best and latest equipment, more flexibility, no storage costs and no debt.

Secondly United Rentals is the market leader allowing it to better service large clients and enjoy economies of scale.  Through inventory management United Rentals can move machinery nationally to where it generates the best return and spread fixed central costs across a wider business.

Thirdly, even though United Rentals is the market leader with twice the market share (15%) of its nearest competitor, it still has significant room for growth.

Finally, United Rentals has excellent management who have guided the company with expertise for years.  Now, as we approach the end of the cycle, they have announced sound plans to aggressively use cash flow to pay down debt.  In fact they have already reduced net leverage from 3.1x In December 2018 to 2.7x today and expect it to fall to 2.6x by the end of the year.

I don’t know when the next cyclical downturn is coming but in my opinion it is an opportunity for United Rentals to take another big chunk of market share (organically and through cheap acquisitions) in order to benefit from the long term trends diving this industry.

The trailing PE of 8.8 looks cheap.

I'm looking for a small cap that has the potential to be a multi bagger. Stratasys has a 2 billion market cap and contracts with Ford and Boeing. I read somewhere that they are going to be selling more 3d printers to boeing next year.

It is the #4 holding in the Ark Innovators fund with a 6% weighting.

It is near a 52 week low so it might be a good time to start accumulating shares.

It seems like 3d printing will become a bigger part of manufacturing in the future.

Its based on my experience and knowledge, I gained throughout the years. Iam by far no professional. Iam just a guy who loves to invest. If you are new and have few grands to invest this article might help you.

My motivation to write this article was because when I turned 20 I got a small loan of 1 milli.... just few grands from my parents plus the savings I made from working. For me it was clear that I want to invest them. I always liked the idea making money and not really working for it! (Spoiler its kinda true and kinda not)

So I sum up few steps which will helped me to orientate and maybe help you to make your first investement

Step one 1. Where I can Invest?! You can basicly invest in everything. They are infinite options but I just cover up few topics.

They are 5 investments I would like to adress.

1. Stocks.
2. Real estate
3. Options
4. Start-ups
5. Krypton+1. art, old cars, drugs?! (Don’t do or sell drugs pls!)

Stocks (my fav.)I love stocks. I love understanding what the company’s plans are and where they are heading.

They are 3 different types of investment strategies.

1. Short term (daily)That’s usually daily trading. That means you invest and sell on a daily basis. If your not a expert it can frustrating and the chances that you will lose is high. Many people forget that you have to pay taxes and fees so even if you for example invest 1.000 and sell for 1.050 within 20 min. You will have to pay some fees and taxes and with luck, you are where you started. It only makes sense when you invest a lot, otherwise it makes no sense and to be honest I don’t know any person which makes profit with it.

Difficulty: Hard

Stress Lvl: High

Risk: Medium/High

Profit: Usualy bad

Investement: Medium

2. Mid term (6month – 1 year+)You buy some stocks for a longer period of time and hope it will go up soon.

This investment is much easier and less risky than short term. You see a stock going up and up so you invest 5k and hope you can ride a little on this upwards trend. Its fairly easy but you have to keep an eye on the market. A good example is VW it dropped because it has some Image problems. Thats a chance to invest! It will most likely to recover because its the biggest automarker in the world and it did. It happend 1000 times and normaly big companies dont fail they are exception but without risk you dont get anywhere

Difficulty: Medium

Stress: Medium

Risk: Medium

Profit: Good

Investment: Low

3. Long term ( 1-2years – 10 years+)Means you want to invest for a long time you are not only interested in making a quick buck but making a slow and steady progress. You are not interested if the stock goes up or down but you are more interested how much divendend they pay. Usualy they go up very slowly but steady. A good example for this type of stock is Royal Dutch (shell) it has ist up and downs but compared to other stocks ist stable. The dividend is 6% which is insanly good no other big company will pay you that every year. You invest 10.000€ and get every year 600€ which means a holiday for free. Also the work is very little, you only have to check the stocks every few weeks/month  You wont get rich but its better than having it in the bank.

Difficulty: Easy

Stress: Low

Risk: Low

Profit: Low

Investment: Low-Medium

Before you invest check the company read the news and get a good overview. I have to admit Iam a fanboy at heart. When a stock of one of my fav. company’s has potential and it does make sense to invest it feels like buying tickets for my favorite Rockband. You support and cheer them on and if they grow you grow with them. BUUUUUUT don’t get my wrong never buy stocks just because you like the company or they have a cool name.

All in all Stocks are a great Investment!

Real Estate

If you want to invest in houses it’s a very save and profitable investment but it depends on your area and country you are coming from. In Germany most objects are overpriced right now so it wouldnt make any sense to buy some. In generell the more money you have the better. They will will be much more people who can afford an cheap flat/condo than the other way around. So expensive objects are better! The optimum is always a shitty apartment in a very good area. Also buying objects in bad areas cause lots of trouble with tenant. Crazy families who refuse to pay, messy people etc. this can end in a stressful situation so beware of that.

If you are already rich af than buy propreties

Example

I went once to an auction and most apartments are sold for double the estimated value. It would take ages (20+ years) to get your investment back. So beware of your market situation.

Difficulty: Easy

Stress: Usualy low/medium

Risk: Low

Profit: Medium

Investment: High

Options

Options are basicly betting that a stock with go up or down. You can bet on nearly everything. You can make lot of money very quick and lose everything even quicker. For me option trading is gambling with few extra steps. The difference is you can lose more than you invest. They are cases where people invest 1000€ and lose -120.000€ because suddelny the market changed.

If you have gambling problems and tendency to gamble this is absolutly not for you. You can see here (in the forum) lots of bad examples where people going full YOLO on something and lose a ton of money. They save up a little, invest in something even more risky and lose again.

I know a friend who makes good money from it but he has a clear head and read many books about this topic he uses software to analyse the situation and everything and he admits that sometimes he doesnt understand what happend. Of course options are not the devils tool but I like to be the voice against it. The truth is in the middle.

Iam a person who likes to understand what am I doing. After reading and learning about it, for more than a year I was more confused than before. It is probably because Iam to stupid for it, so I gave it up and moved on. Options are not for me

Difficulty: very hard (at least for me)

Stress: high

Risk: low - very risky

Profit: It can be everything

Investment: low

4. Start-ups

Start-ups are also a great business opportunity. I was lucky enough to invest once a little bit into a upcoming company from my firend. He showed me his company and the plans for the future. I already helped him with few shows and stuff so I knew how everything worked.

The biggest bullshit I ever saw are the analyse prediction of the future sales. During the last few years I saw few of them and they all predicted that the company will make an absurd amount of money. It looked like high cool project all shiny and with big numbers. To be honest I dont even know who pay these people to make such bullshit predictions, seriously.

(as you can see I love talking from my life so forgive me my dear)

Long story short I still invested because I understood their model. They existed and already made great progress. I made 50% profit in 3 years. I am still very happy and greatful to had such good chance to invest and would do it again.

They biggest question is how do I find such chances ?

Tell people you are intersted to invest maybe a friend of you will start an company and you can invest or help you to find such a opprtunity. I went to many start up meetings and talk about a lot with my friends. They dont want to hear it but I tell them anyway and if there is a chance they will call me.

Few Tipps:

\- Look for already existing companys

\- Most companys give you a very good inside look before you invest! If not watch out they hide  something.

\- Try to understand what they are doing and where they are heading

\- Look what the will offer you for your money!

Difficulty: Medium/hard

Stress: Medium/low

Risk: Medium/High

Profit: Good/Very good

Investment: From Low to high

5. Krypto

Boy oh boy where to start. I heard to many experts saying yeah krypto thats future boyyyyyy I invested everything BOYYYYYYY and in few month I will be rich BOIIIIII.  I heard this story so often that Iam allgeric to it now. This irregulated mess based purly on speculations wasnt anything form me. I didnt invest a cent into it and had lots of chances when bitcoin was 300-500 €. It didnt simply fit into my portfolio. It had no function for me. You could pay for your drugs in the deep web and some hipster pizzerias accepted it but in generell it had no function. So investing into kryptos is just speclutions it has no real fundation what I like.

My friends who invested early made a ton of money but all the people on the Hypetrain crashed.

Difficulty: I dont know

Stress: Depends how much storys you make about it on Instagra´m

Risk: Over 9000

Profit: It can be everything from super high to low in just few days

Investment: What ever you want, if this is still to expensive for you, make your own coin and hope some Idiot buys it!

Now you know my knowledge ehh more like my opionen on few things now its time for…….Step. 2. Get a rough overview

Back than I didn’t know where to start so I asked everybody for advice like parents, friends , my parents friends, banks, forums, news etc. and got very different results.

Friends and family can be a good source of information how they did it. Of course often investments are impossible to repeat because they are 20 years ago but they can give some good advice. Its nice to hear few cool stories.

Example

Royal Dutch shell hast wo different stocks. One based in england (B) one Dutch version (A) (explained very simple, not 100% accurate). If you purchase Royal Dutch (A) you have to pay a 15% withholding tax that you wouldnt when you buy Royal Dutch (B).

Banks

Banks are terrible to ask. I always had shitty experience. The lured me into meetings, only to sell some shitty investment models from which they make some good money of me or some stupid insurence. They are not interested in your loses or profits they are interested to sell you the next stupid investement from which the make money. They never keep their promises and if you loose they will cheer you up and show their new hot investement and so on and so on until you loose and they drop you.

My mom works kind of in the finance sector and you wont believe home money older people lost ton of money because of this. I also found few very shady investements opportunities who would be illegal but I wont get into detail cause I dont have 100% proof  for it and I also dont want to get in any trouble. As you can see Iam not big fan oft them and do not recommend!

News/charts/indexes/Forums

For me charts &amp; news works the best. It’s easily so see what’s going on and gives you a great overview. The chart showed that a stock dropped 5%?! Good! Read the news/forums and find out what is going on! It’s that easy you don’t need 15 monitors and crazy software to understand what is happening. Dont make it to complicated! Have an easy overview about the market which you would like to invest.

Example

My parents invested around a year ago alot in Tesla. It was before Model 3 was released. Tesla had no expierence in mass production and it was clear (at least to me) that they wont have an easy start. They still made no profit and it was the first step to play with the big boys. Back than the Tesla stock was way over 300€ and it was based a lot on speculation and hype. It couldnt live up to they hype and dropped ≈ 30% - 35%.

3. Few points &amp; strategies

No Emotions

Never ever let your emotions guide you. Stocks are not based on a stomach feeling or any other emotion. Dont invest just because you like Elon Musk or Apple or anything. If I have a the chance to invest into one because the timing is right. Always make sure you know what you are doing. When it can wait a day, sleep a night about it and be sober! You can get sucked up into this world you will start giving a shit if you lose one grand and start digging deeper and deeper and lose sense the value of it. Stay sober and now when you have to stop.

Making losses

It will happend and dont freak out !

They are two options how to handle it and it depends on few things.

1. Sell them, you see the ship is sinking and their no possibility you can save it than sell it, It hurts but better early than it is to late. Or you find a better possibility to invest for example a start up than its also fine.
2. Keep it! Turning a Short/Mid-term investement into a long-term investement. Check first if the company will recover from it. For example the VW stocks dropped a lot due it scandal few years ago but it was clear that they will not go bankrupt so after a while they recover from it. Technically the market will grow infinite so after every crash they reach new heights, if you can wait that long the chances are high that you will make some profit and do not lose any money. Maybe the profit will be small but better than losing everything.

Diversity

Dont put all your eggs in one basket but also dont but every egg in a different basket. Have a good mix that you can still have an overview about your investment. Dont depend on one investment something bad can always happend. Having a good mix is important some investments will go up and few will go down. Its rearly that everything will crash (expect crises). So you can sell the good one and keep the bad ones until they go up.

Scams

Online

Stick to the basics! They are a ton of scammers online who want to show you a way to make fast money. Its mostly some MLM (multi level markting) aka Pryamide sheme, some buying and reselling some stuff from China or some weird option trading platform where pay in and your money is gone in 5 min without any trace o fit (no chance getting it back)! The Instagram advertisment is so ridiculous and I feel stupid mentioning it but hey if it wouldnt work they wouldnt exist. So please dont be this guy….

Offline

I really wanted to invest and have an own start-up. I met many people and visited countless seminars. Few of them offered me to invest but it was a mostly a mess. Onced I got fooled. A friend and I meet a person who had a start up for social media. We had some meetings restaurant he paid everything for us and looked very legit. I worked 3-4 month in this start up 3-4 hours a day, even on weekends for free. Only later to find out I was the only one working in it. (My friend pulled out very early cause he wanted to focus on his PhD) They rest oft he Team did absolute nothing! All the money the company generated was based on my work. They didnt make a lot of money but around 600-800€ a month. The founder spend all the money on vacation and stuff. I never got anything. They wanted to sell me 10% of the company for 15.000€. I always said I need more inside infos, which of course I never got. So I pulled out and they went mad and threaten me to sue me. I feel to this day ashamed that I trusted them and didnt saw it.

If you want get into something like this make a contract dont rely on handshakes people will tell you everything and wont keep it. I learned it the hard way

Be open minded

I met enough people who dont want to share with me their portfolio because they are scared that I will steal something from them. Its stupid! Talk to as many people als possible about your investment. Some amazing things can happend. I meet to many great people because of that and with some I share a 5+ years long friendship maybe we dont share the same ideas but I leanred a lot of it and sometimes I made some profit because of it! Be open !

Prediction &amp; graphic lines

When I did my first Investment (it was gold) I read every morning every article about it I could  for at least a solid year. Every monring 20 min Thats rouhly 120 hours. Thats time I will never get back. It was wasted time. The news/articels predicted everything. It was a rollercoaster. I believed it in the beginning because it was new to me. It really messed me up and I spend way to much time overthinking. Its fine to see a prediction but the more extreme it is the more it will never happend.

Also the trendlines are mostly worthless. I read so many people talking about the 50 day trendline or the 200 day trendline. It only idicates if a stock goes up or down but people interepte everything into it. “Oh yeah you can see the restience at 12.50 if it will drop below everbody will sell“. The next day it dropped and nothing happend. Dont believe everything in the internet. (lol)

Keep it simple

Dont make it to complicated you can have the best infos and charts and everything in the world and still lose everything. So dont make it to hard for yourself.

THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE

No depts

Dont take a credit just because you know a great investment. No matter how much you could earn DO NOT TAKE A CREDIT. This can not only ruin you financily but also your family and your whole life. This is no joke! Make no depts.

DO NOT MAKE FUCKING DEBTS!

My Strategy

It is a mixture of long term and mid-term stock investments. Its very easy I invested in:

Before I buy some

\- Royal Dutch because of the high dividend

\- Deutsche Bank when the hit nearly a all time low hoping to recover (still hoping ☹ )

\- Lufthansa because they bought few airlines and hopefully will grow but its not (thanks Greta !)

\- Tesla because they are low and made some good deals for the future.

Am I rich or making a lot of money?! Hell no! But Iam making enough to pay for my holidays and few extras. I am patient enough to sit out bad times. I never sold anything with loose and I want to keep it that way. I like having a clean record.

I am a dividend growth investor, and I wanted to offer my perspective on dividend growth stocks and dividend (growth) investing as a strategy. 

I know many of you will have seen contrasting videos from Ben Felix and PPCIan on youtube on this topic. My purpose for posting is that I want to spark a broad discussion of the strategy and on dividends in general. 

In my view, it’s a truly incredible strategy. 

For some context, I began trading awhile back, just about breaking even overall. When I started to invest in blue chip dividends stocks geared towards strong free cash flow and dividend growth, I started to see some growth in my portfolio, and that growth will continue whether the market dips or rises. 
 
If the market rises, obviously share price will increase and I’m still collecting dividends. With DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan), I gain fractional shares and eventually full shares of the companies I own. By investing for ownership of the company (very long term) your wealth will snowball over time. 

If the market falls, you’ll appear to lose money on the share price, but it’s actually a blessing in disguise. When the market falls, most blue chip stocks go on sale and trade at more favorable valuations. Additionally, since the market price is cheaper, you’ll accumulate shares quicker using dividend reinvestment. It’s automated dollar cost averaging. When the market becomes more bullish, the value of your shares will increase rapidly on top of the dividend income you’re receiving steadily. 

The only situation where you’re selling is when a company you own cuts it’s dividend or eliminates it entirely. If you keep holding for decades, your wealth will compound at a rapid rate. The more time you are invested, the more wealth you will create. 

By investing in companies with strong balance sheets, free cash flow and dividend growth, you can create enormous wealth. By doing solid dd and fundamental analysis, you’ll be investing in great companies at favorable valuations. Additionally, dividend increases signal that management is confident in the business and confident that they’ll be able to maintain a higher payout. 

Some things you should avoid are companies with yield traps (companies with high dividend yields to keep investors roped in), companies with high payout ratios (I personally like to avoid companies with over 75% payout ratio) and companies that take on a lot of debt (hurts free cash flow). 

The best part is that you never have to sell the shares that you own. You can live off your dividends in retirement AND pass ownership onto your kids. 

The passive income generated by dividends is life changing. The process requires discipline and it’s not sexy — time matters and it’s a key component.

If you’re interested in learning more about this strategy, please head over to r/dividends or r/dividend_investing to learn more and check out PPCIan on YouTube. I’m also happy to answer questions if you pm me.

* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell

Just last night I was attempting to understand my first 10-K report from UNH. (coincidentally, I didn’t realize their next earnings report came out today [10/15]) I was also glossing over their 2nd quarter report (8-K?), but tbh I have no clue what to look for.

Today I’m driving and hear on Bloomberg that ‘earnings season is here, and UNH, JPM, and JNJ all jumped due to higher than expected earnings.

I have several questions;

1) What is ‘earning season’, is it just the period of time shortly after a quarter has ended, where we can expect a report on the previous earnings from a company?

And

2) What metrics should I be looking at in 8-Ks? EPS compared to last quarter? Any crazy changes in debts and acquisitions? Free-cash flow? What else?

I’d like to share a stock picking game I created. 

I was in many traders groups and I benefited from watching what the traders do. I think that helped me learn more about the stock market over time. 

But then I realized if there’s a game for traders to share and discuss their opinions about stocks, then collectively people can benefit from it and maybe discover great companies in the long run. 

What I see is a lot of people are talking about Apple, Square or Shopify back when the price is still low. So I think if you can spend a little more time talking to other traders about those companies and deep dive into the financials then you might have a better chance of finding the next big things happening. 

So that’s why I created this website. I hope it’s useful or fun for people who want to learn more about investing in stocks and gain some insights. Also, some suggestions would be nice.

The FTRC, developed by NASA, measures the amount of heat energy released during thermal runaway, a dangerous, powerful chain-reaction explosion that can happen when batteries are stored, shipped or used together. The technology helps engineers and designers understand these incidents and develop solutions to mitigate them. The one year FTRC licensing agreement allows KULR to evaluate the FTRC’s commercial applicability and further enhance the Company’s position as the leading end-to-end battery safety design, testing, shipping, storage and failure-mitigation provider.

In addition to the FTRC, the Company also licenses the [**Internal Short Circuit**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TUElLyo_E-GaSxGD3UipMPToWodU8sm7wvrI85eNIYK2nV3CRvp7CF5emoSD_KckvZL1ZPaVsuaLF0y8UM07h1j5PLIzovuk1wVdp3_zX0ucsos6Unz5VktEOIJiPPVeBRG7aVtKmqLTnKtB3X81Pg==) (ISC) from NASA.

Ongoing research, teaching and development of lithium-ion batteries are essential for public and commercial safety because lithium-ion batteries are the industry and consumer standard for portable power – billions of individual battery cells exist and billions more are planned for production. They power everything from smart phones and laptops to electric cars and space crafts but when they fail, the results can be catastrophic. By determining the fraction of energy dissipated via a triggered internal short circuit, the FTRC provides the data needed to implement optimizations to a given battery design while also maintaining safety margin requirements.

“Lithium-ion batteries are not going away and with companies continuing to pour billions into making them, it’s vital that we keep working on ways to make these batteries safer to manufacture, store, ship and ultimately use,” said Dr. Timothy Knowles, CTO of KULR. “Continuing our great relationship with NASA on battery safety by licensing the FTRC is just another way we can help make batteries more reliable and safer for everyone, whether they’re in space, in an electric car, or powering a laptop or a cell phone,” he said.

2- $2,000 can turn into almost $100,000 after 40 years (at 10% return a year).
3- Investing in stocks can help you pay for your biggest goals.

That 10% average increase may not sound like much, but given time, this interest compounds to produce incredible returns. 

Imagine someone told you that you could turn $2,000 into $100,000 with no work whatsoever? It sounds too good to be true, but it’s completely possible if you understand compound interest (which will be discussed in the next lesson). 

The key element to remember here is time. The longer you have your money invested, the more powerful compounding becomes. That means the younger you get started, and the more patient you are, the greater returns you will reap in the future. 

However, you don’t need $2,000 to get started. You can start small and keep adding to your investment over time. You’ll be amazed how quickly your investment can grow. In fact, if you added $100 a month to that initial $2,000 investment, after 40 years you’d have close to $1 million.

You’ll have both winners and losers, but if you learn how to identify good companies, you’ll have some stocks that multiply 10 times (or more) in value over the years.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

i have this question that's bumping in my mind and I would like to gather some opinions about that.

One of my investments goals is to Hold a position on the S&amp;P500 ETF for 30/40 years because I inherited a considerable amount of money and I want to allocated in something I know it will grow over time. Instead of picking individual stocks or creating a portfolio with stocks, bonds and commodities, since I am holding that ETF for 30/40 years, I don't see any advantage in diversify this investment more in bonds and commodities. According to the history of the S&amp;P 500 and the stock market in general, even with the recessions the value from 30-40 years from now will be higher from the year that i am investing now, which is 2019. S&amp;P500 have an CAGR of 10% during the last 47 years, so i really think this ETF will have, at least, an CAGR between 5-10% for the next 30-40 years. My question is, if you have a considerable amount of money to invest and didn't have to worry for at least 30 years, what would you do? The only issue I'v come up with is the price of the S&amp;P500 ETF. I prefer waiting for a recession to buy in dips and have a bigger CAGR.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,419617,public,self,Investing in SP500 ETF,0,1572075707,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/di4bli/investing_in_sp500_etf/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

•  Invested funds are working for you 24/7.
•  Invested money can grow much faster than cash in a savings account.

Ever wanted to own part of a great business? That’s exactly what happens when you purchase stock. You’re buying a part of that company. As a part owner, you’re entitled to a share of the profits and assets of that business. 

You profit from owning stock in one of two ways. 

1. The company can decide to return money to their shareholders via dividends. This is cash that is paid to you on a regular basis for being a shareholder. 

2. The business grows and the price per share increases. Once you decide to sell your shares, you pocket the returns. 

While money kept in a savings account gets eaten away by inflation, invested money is working for you 24/7. Unlike a bank account, your original outlay can multiply many times over if you invest in the right companies. 

On average, the stock market has returned around 10% annually since 1974 (without factoring in inflation).

I looked into it and it seems ridiculously cheap(P/E of 3), but not the kind of wonderfull business Buffett would own, it´s more like a Graham cigar butt stock.

Details:

I'm pretty sure I owned 100 shares of Honeywell (HON) as of mid-1990 (I know I owned the stocks, just not sure about the amount).  But the earliest record in my Fidelity account online shows a transaction of 175 shares coming into the account in January of 1993.  All dividends have been reinvested (and I can see those numbers) so it should be a straight forward method to determine what I should be at or where I actually started.  But it's not.

When I calculate the shares using the splits that occurred (see screenshot), I think I should have 419.5 shares, not including any dividend reinvestment, if I started with 100 shares in 1990.  But Fidelity shows me acquiring 192 shares over that 23 years since 1993 from dividend reinvestment, which adds to the 175 shares from 1993 for a total of 367 shares, and that is currently what's in my portfolio.  But those numbers don't seem to take into account any of the splits and that is where I'm confused.

Should nasdaq have a level 2 subscription. Can footprint charts be built for stocks and if not - why not?

Doesn't programs like market delta, sierra chart numbers allow for the footprint on stocks?",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,419157,public,self,Are footprint charts available for stocks?,0,1572055346,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dhjyl7/are_footprint_charts_available_for_stocks/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

It is the weekend heading into the third month of October. S&amp;P500 has rallied strongly in the final  days of the week upon optimism over fundamentals. At one point, we'd made record weekly gains for the year, but price dropped in the last hour of trading to close 2969 down from a high of 2992.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately part four was wasted with having to [post brokerage statements](https://www.reddit.com/user/whatthefx/comments/de3krz/2020_foresight_2020_foresight_what_to_do_to/), which is not a very productive. Hopefully it stops people who do not have experience using these forms of analysis saying I am lying - there is no longer time for debating empty points that do not respect the model of hypothesis, evidence and probability.  If the markets are going to crash in the coming year, things are going to start happening very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Critical Warning Sign: S&amp;P500 opens and starts to drop, the speed of the drop picks up through the week. The low is made around 2650, but there is not a lot of upwards movement.**

&amp;#x200B;

In part three, I said our early warning signal was a 10% drop in week two of October. However, the precursor move of markets moving up and down and closing on 2960 area did not happen in week one.

[https://imgur.com/a/albJVX2](https://imgur.com/a/albJVX2)

&amp;#x200B;

This criteria failing to meet meant the larger move was less likely to happen, and updates on this [were posted going into week two.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingAlerts/comments/ddgy10/preliminary_sp500_trade_plan_for_2nd_week_of/)

&amp;#x200B;

The move we had last week does fit with the precursor move we'd usually see foreshadowing a big move like this. The action last week tells us we are getting extremely close to the decision point whether the markets go higher or lower, and if they're going lower, they never do that slowly.  In the coming week we may see the failure of the bull trend, and price dropping several percent a  day with a sustain run of days doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

If we see this, 2600 becomes a vital level. This is the level where the daily trend would either continue or break.  A big warning sign we should look for that it may break is price stopping just before this level and making a couple bullish moves upwards (but not getting too high).  Usually when a strong trend continuation level will hold the market rushes into it. When the fast move starts, it stops there.

&amp;#x200B;

However, a  tendency we have when a market is going to break a strong level is for it to fake a reversal a little bit before that level. Then after a short period of  moving up and ranging it comes down hard and goes through the level. You can think of it like the seller taking a little break and getting ready to reload to take out the strong area. If we see this sort of action coming from around 2640 - 2660 we should be aware there can be a big move down coming.

&amp;#x200B;

The failure of 2600 will be an important one.  If it fails, we should see the market falling fast through it and hitting 2500 area.  If we see this, we should be aware that this  level has failed. This is where the big bulls would have come in if they were coming. If we crash through there, it's took big bears. The market will not instantly crash from this break, but it tells us it is setting up to.

&amp;#x200B;

If and when this happens,  there can be a bounce upwards. This bounce upward will probably end somewhere around the 2700 level. This is when it is likely to become very apparent there is strong sellers in the market. The move from 2700 can take us very quickly down to 2320.  After this, there will  be a series of shallow pull backs and pushes lower, and these will  lead up to fatal slice move [described in part 1](https://www.reddit.com/user/whatthefx/comments/cy1nj5/2020_foresight_what_to_do_to_protect_and_profit/).

&amp;#x200B;

The week ahead is the most dangerous one in the S&amp;P500 for 10 yeas.  If the bulls lose  in spectacular fashion next week, they've quit.  We will see bear markets. The only way we will not if this time happens to be different from every other time, ever. Which does not seem to be a smart way to bet.

&amp;#x200B;

I really do  want to  stress, the build up of different things we're seeing here **does not happen often.** You'd not be able to find the specific conditions we have currently outside of the penultimate part of previous bull runs.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,418804,public,self,2020 Foresight: How to Protect and Profit in a Bear Market (Part 5),0,1572036762,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dh1h4p/2020_foresight_how_to_protect_and_profit_in_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

# **Profits expected to fall as earnings season kicks off in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/11/profits-expected-to-fall-as-earnings-season-kicks-off-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The third-quarter earnings season kicks off in the coming week, and it is likely to expose how much the trade war has cost companies’ bottom lines.
*****
&gt; First out of the gate are major banks and financial companies, with J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs reporting Tuesday. But by the end of the week, a smattering of industrial, tech, transportation and consumer names will have reported, including Alcoa and Honeywell. Netflix and IBM report Wednesday, and consumer giant Coca-Cola reports Friday. United Airlines reports Tuesday, and CSX reports Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, some important economic reports are being released, including retail sales on Wednesday and industrial production Thursday.
*****
&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to decline by 3.1% for the third quarter, after growing by more than 3% in the second quarter, according to data from Refinitiv. For the second quarter, earnings were also expected to be negative to flat, but results beat lowered expectations.
*****
&gt; “The story of are we going to be negative, or are we not going to be negative, is going to be in focus,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
*****
&gt; Palfrey said margins are being pinched in several areas, including energy, with the decline in oil prices. Oil has been responding more to worries about global growth and trade wars than to geopolitical developments that normally could drive it higher. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 7.5% in the third quarter.
*****
&gt; “We are of the view that companies will likely devote a significant portion of their time talking about the impact of trade tariffs,” Palfrey said. “The goal is to ascertain just how much the decline in earnings is coming from those pressures.”
*****
&gt; The decline in oil prices, in fact, are expected to drag down profits in the energy sector. Earnings for the energy sector are expected to be down 32%, while revenues are expected to fall by 9.5%, according to Credit Suisse. Margins for the sector are expected to contract by 22.7%. Without energy estimates included, S&amp;P profits would be down just 1%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “We think margins are going to subtract 5.9% from EPS growth of the S&amp;P 500,” said Palfrey. He projects earnings overall to decline by 4.2%, and he does not expect the stock market to make much headway during the earnings season.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re moving sideways. The real backstop is the environment, while under pressure, it is nonrecessionary, and that will ultimately prevent the market from materially selling off,” said Palfrey.
*****
&gt; Palflrey said a group he calls “tech plus,” which include tech and communications companies, have taken some of the biggest margin hits this quarter even though revenue growth remains solid. Six of the top 10 companies whose margins impacted S&amp;P earnings growth the most are from that group, including Alphabet , Amazon, Apple, Facebook, IBM and Micron.
*****
&gt; As a group, their margins are expected to contract by 14.8%, compared with 3.6% for all other S&amp;P 500 companies combined.
*****
&gt; ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum are on the list of companies with the biggest margin hits. Exxon for example saw a decline in margins of 34%, and Credit Suisse estimates that pared 0.6% off overall S&amp;P 500 earnings growth. Credit Suisse says the consensus decline in Amazon margins is expected to be 42.5%, denting S&amp;P earnings growth by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; “At least for earnings, it’s a relatively positive backdrop. We should see a little bit of clarity on the whole China trade,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. Hickey said in the past two quarters, stocks did well at the start of the reporting season, but they were then derailed by trade developments in the latter part of the earnings period.
*****
&gt; Palfrey said the market is being held back by several factors, including the slowdown in the manufacturing sector. “I think it’s going to be difficult for the market to move meaningfully higher without an improvement in industrial data and without the yield curve becoming uninverted,” he said.
*****
&gt; ISM manufacturing data has been weakening and has shown a contraction in activity for the past two months.
*****
&gt; The inverted yield curve is a bond market recession warning. When the curve is inverted, shorter duration securities yield more than longer duration securities, meaning investors are demanding a higher yield to hold investments for a much briefer time. In this case, the 3-month Treasury bill was yielding about 11 more basis points than the 10-year note.
*****
&gt; Hickey said there could be some positives in the earnings season, like last quarter. Negative revisions of earnings estimates by analysts are outnumbering positive revisions by about 2 to 1. He noted in the last two quarters, stocks responded well to earnings news in the beginning of the reporting period but then faded when negative headlines on trade in the latter part of each earnings season.
*****
&gt; “Expectations seem pretty low. We’ve had analysts’ downward revisions remain elevated, as they’ve been heading into prior warning seasons. But we haven’t necessarily seen the number of warnings from companies rising,” he said. “It could be a positive divergence that analysts are lowering earnings estimates at a higher-than-average rate, but companies aren’t warning at a higher-than-average rate.”
*****
&gt; Financial companies profits are expected to be up by 1.4%, and real estate is expected to see the best profit growth with a gain of 2.7%, according to Refinitiv. The information technology sector is expected to see a profit decline of 7.6%, and communications is expected to be 1% lower, according to Refinitiv. Materials is expected to see the biggest decline after energy. Sensitive to global growth and manufacturing, the sector’s earnings are expected to fall 11.1%.
*****
&gt; Despite the downbeat expectations for third-quarter earnings, companies may issue more positive outlooks after China and the U.S. announced the first phase of a trade deal.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all up more than 1%. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were also up around 1% for the week and snapped a three-week losing streak.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 10/11/19

&gt; It was a disappointing week for US economic data as two-thirds of releases came in weaker than expected or than the prior period. Consumer Credit data for the month of August was the only major release on Monday, exceeding expectations, but declining from July’s level. Inflation data took the spotlight this week with the release of PPI, CPI, and export and import prices. Core CPI was inline with the previous month and the import price index’s decline (year over year) was smaller than forecasted, but other readings on inflation were weaker. Likewise, labor data had its share of disappointments as the JOLTS report showed a third consecutive decline in openings, hourly earnings growth slowed, and continuing claims ticked higher. Initial Jobless Claims provided some relief though, coming in at 210K compared to 220K expected and 219K last week. While small business optimism was weaker—NFIB’s index fell to 101.8 from 103.1—consumer sentiment readings from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan both rose with the latter exceeding expectations.

&gt; Looking ahead to next week, the calendar is slightly busier with 22 releases on the docket in addition to earnings beginning to ramp up as a total of 115 companies report. There are no scheduled economic releases Monday due to Columbus Day, so next week’s data begins on Tuesday with Empire Manufacturing which is forecasted to fall from 2.0 to 0.5. Other manufacturing gauges, including the Philadelphia Fed’s index and industrial production, are also expected to fall. Retail Sales is scheduled for Wednesday and are expected to rise 0.3%. On Thursday, Housing Starts and Permit data are both expected to show moderation. The leading index is scheduled to round out the week on Friday.

# Fund Flows Favor Fixed Income

&gt; This week’s fund flow numbers from the Investment Company Institute showed that the long, steady rotation from equity mutual funds and exchange traded funds to fixed income funds has continued.

&gt; As shown below, the spread between equity fund flows and fixed income fund flows has reached a net reading of -$165.9bn over the last three months; that’s among the largest net flow out of equities and into bonds since the data starts.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-Flows-1.png))**

&gt; Fixed income isn’t the only place that retail has been moving allocations to. As shown in the chart below, 13 week commodity fund flows have been among the largest of the periods since the data for ETF and mutual funds combined begins.

# The Most Volatile Stocks on Earnings

&gt; Looking for action? At the start of each earnings season, we publish our list of the most volatile stocks on earnings. Our Earnings Explorer tool contains a huge database that has every single quarterly earnings report for nearly all US-listed stocks going back to 2001. One part of the database tracks the one-day price reaction that stocks experience following their earnings reports, so users are able to easily track how individual stocks typically react to earnings.

&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks expected to report within the next month that have historically been the most volatile in reaction to earnings. To make the list, the company had to have at least 20 quarterly reports (5 years) and also have a current share price of $5 or more.

&gt; At the top of the list is Telecom equipment maker Infinera (INFN), which is scheduled to report on October 28th after the close. INFN just barely makes the cut because it trades at $5.20/share, but it has historically averaged a one-day absolute change of 15.16% on its historical earnings reaction days. You can expect a big move when it reports at the end of this month. Consumer review website YELP ranks as the second most volatile stock on earnings with an average one-day move of +/-14.85%. Enphase Energy (ENPH), LendingTree (TREE), and Applied Opto (AAOI) round out the top five with average one-day moves of more than +/-13% on their earnings reaction days. Other notables towards the top of the list include Wayfair (W), Netflix (NFLX), and Twitter (TWTR), which all typically move either up or down more than 12% on earnings.

&gt; Of the stocks on the list, Enphase (ENPH) is up by far the most in 2019 with a huge gain of 424%. Other stocks like Stamps.com (STMP), ANGI Homeservices (ANGI), and Green Dot (GDOT) are down more than 50% YTD. Twitter (TWTR), Blucora (BCOR), and Benefitfocus (BNFT) have the highest earnings beat rates at more than 90%. While it has a high beat rate, BNFT has been on a wild ride over the past two years, rallying from $24 up to $60 in 2018 before falling all the way back down to $24 as of today. You can bet a big move is in store when it reports on the 31st.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/allvol.png))**

&gt; If you're just interested in large-cap names, below is a list of the most volatile S&amp;P 500 stocks on earnings. These are stocks set to report over the next month, and as shown, Netflix (NFLX) is at the top of the list with an average one-day move of +/-12.78% on earnings. Twitter (TWTR), Align Tech (ALGN), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and Akamai (AKAM) rank 2nd through 5th in that order, while other notables include Amazon (AMZN), Advanced Micro (AMD), Chipotle (CMG), Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN).

&gt; If you own or have interest in owning any of these names, buckle up because they're likely to experience a big move when they report at some point in the next few weeks!

# Key Earnings Reports Over the Next Two Weeks

&gt; Our Earnings Calendar is part of our Earnings Explorer tool. The calendar shows the upcoming earnings report dates for US-listed companies over the next month, and investors use it as an easy way to monitor the names they're most interested in. We provide quite a bit of information for each company listed in the calendar, including EPS and sales estimates, its historical beat rates, and its average share price performance on its earnings reaction day. If you ever want to know how a stock typically trades in reaction to its earnings report, this is the place to go.

&gt; The Q3 2019 earnings reporting period finally kicks off next week when most of the big banks are set to report. But the biggest weeks for earnings will come in the back half of October and the first couple weeks of November. As shown in the chart below, the week of October 28th through November 1st is the busiest of them all when we'll see hundreds of companies report each day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/calen.png))**

&gt; Below is a list pulled from our Earnings Calendar of the key earnings reports to watch next week (based on market cap). There are no key reports to speak of on Monday the 14th due to Columbus Day, but on Tuesday we'll hear from Citigroup (C), Goldman (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) all before the open. On Wednesday, we'll get results from Bank of America (BAC) in the morning and then IBM and Netflix (NFLX) after the close, while on Thursday we'll hear from Morgan Stanley (MS), which will be the last of the major banks and brokers to report next week. American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO), and Schlumberger (SLB) will finish off the week with reports on Friday morning.

&gt; Of the key stocks reporting next week, Goldman (GS), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) beat EPS estimates the most often at more than 90% of the time. In terms of price reactions, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) -- which reports on Thursday afternoon -- has historically reacted the most positively to earnings with an average one-day gain of 3.24%. Bank of America (BAC) has the weakest price reaction to earnings with an average one-day drop of 0.95%.

&gt; In terms of earnings volatility, Netflix (NFLX) takes the cake with an average absolute one-day change of 12.78% on its earnings reaction day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/key-reports-next-week-use.png))**

&gt; The following week (10/21-10/25) is when we'll really be in the heart of the Q3 reporting period. A large number of Dow 30 stocks will report that week, including big blue chips like McDonald's (MCD), United Tech (UTX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT). The most important report of the week will come on Thursday the 24th when Amazon (AMZN) announces after the close. AMZN is currently expected to announce earnings of $7.19/share and revenues of $68.7 billion for the quarter. AMZN doesn't have an abnormally high EPS beat rate at just 62.5%, but it is typically a very volatile name as its average one-day move on earnings has historically been nearly +/-10%. Just think, a 10% move for AMZN is a $174 swing in either direction based on its current share price.

# Is October Really Scary?

&gt; Just like that, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell more than 1% on the first day of October. The rough start has many investors on edge, as October is known for spectacular crashes—specifically 1929, 1987, and 2008.

&gt; On the flipside, September 2019 was historically calm for equity markets, as the S&amp;P 500 didn’t fall 1% on a single day the entire month.

&gt; “The lack of any volatility in September could mean the usually volatile month of October could be due for some big swings,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news, though, is while October has had a bad rap for some big drops, over the past 20 years, it actually has been the third best month of the year for stocks.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, October has quietly been one of the strongest months of the year over the past 10 and 20 years. Going back to 1950, it ranks as the seventh strongest month of the year, so right near the middle of the pack.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/october-stocks_2019.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Four other things to consider:
Since 1950, no month has had more 1% moves (higher or lower) than October.
Since 1928, 6 of the 10 worst single-day drops have taken place in October; however, 3 of the 10 best days ever occurred in October as well.
This is a pre-election year, and as the chart above shows, October’s average returns in a pre-election year have been muted since 1950. The catch here is that this average return is greatly impacted by the 21.8% drop in 1987. The median return is actually quite respectable.
October has been higher during a pre-election year every year since 1999, with an average return of an impressive 6.5%.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

My 5 stocks choices with competitive advantages are:

1. Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE: UNP) -Their railroad networks dominate California to Chicago, all the way up to Canada then as far south as Mexico. Even with self driving technology, your self driving truck can't compete with a 200 long cargo train charging 100s of dollars a container. Rail is cheaper, fast, and eco friendly way of transport that reaches areas that may be inaccessible for trucks or not cost effective (Think transporting recycled steel).
2. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) -Manufacturing military gear such as aircraft is very lucrative especially when you have an unaccounted for USA military industrial complex spending. With potential conflicts in so many nations, what could go wrong buying this stock?
3. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) - Doctors are expensive sometimes costing upwards of 1 million a year to pay, insure, and other costs. All a robot needs is maintenance, a technician (almost always cheaper), electricity, hardware and software then you are good to go. Since healthcare is a fortune to pay for, and robots are typically significantly cheaper, developing automation is the smart thing to do.
4. Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) - The world isn't any closer to a trash less society, this is a simple business model perfect for mega companies. The moat around US trash collection is how regulations on local, state, and federal levels make it a very hard business to get into which costs usually millions just to have dominion over one area. Republic Services is in 41 states and although is 2nd place to Waste Management, offers more growth potential due to Waste Management already being top dog. In addition Republic Service can profit off of trash collection via recycling.
5. Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) -Being an artisan company usually making $10 off something that is likely less than $1 to make is a lucrative business. Especially when your brand is worth billions and associated with middle class and up clientele. Starbucks is like the Disney of coffee, they sell the romance of coffee shops with a well proven and established formula. Considering coffee is just as addictive as any other normal thing like soda, it's no surprise to recommend Starbucks stock. I doubt most Starbucks drinkers are going to go cold turkey anytime soon with coffee.

**SmileDirectClub** has fallen 30% since Monday despite every major analyst coming out with a buy rating or equivalent.  UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo described a $70 billion opportunity in the U.S. with a total addressable market of 40 million adults. Caliendo expects 15% penetration through 2023 to drive EBIT margins of around 17%. That works out at an EBIT of $1.8 billion and I would estimate a reasonable valuation (7x that) of $12.5 billion compared to a current market capitalization $3.9 billion.  JPMorgan highlighted an even greater $569 billion global revenue opportunity. 

The market’s reaction shows a healthy level of skepticism, given all the analysts participated in SmileDirectClub’s IPO last month, but nobody is denying that the opportunity described is reasonable. Fewer than 1% of individuals with misalignment of teeth are currently receiving treatment, and one big reason is the high cost of orthodontic treatment. SmileDirectClub offers an approach that greatly reduces those costs.

**Value Stocks (The Michaels Companies, Bed Bath and Beyond, Hanesbrands)**

On Monday the **Michaels Companies’** announced that UPS was to utilize 1,100 of its arts and craft stores as drop off and pick up points, iust in time for Halloween.  The company had previously seen its stock valuation drop significantly due to general uneasiness about retail and concerns about trade tariffs -- current TTM PE just 4.7x. That seems harsh given the company was able to put many of the tariff concerns and Q1's dismal performance behind it after it reported strong Q2 earnings last month with comps up 0.3% and EPS up 27%.

The UPS announcement should boost footfall in Michaels; stores nationwide and it is a good reason to cheer the stock price which is up significantly (90%) from its August lows. But its valuation, with a trailing PE of 4.7 and forward PE of 4.0, still looks cheap.

**Bed Bath and Beyond** soared 22% on Thursday to $12.09 after the company announced that it had poached Mark Tritton as CEO. Formerly the Chief Merchandising Officer at Target, Tritton had been in charge of all merchandising, product development, visual displays and private-label programs, making him instrumental in Target’s reinvention.

Patrick Gaston, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s chairman of the board, said that “Mark’s ability to re-define the retail experience and drive growth at some of the world’s most successful retailers and brands makes him uniquely equipped to lead Bed Bath &amp; Beyond”

I have felt that the stock is oversold for sometime even taking into account retail worries.  Even after yesterday’s jump, its market cap of $1.53 billion compares to a $0.75 billion operational cash flow and the balance sheet looks very healthy with net debt of just $0.5 billion.  Measures taken by the interim CEO, Mary Winston, to reduce the number of promotions and unprofitable stores already looked like they were about to start yielding higher margins and profits.  The appointment of Mr Tritton should help boost that further.

On Monday, Fool.com outlined a strong value thesis for **Hanesbrands Inc**.  The stock is cheap, trading for just 8.4 times next year's earnings estimates and offers a high dividend yield of 4.15%. Investors have been concerned by Chinese tariff concerns although a recent Credit Suisse report says that only 2% of the company's costs of goods sold are imported from China. 

However the main narrative is that the company’s best known brand, Champion, has moved on from being a bargain bucket item and it is now a major force in its own right as a result of 70’s nostalgia and a rising demand for loungewear.  A number of new Champion stores have opened in elite shopping districts featuring retro styles and, according to Bloomberg, teenage boys rank Champion in their top 15 favorite fashion brands alongside stalwarts such as Gucci and Tommy Hilfiger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Large Cap (Dominos)**

**Domino's Pizza Inc** had a volatile week. On Tuesday its stock fell 5% after reporting stronger competition, falling comps and a weaker outlook before rising and ending the day up 5% after the market realized that a buy back of 10% of outstanding stock was on the way.  The market has struggled to maintain those gains and I would agree, the main narrative of the print was stronger competition, falling comps and a weaker outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

**Emerging Markets (Azul SA)**

On Tuesday Brazil's largest airline, **Azul SA**, reported yet another month of extraordinary growth with consolidated passenger traffic up 31.0%.  The company successfully achieved the difficult task, that faces all airlines, of growing capacity while maintaining load factor.  All the more notable when capacity increases 30.8%.  Azul will probably never trade at a premium but the valuation, at just 13.0x current year estimates, does look attractive.

Looking for recommendations and ways I can improve this for easy viewing of alot of information at once. I've found no free alternative that can compare unlimited stocks at once as well as graph all stocks. The red/green color coding based on percent returns is the first i've ever seen this done to the best of my knowledge.

What could use help right now is the expense ratio and dividend category. The dividend webscraping is not always working as should be. I built a calculator backend that auto generates 1 and 5 year graphs. Would like to separate stocks vs etf's vs reits etc and each have it's own graph. This is alot of work on the backend but once done it's all automated!

Future features looking to include would be DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan) to compare apples to apples comparison of dividend vs growth investing. I found a website that has this for a single stock analysis for this but not sure where/how to scrap data. I've seen where it uses a typical dividend but have only found one site that uses historical data and is free.

Beware on opening. I've found this sheet will crash the CPU thermal overload running click at 100% on my 2013 business laptop from school. No errors. Bang computer power off. lol. I also have a sheet to compare index funds to see all holding and growth of each. These used to be together but found was crashing google sheets. This sheet is huge and runs best for viewing on android where runs server and not client side so loads much much quicker on the cloud. Invesco ETF's ticker holding can be exported into excel to automate the process. Then can sort by best returns in past 10 years etc. 

Goal of posting this is that if people are willing to work together on this can add features. I don't think this will ever can be ""finished"" as wanting to add new features : ) I know this can all be done with paid software but the whole point of making this is that it's FREE, and a hobby to create cool things from scratch!

Stock Tracker Link, I have a testing page with different methods found for web scraping the data not avaliable on google sheets and building up the formulas.

“For every broker out there, trying to sell services with explicit fees is going to be almost impossible. The next frontier will be centered around providing more financial well-being solutions — expanding beyond just brokerage products,” said Bill Capuzzi, CEO of Apex Clearing, a custodian of securities on behalf of brokerage firms.

He added: “The brokerages need to connect the dots between banking, investing and lending,” he said.

Alice Milligan, chief customer officer for E-Trade, wrote in an e-mail to CNN Busines that  
“price really hasn’t been a competitive differentiator for some time, and we have always believed it’s about the customer experience more than anything else,”

Steve Quirk, TD Ameritade executive vice president of trading and education, told [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/investing/online-brokers-zero-commissions/index.html) that “In a world of equal footing, it’s all about what you are offering,”

According to TD Ameritrade, transaction revenue from its 11 million clients represents 15% of its net revenue. Schwab and E-Trade stocks fell 15% once Schwab made the announcement on October 1. TD Ameritrade shares decreased more than 25%.

Webull, a zero commission online trading platform, profits from lending products, including margin loans to customers who want to borrow money to purchase more stocks, as well as issuing stock loans to short sellers with the idea to buy the stock back at a lower price and fees from routing orders to exchanges.

Fidelity has yet to cut commissions to zero. “It’s interesting that Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade have deliberately chosen not to help the greatest number of their investors by automatically providing the highest interest rate on their cash sweep like Fidelity does,” the company said in a statement to CNN Business.

Robinhood, was one of the first online brokers with zero commissions upon its 2013 launch. And now its moving from zero fee brokerage to banking.

It failed 10 months ago to create a checking and savings account offering. It had announced cash management account with a 2.05% interest rate, an APY more than twenty times higher than the national average for savings accounts as projected by Bankrate.com.

Robinhood said in December 2018 that it would offer zero-fee checking and savings accounts with a 3% interest rate along with its brokerage accounts.

Robinhood [claimed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/sipc-chief-raises-concerns-to-sec-about-robinhoods-free-checking-accounts.html) to have partners like Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, Citibank, Bank of Baroda and U.S. Bank. and also said the 2.05% interest rate could still “fluctuate with market conditions” similar to the Fed funds rate, said Josh Elman, Robinhood’s VP of product.

I really don't like to post these up any earlier than Friday's because sometimes the calendars can look a bit wonky where you might see some companies on the calendar that are actually not scheduled to report, or are reporting on another day, etc etc. but unfortunately I don't really have much of an option here...it's either putting this up now or no earnings thread at all for next week. Anyway, please do me this favor everyone and review carefully the companies that are scheduled to report on their respective days for next week. Admittedly, I did not get a chance to confirm all the companies that are on this week's calendar are actually reporting, but if you see something that doesn't look right, as far as a company that is listed up on this calendar on a particular day that isn't expected to report, please just post a little notice in this thread so that everyone is made aware of it! I'd greatly appreciate that. It's very possible that there are some company logos on this calendar that are misplaced here. FWIW, I do not create these calendars.

In a note to clients on Thursday, Goldman Sachs analysts say Netflix’s long history of competition should help it weather the streaming wars.

Netflix investors fear the company could lose ground to the bevy of streaming services due to launch from the likes of Apple, Disney and HBO.

Got my 30-50 results. 

Now I'm building my watchlist and will then begin digging into financial statements. 

My key takeaways of the Magic Formula and his book: 

-Focus on companies selling at low relative cost (""cheap"") and produce high returns on capital (""quality"" or ""good""). 

-Another way of putting it: Focus on companies that earn a lot and also invest their capital that produce high returns. 

-Buy/Hold and don't expect immediate results. Mr. Market is fickle. 

-Sell losses a week before the year ends to capture losses for tax purposes 

-Sell gains a week after the year ends to capture long term gain tax. 

-Repeat the process 

My questions:

Anyone here begin their analysis of stocks using this method?

(Bloomberg) -- General Electric Co.’s gaping pension deficit certainly stands out for its size. But the company is hardly the only one at risk of potentially shortchanging some of its employees come retirement.

All across corporate America, underfunded pensions have become the norm. Even now, a decade after the financial crisis, the largest plans face a shortfall of $269 billion, right about where it was 10 years ago. Years of low interest rates have largely offset gains in the stock market. Companies haven’t helped matters by lavishing money on shareholder rewards and clinging to assumptions about returns that proved to be too rosy.


Defined benefit plans, like your traditional corporate pensions, have largely disappeared from view in the past couple of decades as companies have embraced plans like 401(k)s.

The shareholders return on equity is 16.36% which is above average. Price to book sits on 1.7 and the current P/E is 9.16 (the lowest according to the last 10 years). On average, the P/E is used to be 19.86, so is really below the value it's used to trade. They have a huge profit margin, 38.17% and this margin grown up 10.70% every year.    
I really think this stock is well undervalued and according to their earnings, this stock should reach the price a share between 1935.54$ and 3667.92$ in the next 10 years.

When I bought into the fund, I was strictly looking at the present numbers and they seemed solid. However, now that the 2020 election is coming up and Warren is polling as one of the top three democratic candidates I am getting nervous. If she does indeed get elected, I fear that she will slaughter the healthcare sector even more.

I have looked at other countries that have implemented public healthcare, like Canada, and it seems like if Warren were to get elected we would see a flip in percent of private vs public healthcare. Currently in Canada, about 30% of Canadians healthcare is provided by the private sector. Whereas, in the United States, 67% is provided through the private sector.

As I understand it, a call allows me to commit to paying a lower commission in order to preserve a lower price, in the event the stock takes off later.

in the example below I've got 100 Nov 15th options with a  strike of 3 (and limit of 3).   What I'm assuming here is if the stock goes up from mid 2's range around early November and ends up north of the strike price of 3, then I would choose to excersise these options at about $30,000 at a price of $3/share.  If I don't excercise this trade, then I pay the commisisons of what looks like .05 \*100 options (or is it .o5 \* 10,000 shares = $500?). 

can someone help me understand what my costs would be in the screenshot scenario give a. the price goes above $3/share by nov 15th and I exercise and b. the price stays below $3/share and I don'e exercise?

&gt;Eatontown, N.J., Oct. 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Investview, Inc. ([INVU](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=invu)) announced its plan to launch a tender offer to exchange shares of its outstanding Common Stock for newly-created shares of Investview’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.  
&gt;  
&gt;As proposed, for every 500 outstanding shares of Common Stock, Investview plans to offer to exchange one share of Series A Preferred Stock, which has a liquidation value of $10.00 per share. The exchange ratio is subject to adjustment prior to the commencement of the Exchange Offer based on the then prevailing common stock price. As of October 2, 2019, the closing price of Investview’s common stock was $0.014 per share, and there were 2,697,876,966 shares of Common Stock outstanding. The Exchange Offer is expected to commence later in the month and will remain open for 20 business days.  
In the proposed Exchange Offer, each share of Series A Preferred Stock would entitle its holder to:  
(i)               quarterly cumulative dividends at an annual rate of 12%, or $1.20 per share, payable in cash, in kind or in shares of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, at Investview’s election, in priority as to dividends over the Common Stock,  
(ii)              a liquidation price of $10.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to the payment date in the case of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before any payment or distribution is made to holders of Common Stock,  
(iii)            500 votes per share, voting together with holders of the Common Stock as a single class upon all matters upon which stockholders are entitled to vote,  
(iv)            optional conversion by the holder at any time into 500 shares of Common Stock, and  
(v)             a right to participate pro rata, through December 31, 2021, with respect to issuances by Investview of any future equity or equity-linked securities, subject to certain exceptions.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,417234,public,self,$INVU release big share reduction and tender offering.

I am on my first year of trading and I want to redo my portfolio to concentrate on building meaningful positions and especially dividends. I basically want to sell everything now and then buy back in December which would give me time to allocate and budget accordingly. I personally believe recession is coming in the next 12 months but more likely sooner than later. 

This brings me 2 concerns: 

how much of my money should I keep out of the market in order to average down in case an impending recession finally begins? I was thinking 50/50 or 60 in 40 out. 

I want to start building my portfolio mostly with dividend paying stocks. During a recession obviously share prices go down but do dividend payments typically shrink? I want to get my hands on an ETF like VYM for a ‘safer’ dividend stock, a blue chip, probably MSFT for a middle ground between growth and dividends and something like FTS or AQN.TO for high dividend payouts that are more likely to have their share prices effected which would be easier to average down on in case of a recession.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Since then, it has gone down \~13%. I'm wondering if I should bite the bullet and sell or hold and pray that the healthcare sector starts to make some sort of return. 

When I bought into the fund, I was strictly looking at the present numbers and they seemed solid. However, now that the 2020 election is coming up and Warren is polling as one of the top three democratic candidates I am getting nervous. If she does indeed get elected, I fear that she will slaughter the healthcare sector even more. 

I have looked at other countries that have implemented public healthcare, like Canada, and it seems like if Warren were to get elected we would see a flip in percent of private vs public healthcare. Currently in Canada, about 30% of Canadians healthcare is provided by the private sector. Whereas, in the United States, 67% is provided through the private sector. 

So, what are your thoughts on the healthcare sector and how drastic would the effects be if the private healthcare sector usage were to drop \~30%?

My family has invested in KULR and I am personally acting as a consultant for KULR and have been compensated in shares for that role.

The cash refund is related to expenditures on eligible R&amp;D activities conducted in Australia during the Company’s 2018 financial year. The R&amp;D activities included work done in areas across PreveCeutical’s portfolio, including the Sol- gel nose-to-brain drug delivery system and the non-addictive analgesics programs, which are being conducted at the University of Queensland, Australia.
The refund received by the Company will support and reinforce the Company’s continued investments in its R&amp;D programs.
The R&amp;D Tax Incentive Program encourages companies to engage in R&amp;D programs, including ones that have the potential to improve global health outcomes, which boosts competitiveness and generates economic benefits locally.
PreveCeutical’s President and Chief Science Officer, Dr. Mak Jawadekar stated, “We are highly supportive of the Australian Government’s R&amp;D Tax Credit incentive which recognises the critical role of R&amp;D involved in potentially developing life-saving drugs, therapies and delivery devices. This refund would help enable PreveCeutical to further advance our proprietary therapeutic alternatives for preventive and curative therapies for some of the unmet medical needs.""

The float is likely to stay the same as well. Most interesting is the reason for the note in the first place, and such a small one that appears to be already paid off.

In the past days, I've created this excel file that will calculate the Intrinsic Value of a quote, supposedly in the way that Warren Buffet does.

To make it work you have to: 

1. Insert the ""Free Cash Flow Per Share"" of five years ago, and the one of the current year. The system will give the growth rate of the past years.
2. Insert what you believe the future annual growth rate of that stock will be.

Data have to be plugged in the grey boxes.

Download it and tell me what you think :)

Since it seems to be popular to think I am posting these accurate forecasts and updates but they are not of practical use, I'll start this with something I generally do not do, showing the profit/loss from my trade based upon the analysis so far.

So many times I've had people saying ""Show brokerage statements, then"". As if I can post the analysis and trade plans, but the actual records of these trades are some mythical beast I could never produce.

So let's deal with this now, because I am a full time trader. My job is to make money from the markets. Funnily enough, I have trades doing this ... so for all those saying this, I'll show you I walk my talk. Then based upon what you say, we'll learn a lot about you.

I really do loath to write such a shallow and low value post as this, I'd prefer to spend my time writing actionable analysis that I can benefit from, and other can if they use it well.

However, it is important to put this ill thought out conception that my job is to impress you rather than to trade well to rest. Hopefully it'll free up more time to be productive.

Every single one of the trades I have posted here I posted in real time when I was entering. I've shared how I did all of this. The trades are there in the statement, the timestamped analysis in my history. It can not be faked. I have nothing to gain by faking it.

The Stars Group (TSG) is up 33% this week after announcing a planned combination with Flutter Entertainment PLC, the owner of Paddy Power in the UK and Ireland. Flutter is getting a good deal, evidenced by a 6.6% jump in its own stock price, it is buying flutter for about 7x adjusted EBITDA before synergies.

But TSG share holders also look set to benefit from this deal as;

* TSG’s stock price has languished since it over paid for Sky Betting and took on too much debt. Flutter has much more reasonable debt levels and will be able to share the burden.
* TSG’s shareholders will benefit (along with Flutter stock holders) from a rise in Flutter since they are to receive 0.2253 shares in this all stock deal.
* Both entities will benefit from cost savings and the potential opportunity to dominate online betting in both Europe and the US.

That market in the US alone has been estimated at between $7 billion to $9 billion. Competition will be fierce but the opportunity should allow strong double digit growth for years to come and make the current valuation (even after this weeks rise) of just 9.2x current year estimates look far too cheap.

**Insider Buying**

On Monday, Barron’s reported that four directors (later joined by a fifth) purchased stock in GameStop Corp in the first open-market purchases by insiders since September of 2016.

The purchases were mostly above $5.00 and, even though the stock has since risen to $5.55, investors may still be interested as the stock has fallen around 66% this year. The company has been hit by an unrelenting slump in sales as customers switch to buying games online. However the outlook has some rays of light as the company should receive a boost by the launch of new consoles planned for next year.

**Acquisition**

Cedar Fair fell on Friday after the theme park operator turned down a $4 billion offer from Six Flags Entertainment, claiming it was inadequate. The stock closed on Friday with a market cap of $3.23 billion and there was no indication of a raised offer being forthcoming. However with synergies driving the deal, and with SG&amp;A expenses of around 15% revenues (and 120% net income), a compromise might yet be reached.

**Large Caps**

HP Inc dropped almost 10% on Friday (to $16.64) after the company announced a bold new strategy to reduce its workforce by 16% as part of a broad restructuring meant to cut costs and boost sales growth. HP announced that it expects profit, excluding restructuring costs and other items, to be $2.22 to $2.32 a share in fiscal 2020 (slightly above consensus $2.24). HP’s board also boosted the company’s share repurchasing plan by $5 billion on top of the $1.7 billion remaining on its existing plan. That looks significant compared to its current market cap of just under $25 billion.

The market was not impressed by the announcement but, if management are successful, the stock looks cheap at less than 7.5x forward earnings. Incoming CEO Enrique Lores (who is a long standing company man with about 30 years at the firm) said “We are really confident about the future of the company.”

**Speculative Opportunity**

Meet Group stock price jumped almost 25% on Thursday after the company raised Q3 guidance with CEO of Meet Group, Geoff Cook saying that ""New features including streamer levels, VIP badges, first time buyer bonuses and one-on-one video chat are contributing to meaningful business results. Further, we believe that the moderation-related headwinds related to our recent safety enhancements are largely behind us.”

Putting the moderation-related headwinds behind them is key as the stock price dropped a few months ago due to concerns that its app was too racy for Apple and Google and might even be banned. The firm has taken steps to address those concerns and now has industry-leading safety practices including a prominent alert button for abuse reporting which sends a screenshot to Meet’s 200 moderation employees for immediate review.

While Q2 results were reasonable, the updated Q3 guidance reassures investors that management’s eye is back on the ball trying to grow profits. Especially since Mr Cook also said he expected a strong Q4 ""Given the ongoing stabilization in our advertising business, we anticipate a seasonally strong fourth quarter in advertising,""

**Growth Stocks/High risk and speculative**

On Wednesday Zynex Inc, the non-invasive medical device company for pain management, announced 95% year over year order growth for the third quarter. CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the rise to the company's expansion of its sales force which has doubled over the past couple of years.

That’s key because the company has reported its goal to grow to 400 sales employees over the next few years and expects each to generate $1 million of sales. Margins in this business are healthy and should improve as the business grows. Gross margins were 80% at the last quarter and net margins 28%. Hitting the $400 million revenue target should generate net income well in excess of $100 million. In comparison, the stocks valuation at Friday’s close was just 3.65x that figure at $365 million.

I posted in the last weeks saying we should look for indices falling, and us being able to to take currency trades linked to this.

The topping pattern on these has further developed. It is important to understand that the topping patterns we have now are not ""Boy who cried wolf"" patterns. These are different from these previous ones people have thought they've seen. More advanced, and self confirming in each step. Something really seems to be happening here, it would be folly to not pay due attention to it.

We have the classic slanting head and shoulders. Strong neckline established. If the market breaks this neckline in a straight fall in the coming two weeks, sellers will have firm control of this market.

People have been getting this wrong over the last years, but they have been taking the bluff trades. Although this is not a ""textbook"" butterfly, those who trades these day to day know it's more practical to look for these bluffs before engaging the butterfly pattern.

# **Dow and S&amp;P 500 will try to snap a 3-week slide as US-China trade talks kick off in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/04/dow-sp-500-will-try-to-snap-a-3-week-slide-as-trade-talks-kick-off.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks will try to regain their mojo next week as China and the U.S. hold long-awaited trade negotiations in Washington.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9% this week while the S&amp;P 500 slid about 0.3%. Overall, the two averages posted their first three-week losing streak since August.
*****
&gt; Wall Street’s poor performance for the week comes after a disappointing U.S. manufacturing data report sparked fears of a recession. The report itself pointed to trade as a key source of weakness for the manufacturing sector, making next week’s trade talks the key focus for traders.
*****
&gt; “Trade talks are crucial, not just for the U.S., but globally,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The conclusion from central bankers, CEOs and CFOs is we’re slowing down.”
*****
&gt; “They are waiting for something constructive,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that U.S. manufacturing activity contracted to its lowest level in more than 10 years. This data sparked a two-day sell-off in which the Dow dropped more than 800 points. ISM Chair Timothy Fiore said trade “remains the most significant issue.”
*****
&gt; Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have heightened over the past year, with both countries exchanging tariffs on billions of dollars worth of their products. However, the tone around U.S.-China trade improved recently as China increased last month .
*****
&gt; White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow also said Friday that “positive surprises” could come out of next week’s negotiations. Chinese and U.S. negotiators are expected to meet next Thursday and Friday.
*****
&gt; But Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, warned signs of progress are crucial for the market moving forward. “Markets have entered a ‘show me’ phase,” he said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Investors will also look ahead to the Federal Reserve releasing the minutes from its September meeting on Wednesday. The Fed cut rates last month by 25 basis points for the second time this year, citing “the implications of global developments for the economic outlook” among other factors.
*****
&gt; “It seems to me Powell is laying the blame or the explanation for the weakness directly at the feet of the administration,” said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. “It’s growth outside of the U.S. It’s the parts of the U.S. economy that are exposed to trade that are being affected. Other than that, the economy is doing fine.”
*****
&gt; Nonetheless, the probability of a third Fed rate cut increased this week amid weaker-than-forecast services and jobs-growth data. Market expectations for an October rate cut rose to around 80% from about 50% in the previous week, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, ISM said the U.S. services sector grew at its slowest pace since August 2016. Meanwhile, data released Friday by the Labor Department showed slower-than-expected jobs growth in the U.S.
*****
&gt; Counterintuitively, the stock market got a boost after both data sets were released. The major averages posted solid gains on Thursday and rallied more than 1% on Friday with the Dow jumping more than 350 points.
*****
&gt; “With job growth decent but slowing, a contraction in manufacturing, the ongoing trade war, and low inflation, the Federal Reserve will cut the fed funds rate” later in October, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, in a note.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 10/4/19

&gt; All-in-all, it was a pretty mixed week for economic data, specifically manufacturing and labor data. While Markit’s gauge on manufacturing was slightly stronger than both expectations and the August print, ISM’s version disappointed with little in the way of bright spots among its components. Hard data, on the other hand, is showing a bit of a different picture as Durable Goods appear healthy with the fastest 3m/3m growth rate since last November as we discussed in Thursday's Closer. The Markit Services PMI and ISM’s Non-Manufacturing Index were also split with Markit’s reading holding steady as ISM disappointed once again. Employment data was the other major focus of the week with similar disappointments, but some silver linings. Ahead of Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls Report, ISM’s Employment components for both the Manufacturing and Services sectors further weakened in September while this week’s initial jobless claims rose slightly more than expected (although continuing claims fell again). ADP’s reading on employment also fell more than expected. The NFP report followed suit showing fewer jobs added in September, but new lows in the unemployment rate and underemployment rate added to the case of continued labor market strength.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/100419-Eco.png))**

&gt; Economic data takes a bit of a breather next week with only two-thirds as many releases this week. Consumer credit is first up on the docket and is expected to moderate to $15 billion after a very strong print last time around. On Tuesday, we will get confidence numbers out of the small business world. NFIB’s Small Business Optimism is forecasted to fall to 102.5 from 103.1 in August. PPI is also out that morning, although no change is expected for both the headline and core numbers. CPI data is due to be released later in the week on Thursday and likewise, no change is expected. Further in inflation data, on Friday, import and export price indices are also scheduled to be released. In labor data, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) will come out on Wednesday followed by weekly claims numbers the following day. After rising to 219K this week, claims are expected to improve to 217K. Finally, Friday’s preliminary University of Michigan Sentiment for October will round out the week. It is expected to fall to 92.0 after last month’s rebound up to 93.2.

# Labor Market Chugs Along

&gt; The U.S. labor market keeps chugging along, despite signs of weakness in other pockets of the U.S. economy.

&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose 136,000 in September, and July and August payrolls growth were revised up by 45,000. The 12-month average payrolls change climbed to 179,000 including Friday’s data, still slightly higher than the expansion average.

&gt; Overall, the September jobs report showed hiring has been steady, defying recent worries of economic weakness after surprisingly weak manufacturing and services surveys were released earlier this week. Other labor-market measures also look healthy. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September, a new cycle low, and initial jobless claims are still subdued.

&gt; Wage growth slowed notably last month, though, hinting that inflationary pressures could be moderating. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, average hourly earnings growth fell to 2.9% year over year, the slowest pace since July 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wage-growth-slips_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Slowing average hourly earnings growth could point to a cooling job market. However, average hourly earnings growth for production and nonsupervisory workers increased 3.5% year over year, indicating there could be temporary influences weighing down the overall wage measure. At any rate, 2.9% wage growth is still enough to buoy personal incomes and consumer spending while keeping interest rates at bay.

&gt; “Even though hiring has slowed slightly this year, it still looks healthy for the 10th year of this economic expansion,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Wages are growing near a 3% clip, and we still see evidence that domestic inflation is subdued enough to support an accommodative Federal Reserve.”

# October Most Volatile Month of the Year

&gt; Historically speaking, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) tends to reach its seasonal high in the month of October. This may be due to the fact that the two worst performing months of the year, August and September (by average performance) precede it. October also has the honor of slaying twelve, post-WWII bear markets. A bear market’s low is frequently accompanied by high levels of fear and market volatility. VIX’s seasonal pattern can be seen in the following chart. October’s peak and July’s low are indicated by blue arrows.

&gt; October’s volatility peak is also visible when actual daily percent changes are analyzed. October has hosted the most daily moves in excess of 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 7% and even 10% since 1930. Do not fret over the nine times S&amp;P 500 has moved more than 10% in a single day. Six of the nine occurrences were way back in the 1930’s. Only three have occurred more recently and out of those, two were actually positive days (10/13/2008 +11.58% and 10/28/2008 +10.79%). Actually only two of the nine days with moves in excess of 10% were negative days: 3/18/1935 –10.06% and 10/19/1987 –20.47%.

&gt; Putting the table data into a bar chart adds a quick confirmation of October’s heightened volatility versus all other months.

# Some October Weakness Common in Pre-Election Years

&gt; It certainly did not take long for the market to trigger Octoberphobia this year. Tuesday’s soft manufacturing report was at least part of the trigger. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have already declined over 2.6% and its just the second trading day of the month. Tomorrow’s Non-Manufacturing ISM report and Friday’s jobs report could sooth some of the current recession fears and warrant close attention. However, market weakness in October, even in pre-election years is common. Our recent post showed October ranking second worst of all month in pre-election years.

&gt; October’s tepid history in pre-election years can also be seen in the following seasonal pattern charts. The only real notably difference between this year and past pre-election years is weakness has arrived earlier. Looking at the black line in each chart, the average pre-election year October pullback has been around 3% for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. A larger pullback this year would not be out of the question considering trade, growth and political uncertainty. If economic data proves resilient, then the usual end of year rally enjoyed in past pre-election years will likely materialize.

On Monday, Scientific Games Corp chairman Ronald Perelman bought a further 50,000 shares of the slot machine and gaming products firm at $20.42. It was his fourth recent purchase and follows the announcement, on September 25th, that the company had won the tender to supply lottery terminals to SISAL in Italy. The company said that it would represent one of the largest lottery terminal point-of-sale networks in the world.

Scientific Games also recently reported that it had expanded its sports betting partnership with Caesars Entertainment (adding the fast growing Indiana market) and that it had won a 10-year contract to supply the Turkish national lottery Milli Piyango.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value Stocks**

Bed Bath and Beyond had a mixed week with earnings on Wednesday reporting comps down 6.7% (although earnings did beat at 34 cents versus 27 cents expected). However, a number of commentators were making positive observations. Generally they were along the line that shop closures and sales promotions should have a reduced effect going forward, boosting margins as planned, and that the stock looked cheap compared to cash flow and a strong balance sheet.

In particular, an analyst at Wedbush upgraded the home goods retailer to outperform from neutral on Monday and raised the stock price target to $16 from $14 (current price $10.09) saying that the value of hidden and non core assets (that activist shareholders are pushing to be sold) are worth almost the same as the market cap plus net debt of the company.

If they are correct then the company could pay off all the debt and return $9.40 to shareholders who would still own the core retail business.

To be exact the Wedbush analyst said, ""our work indicates that the value of the company's real estate and non-core assets are worth $1.7 billion, nearly equivalent to the company's $1.8 billion enterprise value, meaning you almost get the company's core Bed Bath business for free.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Large Caps**

HP Inc dropped almost 10% on Friday (to $16.64) after the company announced a bold new strategy to reduce its workforce by 16% as part of a broad restructuring meant to cut costs and boost sales growth. HP announced that it expects profit, excluding restructuring costs and other items, to be $2.22 to $2.32 a share in fiscal 2020 (slightly above consensus $2.24). HP’s board also boosted the company’s share repurchasing plan by $5 billion on top of the $1.7 billion remaining on its existing plan. That looks significant compared to its current market cap of just under $25 billion.

The market was not impressed by the announcement but, if management are successful, the stock looks cheap at less than 7.5x forward earnings. Incoming CEO Enrique Lores (who is a long standing company man with about 30 years at the firm) said “We are really confident about the future of the company.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth Stocks**

Spotify Technology SA was upgraded this week by analysts at both Evercore ISI and Credit Suisse although neither are yet recommending a buy. The change of heart seems to be the falling valuation. The stock is down over 35% from all time highs and has a capitalization of $20.8 billion which is about 3.5x trailing revenues. Quite reasonable for a stock that is expected to grow annually by almost 30%.

i am an investor only interested in capital gains instead of dividend growth. I want to talk you guys about a stock i've been following recently to see what's your thoughts on that.  
The stock I am taking about is the multinational biotechnology Biogen (**NASDAQ:BIIB**) and it's current traded at 224$.

This stock have seen in March a 20% down in price due to an halt of Alzheimer's research disease, which created a buying opportunity.  
The company was founded in 1978 and for the last 10years have been rock solid in their earnings growing from 3.35$ to 21.58$, from 2009 to 2018. The company is almost debt free and have a shareholders equity return of 30.74% and a return of total capital of 23.29%. The profit margin is at 32.93%. Over the last 10years the company have been repurchase his shares which is always a good sign and the current P/E just hit the lowest P/E of the last 10 years, 8.19.   
The price to book ratio is at 3.15 and its in line with the rest of the industry.  
This stock have a potential of CAGR in stock price of 20.99% according to past EPS and should be traded around 1574.22$ 10 years from now.

But it avails to know that being erroneous is inevitable and normal, not some terrible tragedy, not some awful failing in reasoning, not even deplorable fortuity in most instances. Being erroneous comes with the franchise of an activity whose outcome depends on an unknown future.

The logical corollary that follows from the conception that all investments involve uncertainty is that some of them will lose. It additionally denotes that we cannot know in advance which ones will lose. If we did, we would not make those investments in the first place. Hence losses are a component of the nature of investing.

Context/justification if you care:
I have just started my career and begun to accumulate excess savings which I want to invest.  I'm 27 years old.  Over the course of the next few years my savings accumulation will greatly outstrip the growth of my current portfolio.  As a result I am seeking only to maximize expected value and I have no interest in minimizing risk.  I have larger separate pot of savings in case of any personal crisis.  

I don't know enough to options trade and I don't have time to carefully pick stocks.  With this small initial pot of money I would like to maximize volatility and expected value.  I am limited by knowledge constraints to picking a simple set of rules.  I understand that I won't beat the high frequency traders and sharks, but I have made some observations:

1. In most historical periods you make more than you lose on average if you buy a single stock at random and hold it for one year. 

2. Past and future performance are obviously correlated but the relationship is essentially infinitely complex.  

3. The markets have many intelligent actors as well as many actors who are either irrational or slow to act due to institutional restrictions.  (obviously including me)

What I am wondering is: is it completely stupid to pursue simple strategies such as: 

* Pick a stock that has grown steadily in the past year and hold it for six months
    * Basically a first order approximation
    * Averaged over modern history, will an average stock chosen by this method win out over a basket of stocks selected by total market cap (i.e. the S&amp;P 500), albeit with much higher volatility?

Or reactive strategies:

* Buy quickly after a sudden price drop such as one caused by a recession

* Sell quickly after a large price jump which limited analysis indicates may be due to a bubble

What I am getting at is, to what extent is it a complete fallacy to attempt to throw simple rules at the stock market? Are markets today so efficient that all such information is already included in prices? Or is it the case that using such simple strategies is better than using no strategy at all (i.e. does a simple strategy win or lose compared to a completely random strategy or buying the S&amp;P 500).

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I'm still reading about how to do that wisely, and I have some questions.

From what I see, there is a withholding tax of 30% on dividends for NRA investors from a country without a tax treaty (which I think is the case with Brazil), is that correct? Is that tax handled directly by the Broker or I need to do something about it?

Here in Brazil, most ETFs (if not all) reinvest the dividends, is that the same for US ETFs? Or are the dividends distributed (I'm looking mostly to Vanguard ETFs if that is important)?

If they are reinvested I suppose there is no withholding tax, correct?

What about capital gains, are those taxed for NRA investors? Is it the same withholding tax?

For ETFs most time I see people saying to just open an IB account and invest solely on Ireland based ETFs that track the US market, is that the recommended approach? I really would like to do stock picking on some companies I believe, but still have most of my portfolio in a few ETFs. I have no current plans to invest in REITs because of that withholding tax.

We're hearing a ton about PMI slowdown being the worst levels since 2009, ADP job growth under expectations, and overall global slowdown. YES this is all concerning, but I believe there is an underlying factor that is not being discussed enough, **Baby Boomer Liquidation**. I'll use the range from 1946 to 1964, the oldest baby boomer is about 73 and the youngest would be 55 for the purpose of this conversation.

From my stand point, with my parents approaching retirement age, I do not see why any 55-73 year old would have money in this volatile market. I think as we begin to see more negative data (ie all these negative PMI/ADP/GDP), we're going to see accelerated selling by this specific demographic trying to preserve wealth, both 401ks and normal portfolios. Additionally, with people working a bit longer than they used to (i dont have the data), I can imagine people probably have kept their money in the market a little longer than they should have, or at least if they're under 65, they still likely have exposure.

Overall just wanted to start a discussion about this, does anyone feel similar? I don't wanna go throwing around the R word lightly, this time feels a bit different than the last few pullbacks. I have liquidated all my stocks as of yesterday afternoon.

Those once promising unicorns are starting to look like a bunch of wounded animals. Highly anticipated companies such as Lyft (LYFT), Uber (UBER) and Slack (WORK) are down from their IPO price. SmileDirectClub (SDC) alone fell 28% on its first day of trading.

While there have been a few success stories this year such as Beyond Meat (BYND), struggles from companies like WeWork are showing the difficulties in the IPO market. If you’re looking for a company to pop on its first day of trading, there’s one sector you should be on the lookout for, according to EY's Americas IPO expert, Jackie Kelley.

I am trying to broaden my understanding of the order book in level 2 market data and how I can draw conclusions from it. Based on the screenshot below, The number of limit sells gets a lot steeper as you approach 295 for SPY. Based on this idea, could you draw the conclusion that because of everyone’s limit-sells at 295, when the price approaches 295, the underlying price is likely to move downward because of the influx of sellers?

Does Level 2 data also factor in stop-buys and stop-losses? For example, if tons of people decide they want to buy SPY on the upswing and put in a stop order to buy it at 296, is that shown in the order book at all?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I don't use this tool in my daily work, but have thought that maybe I can use it to manage my personal portfolio? I work in strategy consulting, not sales and trading or really anything financial services related, so this kind of tool is pretty new to me.  


I see there are some cool dashboards and charts I can make but I don't think I'm using it to its full potential.  


Does anyone have any tips or guidance on how I can use this tool to help my own personal investing profile? Or any other cool uses?

AVITA Medical (ASX: AVH, NASDAQ: RCEL), a regenerative medicine company with a technology platform positioned to address unmet medical needs in therapeutic skin restoration, announced that its American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) have been approved to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq).

I am highly experienced in the do-it-yourself trading area, as well as ultra high net worth asset management.  I dismantled this dude so bad that he deleted his entire comment history. 

I really hope that when people ask questions, that people wont just answer with their assumptions or one-off experiences.  In this case, we were being sold something.  The ""person"" selling the crap sent me a weird private message that seemed like an ""accident"", in the middle of dismantling everything he was saying.

It is the weekend of the final week of September, 2019.  The next trading week will be the trading week of October.  The S&amp;P500 has closed the week at 2966 after opening 2998. This might not sound like a big fall, but the bulls have lost a critical fight in the markets this week. In the coming two weeks, it seem likely the bulls will start to quit. Pullbacks will continue to make lower highs, and then bears will continue to drive the market to new lows.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have explained here is an uptrend failure, and the transition into a downtrend.  The downtrend has a dominoes like effect.  One trend continuation levels fails and price falls. The next bigger level fails, price falls more. Another price level fails, and there is a bigger still drop.  It is this cascade of events that builds up to be these ""S&amp;P500 dropped 20% today"" news headlines we see in crashes.

&amp;#x200B;

I showed the first major trend failure in part 2, when I showed how I opened trades to position from the drop with China walking out of a meeting.

# Review of Previous Forecasts

&amp;#x200B;

Last week in part 2 I said after we'd seen the first trend failure level we should look for certain warning signs in price. The candles that would form if there were to be failures of other trend levels were drawn onto the S&amp;P500 chart.

&amp;#x200B;

And I said these would be the warning signs in the order they would appear.

[https://imgur.com/Nfmgo4U](https://imgur.com/Nfmgo4U)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same chart in the previous picture, and here is the first warning candle I've drawn presenting itself.

I've also added in the price formation of what the big warning signal will be.  A drop of around 10%,  close to 2650 low. This will probably happen in a very small period of time, hours or even minutes. Highly likely there will be a news related catalysis.

[https://imgur.com/Nfmgo4U](https://imgur.com/Nfmgo4U)

&amp;#x200B;

Last week in part two I said we should look for these warning candles along with an escalation in new news events. Something unexpected that could rapidly snowball.

In the first week of October price ranges in the 2940 - 2970 area. Does not go up a lot, does not go down a lot. Spends a lot of time pretending it will do one of these.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a  terrible sign. It tells us the bull are not coming in. Not the ones that matter, anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

We close the week quite flat,  close to the opening price.

In the **second week of October, there is a sharp 10% drop in the S&amp;P500. Low in around the 2650 area.**

# **The third quarter was a dud for stocks, but the fourth quarter could be full of surprises  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/fourth-quarter-could-hold-plenty-of-surprises-for-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; The third quarter wraps up in the week ahead with stocks just slightly higher for the period, after a summer of zigzag moves.
*****
&gt; The market faces some of the same challenges in the final quarter of the year, including Brexit, the trade war with China, sluggishness in the global economy and the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. By mid-quarter, the U.S. presidential election will be just a year away, and it could become a factor that could start to trigger market volatility.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 1%, finishing at 2,961.
*****
&gt; For the year to date, the S&amp;P 500 is up 18.1%, but in the third quarter, so far, it added just 0.7%. The S&amp;P started the quarter at 2,752, went as high as 3,028 before falling back. It has chopped in a range down to about 2,860, and has repeatedly struggled to get back to its high.
*****
&gt; “We think you stay within the range — 2,820 to 3,030,” said Julian Emanuel, BTIG head equities and derivatives strategist. Emanuel’s year-end target has been 3,000.
*****
&gt; “We see new highs, whether they happen in the fourth quarter or in 2020, as a function of geopolitical developments. From our point of view, the developments of the last several weeks, particularly [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren rising in the polls, increases in our mind the probability you get some sort of deal with China,” he said.
*****
&gt; Analysts said there could be more volatility because of the efforts by House Democrats to impeach Trump. The investigation into the president has to do with his withholding of aid to Ukraine and whether it was tied to a request to get dirt on front running Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
*****
&gt; Warren, D-Mass., whose tax and other policies are viewed as unfriendly to markets, is catching up with Biden in the polls, and some strategists see her benefiting from any negative news on Hunter Biden’s dealings with a Ukraine gas company. Emanuel said if Warren continues to gain, that may encourage China to move forward with a trade deal with Trump, for fear making a deal with Warren would be more difficult.
*****
&gt; Besides political headlines, there is some key data coming out in the week ahead, including Friday’s September employment report, and ISM and PMI manufacturing data on Tuesday. The economy is expected to have added 145,000 jobs, above the 130,000 last month, while the unemployment rate is expected to stay steady at 3.7%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “We expect another month of census-related hiring to push public sector payrolls higher and, as a result, we forecast only 120k increase in private sector payrolls,” notes Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “Our forecast for private sector employment gains in September would represent some improvement relative to August, but our forecast overall remains consistent with our outlook for slower employment growth on the heels of deceleration in economic activity.”
*****
&gt; There are also a number of Fed speakers scheduled for next week, including New York Fed President John Williams; Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren.
*****
&gt; Trade will remain a major topic for markets, as U.S. and Chinese negotiators get closer to Oct. 10 talks. Headlines Friday that the White House is considering blocking or limiting U.S. investments into China sent stocks lower, after optimism about the talks lifted them early in the day.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the fourth quarter may have a different tone from that of the third quarter, after the wild move lower in rates during August and early September. He expects bond yields have bottomed, and he favors some of the cyclical names, like financials and energy.
*****
&gt; “The likelihood is long-term yields move higher, and you could see some form of switching out of bond exposure and into stock exposure. That type of embracing of the stock market is typical of final innings,” for markets, he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said the impeachment efforts against Trump may ultimately not have a negative impact on stocks. Even if he is impeached by the House, the Senate would be expected to acquit him. Analysts liken the possible reaction to be more like when President Bill Clinton was impeached and acquitted by the Senate than when President Richard Nixon was facing impeachment proceedings. Nixon resigned before he was impeached.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained 28% in the year after impeachment efforts began against Clinton, but lost 39% in the year after they were begun against Nixon.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the 2020 presidential election could also come into play this quarter, and Trump may take actions to boost the economy, such as finding a solution to the trade war with China. A resolution could give a boost to stocks.
*****
&gt; “People are very nervous and in general reasonably well-hedged because they remember the fourth quarter of last year so well, and from our point of view, we don’t necessarily see this trading range resolve itself any time soon,” said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Markets will also be watching the Fed’s repo operation Monday. The Fed has been conducting open market operations to assure there is enough cash in the short-term funding market, which was under stress at the start of last week. The Fed has calmed the market, but market pros are watching to see how much activity there is and whether rates rise. The final day of the month typically sees a surge in cash requirements, and on Monday, investors may require cash for the settlement of $113 billion in Treasury securities.

# October’s First Trading Day Mixed Over Last 21 years

&gt; Based upon data in the soon to be available Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2020 on page 88, the first trading day of October is DJIA’s fourth weakest of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA points gained. June, August and September have been weaker. S&amp;P 500 has been down 10 of the last 21 years on the first trading day of October. DJIA’s record is slightly softer with 11 declines and NASDAQ’s performance has been the worst of the group, down 12 times with an average loss of 0.36%.

# Fruitful to Sell Rosh Hashanah

&gt; Happy Jewish New Year to you all! I took the above picture of pomegranates last year in Tel Aviv’s Carmel Market during my adventure through Israel with my family in celebration of my eldest son’s bar mitzvah.

&gt; As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.” It gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

&gt; The basis for this, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,” pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away – and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

&gt; Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 88 Stock Trader’s Almanac). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64f4f19e19c5f8d9bb768316134c46af/9ac6dde39074b5e0-62/s640x960/be7a91356b29ad1cdc61cb6e117a0a05e2127cd3.jpg))**

&gt; Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 59% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%.

&gt; This year the high holidays commence on Sunday eve, September 29, and end October 9 with Yom Kippur right in time for Octoberphobia. The current news flow already has folks selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays, setting up the market for further declines in notoriously volatile October.

# What If September Is Up?

&gt; Well, when the worst month of the year is up, it’s not so bad. October is slightly better when September is up. But Q4 and the rest of the year are generally more positive. In the tables below September is ranked by largest gain for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and NASDAQ since 1971. Q4 remains about average, but full year gains are above average. So if September can eke out a gain then watch out for Octoberphobia, but fear not the full year.

# Financials Hold on to Broad Gains in September

&gt; In spite of the relative weakness we have seen in equities over the last week, US stocks are still poised to finish off September and the entirety of Q3 in the black. While overall breadth among industries was more positive several days ago, there are still four sectors where every industry is still in the black on a month to date basis. As shown in the graphic below, all of the industries within the Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities sectors remain in the black for the month of September. To be fair, Energy and Real Estate each only have two industries in their respective sectors, so for these two sectors, it isn't quite as impressive. Within the Financials sector, though, all five are still up on the month while all three industries in the Utilities sector are also up MTD.

&gt; In the Energy sector, even with this month's gains of over 4%, both industries in the sector are poised to finish Q3 with a decline. Utilities have been big winners so far this quarter, but Electric Utilities have been the clear leader with an eye-popping gain of 10.2% this quarter.

# Looking for Action? S&amp;P 1500 Most Volatile Stocks

&gt; For traders with a short-term time horizon who are looking for big moves, we have updated our list of the S&amp;P 1500 stocks trading above $10 that have the largest intraday high-low ranges (based on the average percent spread between the intraday high and low over the last 50 days). The stocks are grouped based on whether they have a rising or falling 50-day moving average (DMA).

&gt; While the VIX remains relatively low, in recent months we have started to see some big moves in individual stocks and that can be seen in the fact that a number of stocks in the table below currently have average intraday ranges of more than 5%. The most volatile stock in the S&amp;P 1500 is Lennox International (LII), which has had an average intraday high-low range of 9.5% over the last 50 trading days. Granted, it's only an $11 stock, so the 9.5% average range works out to just about a dollar per day, but it is still volatile nonetheless. Behind LII, there are another three stocks with average daily moves of over 8%, but here again, they are all relatively low priced stocks trading at less than $20 per share. The highest-priced stock on the current list is Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). With a share price of $91 and an average daily move of over 5%, IIPR typically sees an intraday swing of over $5. That's a trader's dream if you trade it right, but a nightmare if you get it wrong!

&gt; In terms of sector representation on this month's list, Consumer Discretionary is the most prevalent with 17 different stocks. Behind Discretionary, the next closest sector is Energy at eleven. Finally, with regards to the breakdown between stocks with rising and falling moving averages, there are modestly more stocks with falling moving averages (29) than rising moving averages (21), suggesting some underlying weakness even with the broader S&amp;P 500 trading not far from new highs.

# Manufacturing: Doing Okay or In Collapse? It Depends Who You Ask.

&gt; Last night in The Closer, we discussed the huge divergence between regional Fed manufacturing activity indices and the ISM Manufacturing Index. In the chart below, we've created a proxy for the ISM Manufacturing Index by averaging sub-indices from various regional Fed manufacturing surveys. The result is generally well-correlated to ISM, but over the last few months the two have diverged wildly. While the Five Fed indices from the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Fed districts would indicate an ISM reading in the mid-50s, the actual readings have been deteriorating dramatically. Of course, these three Fed districts are a relatively small snapshot of the overall national economy, but collectively their sample size is similar to the ISM's. It's hard to say which is ""right"", but the huge divergence is certainly noteworthy.

Western Union presented a new three-year financial outlook on Tuesday and detailed plans to grow its core consumer-to-consumer business. Short term, it is targeting low double-digit annual EPS growth over the next three years. Longer term the company aims to win partnerships with e-Commerce businesses expanding into emerging markets.  Management expects to generate $3 billion in operating cash flow and to return over $2.5 billion to shareholders from 2020 to 2022. A significant amount for a company with a market cap of $9.3 billion. 

The market did not appear impressed and the stock fell over 2% before regaining those losses and adding a small profit.  However, the valuation still looks cheap with a trailing PE of just 8.4.  BTIG analyst Mark Palmer's seems to agree.  He said that the company is a ""resilient 'cash cow' and underappreciated digital platform"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Large Caps

Cintas reported strong Q1 earnings on Tuesday.  The latest in a series of earnings beats for the uniform rental company.  In fact over the past four years revenues have increased 45% and earnings are up 95%.  But the valuation at 4x revenues and 32x earnings does seem to be getting ahead of itself after a 60% increase YTD.  Management did increase guidance but they are still only projecting 12% earnings growth this year at the mid point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speculative Opportunity

NetSol has given up nearly all its gains after reporting a strong finish to the year on Monday and is now trading on a trailing PE of just 10.  That’s understandable given, as a software developer for automobile financing and leasing companies, it operates in a fairly cyclical sector and is probably not the top stock choice for all investors.

However the opportunity presented by NetSol on Monday is much greater than its legacy business.  The most important takeaway from the call were management’s comments about developing a new car sharing platform called OTOZ. 

OTOZ is a new enabling platform where OEM, auto finance companies, car dealers and car users converge to create supply and demand for cars that are connected, insured, fueled, charged, cleaned, accessible and ready for all types of journeys, an hour, a day, a week, a month or years.

NetSol, through their existing business, have built up a huge ecosystem of OEM over 100 auto finance companies, over 25 million end customers, over $300 million in auto assets and over 30 million cars.  OTOZ plans to leverage these assets to establish it as the largest player in creating an on-demand shared mobility platform. None of the big players globally or any of NetSol’s competitors are believed to be able to claim access to such a deep and broad ecosystem.

OTOZ’s development and discussions with partners remain at an early stage. However, the potential of the venture could be transformative for this $60 million stock.

There is a big opportunity for Appian, the “low-code” applications developer, as it makes it easier and faster for companies to build applications by removing as much of the hand-coding as possible.  More evidence for this was provided on Monday when the company announced a new solution for accelerating the on boarding of financial services institutions while reducing the risks of implementation.

The company’s valuation of $3 billion or 10x revenues is not what you would consider cheap. However Appian's ""low-code"" software development tools are catching on fast. It helps its customers easily build their own applications, saving them time and money in the process. Companies are flocking to its platform, and existing customers tend to spend more on Appian's services over time, as seen in the torrid growth of Appian's subscription revenue which grew 41% last quarter.

Appian management believe the total opportunity facing the company is $31 billion.  Compared to that the $3 billion valuation looks more reasonable.

Insider Buying

Not much insider buying this week with earnings season approaching but I did notice that GT Gold President and CEO,  Paul Harbidge, bought 75,000 shares at C$1.02 per share on September 18th and Charles Greig, VP of Exploration, bought 25,000 shares on September 9th.

The purchases follow a report that was signed off by both Mr Harbridge and Mr Grieg on September 4th announcing the results from the next eleven drill holes at the 100%-owned Tatogga Project, in northwest British Columbia. The results confirmed “the continuity of excellent and increasing grades between the near-surface mineralization through moderate depths to the

deeper and generally highest grade mineralization”.

Mining billionaire Ross Beaty is also a prominent shareholder of GT Gold holding 8% of stock. He apparently is nicknamed the 'broken-slot' machine due to his knack of consistently making his investors rich. I don’t think I’d read too much into that name but it is reassuring to see senior executives backing up their comments with purchases. (Stock price at Fridays close was $0.96)

Pharmaceuticals

PolarityTE stock briefly rose 6% on Monday after positive results from a study of its SkinTE skin regeneration product in patients with difficult-to-treat wounds.

📷

All 15 patients who received a single application of SkinTE achieved complete wound closure. It also appears to be cost effective with a reimbursement of $30 per square centimetre compared to peers Integra (over $60) and MiMedx ($160).

The CEO has previously quantified the size of the burns market at $5 billion and the larger market, when taking into account the skin regeneration market across all potential applications, at between $50 billion or $60 billion. That compares to the market capitalisation of just $91 million.

The stock has given up Monday’s gains and another 15%.  Admittedly, the company still has a long way to go with the approval but the positive results are a step forward and the combination of effectiveness, cost savings and large TAM make the valuation at these levels appealing

In the same trading patterns of recent days, the S&amp;P500 rose a bit in the Asia and European sessions, and then started to sell off in the US session.  [This was apparent within the first hour of the New York open.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingAlerts/comments/d9zvpa/same_recurring_pattern/)

After a first sell off and attempted break of 2970 there was a retrace to 2980.  From 2980, price made a big one ,minute candle breaking under 2970, and then in the following momentum down trended through 2960.   The low was made around 2945 before the market closed  close to the 2960 level.

&amp;#x200B;

Attempts at breaking recent highs failed, and new lows were made.  Although I've been saying this looks like a bear market for over a month now, this was the first time the market has strongly confirmed this.

&amp;#x200B;

If the pattern is to continue, we should have a sideways week ahead of us. Price should hold a general range of 2940 - 2970 and not do much more in the coming week.  We're looking for little holding pattern / consolidation and indecision candles. Things like spinning tops, dojis and the like.

I am a 21 years old and just started investing a year ago. Since I have started, I invested fully into VWRL every month (DCA). However, as I am relatively young I am strongly considering to invest a portion into a couple of stocks for long-term strong wealth building (only selling if necessary due to stagnation or no future growth anymore, scandals etc.). As, I am already diversified through an ETF (VWRL), I am thinking to add 5 stocks to my portfolio of which these 5 stocks should amount max. 10% of my portfolio. The rest 90% in an ETF.

My screener on Finviz gave me the following results for potential stocks but still 616 to choose from...

I will specifically be looking at the reaction to Q2 earnings, and the possibilities from the recently announced NFL and NHL partnerships.

* Michael Burry took an activist stake in TLRD, and sent multiple letters to the board demanding a reduction in, or an elimination of, the dividend.
* The CEO strongly hinted that he assumes top line will remain relatively stable between Q2 and Q3. He strongly implied that the low EPS guidance was because of turnaround initiatives coming online.
* Newly announced NHL partnership. Proves that sports leagues see value in such partnerships, and increases likelihood that all major sports leagues will sign on with TLRD.
* Sports league sales alone can more than offset otherwise declining SSS.
* TLRD trades at a fraction of quarterly revenue

TLRD beat their Q2 guidance by over 15%. But the market freaked out over the dividend suspension and the lowered Q3 guidance, to the tune of a 33%+ drop. However, if a little digging reveals this may be a big overreaction.

**Burry was demanding that something happen to the dividend, and he was right.**

Share repurchases and debt paydowns are strictly superior to paying the dividend. Part of the big drop was dividend funds eliminating their stake in the company -- a great reason to buy the dip.

**Top line likely to remain stable between Q2 and Q3.**

From the CC, the CEO had this to say about the guidance:

*“Our guidance for Q3 combines a number of inputs. But one is obviously the traffic trends that we've observed for the start of the quarter. Another is our view of what the promotional environment will be like. And then the third is the timing of certain strategic cost savings and customer facing initiatives reaching scale. As far as the promotional activity and the traffic as I think, those were similar to what we were seeing in Q2.”*

So what is driving the low EPS guidance? By process of elimination, one or more of the **turnaround initiatives are reaching scale**. What might these be? There were hints from the CC:

*“we experimented with additional labor on the weekends. That experiment was a winner. We saw a meaningful lift in sales with the test stores that more than paid for the additional labor, and we are in the process of scaling this new labor model more broadly.”*

If you track hiring trends, you’ll notice that TLRD has substantially stepped up its hiring in recent weeks.

*""We are very excited to continue to develop this NFL offering as part of our goal to deliver the ultimate personalized experience for our customers.”*

Now we know that it’s not just the NFL, but the NHL they’ve partnered with. If the economics of a partnership work for these two leagues, isn’t it likely that it will work for the NBA as well?

It’s safe to assume that TLRD will be spending money to promote these partnerships.

In light of this, it is clear that the market has misinterpreted the relatively low EPS guidance for Q3. Management sees opportunities to turn around the business in the very near term, and they’re going for them.

**Custom suit sales have been growing rapidly.**

“Our custom business continues to grow at healthy double-digit rates at the multi $100 million scale. In Q2, we averaged over 6 million a week in custom suiting, up from over 4 million a week in Q2 2018.”

**These sports league partnerships by themselves have the potential to turn around TLRD sales in the very near term**

The NHL has at least 27M fans by Facebook fan count ([http://www.stdium-maps.com/facts/nhl\_facebook\_table.html](http://www.stadium-maps.com/facts/nhl_facebook_table.html))

The NFL has at least 115M fans by professional estimates ([https://www.americanfootballinternational.com/countries-with-the-biggest-nfl-fan-bases/](https://www.americanfootballinternational.com/countries-with-the-biggest-nfl-fan-bases/))

For simplicity and conservatism, let’s ONLY consider NFL fans. The cheapest custom suit with sports lining is $445 + tax. As a primitive base case, assume that 0.5% of fans purchase a custom suit. Again, in the name of conservatism, let’s say they all buy the CHEAPEST variant. That is at least $256M in revenue. There’s only one month left in Q3. Furthermore, we can assume sales of these products will peak during playoffs, so let’s weight 90% of this revenue to Q4. That is $230M.

Let’s assume a baseline 5% decline in YoY revenue for Q4, so $746M. Add the revenue contribution from sports lining custom suits, and you arrive at $976M in Q4 revenue. This would be an ALL-TIME HIGH in quarterly revenue, by a long shot.

If the popularity of these suits really takes off, and you have 1% or 2% of NFL fans trying it, the bear case against TLRD dies on the spot, which is a beautiful thing when you have the absurd short interest that TLRD does.And if TLRD picks up the NBA, MLB, or NCAA, it gets much worse for the bear case.

**Think sports fans won’t go for custom linings?**

North American sports merchandising revenue was $14.5B in 2018. Remember that TLRD custom sports linings at $50 a piece, or \~11% of the revenue on the cheapest variant of the custom suit. A few tens of millions is a drop in the bucket compared to the total market size.

But enough analysis. Pictures are worth a thousand words:

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.
