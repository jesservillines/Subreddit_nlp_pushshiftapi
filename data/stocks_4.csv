I'm younger and seeking more higher growth and think tesla would be the best stock overall. However, I also feel it is beyond overvalued and is the most valued of the 5. I am more growth oriented and have dealt with loss in my portfolio before with Netflix last year, but Tesla is the most extreme stock on the market. 

I also feel confident in Amazon, but with the price being around 2000 a share I would only have 1 to 5 shares and I feel the percent gain I would get from those few shares wouldn't amount to much, or am I wrong about that? I also feel like Amazon at a near 1 trillion dollar valuation doesn't have much more to grow.

I'm also tempted to invest in Boeing because it's at a low, but it seems to be the lowest growing company on this list. So, the only reasons to invest it seem to be that it has a good dividend, and has a duopoly with Airbus.

Lastly, how do you all feel about Visa and Estee Lauder. The both have performed similarly the last 10 years, but have a low dividend amount and are relatively low growth companies compared to TSLA and AMZN. However, they seem to be the most reliable of the group and have less volatility and drops, and are also the least likely to go out of business.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Uber will manage legal issues, logistics, and process optimisation with data they already have on car rides. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, this is my thoughts, not based on any evidence. It applies to any other ride sharing company, as well as companies which work on autonomous driving. If anyone has already came up with this idea, please link - I'd love to read that.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously it's a look in the future, could be 3, 5, 10 years. I'm not optimistic that it will happen in next few years, but I think it's highly likely we will have it in 7+ years - as 5 might be not enough, while 10 is a bit much.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of negativity around Uber and Tesla. A lot have been said about Tesla, so I will move on to Uber.

People are caught up short term bad news, which are white noise in the long term. It's not profitable, faces a lot of legal issues in different countries. 

&amp;#x200B;

But Uber could be profitable today by upping their prices by 10-20% (I haven't done any calculations, it's just an arbitrary number). Consumers won't feel it much, but it would make a world difference for the company. Why don't they do it then? Because it's one of their moats. Their buisness model is easy to copy, but while they have cash to burn, they can dump prices and improve their services, work out legal issues and competition will stay in the dirt. Once regulations are done and services are feature full, it would require very little upcost to maintain the train going and refining it to earn profits. Uber CEO expects it to be net profitable in 2021 iirc.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, let's look further into the future. I'm a software developer, so I view this from my expirience and expertise. Elon was a software dev too, and his approach to problem solving is easy to understand. I think he still uses that brain framework and it did well for him.

&amp;#x200B;

There is fear that autonomous robotaxis will kill Uber's buisness. I believe that is not true. There will be a lot of issues to manage robotaxi network (I will go through it below). It's boring, and there is a smarter way to monetise your autonomous driving. Any software engineer would think on building a service and making others want to use it. Amazon, Google, Microsoft could have solved any software problem in the world, but they focus on cloud services for this exact reason. Writing software is easy, but to build a service this big you need huge capital investment, technology advantage and different kind of skill teams collaborating, which few have.

&amp;#x200B;

The goal is to get autonomous cars on the roads and get that profits from each ride going.

There are issues you would need to solve - these are off the top of my head, there should be more:

1) Parking spots - imagine Tesla hiring people just to solve that for each city. Uber already has data they can use to make quick, smart and low effort solutions on this. They can track&amp;learn where drivers stay idle. So Uber could be renting parking lots in popular places, or abusing unpopular parking spots, or whatever else.

2) Goverment regulations - Uber is already solving this problem, it is one of their moats. Nothing changes if you replace human with computer vision and algorithms. Once autonomous driving statistically is 5-10x safer than human (and I think Tesla could have already achieved that. There is huge power behind camera eyes looking at all directions, ever tireless with perfect reaction time), everyone will allow it. In the case of algorithm being the culprit of an accident, compensation will be paid from Tesla's insurance program.

3) Consumer patterns. Uber is already gathering huge data in all countries. So it can anticipate request loads at any place and point of time and optimise fleet distribution accordingly.

4) Charging people with car damage. There will be cameras in cars to watch passengers, but there always are idiots who would damage the interior.

5) Maintaining the cars. Any interior wear, cleaning or simple repairs.

&amp;#x200B;

Elon Musk is a big dreamer. He solves interesting tasks. These are stupid and tedious. Why would you spend time on it? Better solution is to create a service to lend cars. There would be an app for private owners (average Joe who buys a Tesla). It will allow them to summon their car, share rides etc. But why would average Joe buy a car? It's too expensive once you have a ride service like that. It's so cheap because you don't have to pay drivers. So Tesla creates an API, which is used by both this app, and companies like Uber. They lend cars to them, insure it, and Uber does all the stupid work. Both Tesla and Uber make revenue from each ride.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about this? Forgive any mistakes, not my native language.

For me it's a way to have a fun activity with a little skin in the game (kind of like sports betting) while learning about the market with minimal risk.

Quick question: a rule of thumb I have kinda stuck with is trying to get at least 20% returns when possible. Obviously if a stock is on a tear I'd want to let it ride, but if it gets around 20% then tapers off or retracts, I try to just lock in that 20% gain then on to the next opportunity. I'm willing to hold longer term if the rate of return is lower than that.

My view is that there's no where else you're going to find a 20% return in this economy so might as well take that opportunity when it presents itself. Obviously the stock could rebound and go higher but I feel like a 20% return is definitely a win.

I heard about it from Phil Town’s podcast last week. It’s the ratio of almost all US stock prices vs the GDP. 



The idea is basically that if the ratio is low, say &lt;40% then stocks right now are generally cheap. At 100% things are generally priced accordingly, and after 100% things are becoming expensive. It was under 40% until the 80s, and currently it’s at 170%. He uses this as an explanation/proof that things are very expensive right now.



The two main points I’ve heard from r/investing arguing that the Wilshire-GDP isn’t a useful indicator are:


&gt;1. If there were only 1 public company, the Wilshire-GDP would be almost zero.


Well yeah that’s true, but there isn’t just 1 company. In fact, there are [far fewer public companies right now than there have been historically](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/where-have-all-the-public-companies-gone-1510869125), so this doesn’t explain why the ratio is currently so high.


&gt;2. Many US-based companies now are globally involved, so it isn’t accurate to compare their revenue to the United States GDP.


This is true, and it’s important to keep in mind when talking about the Wilshire-GDP and its validity. Again though, [2018 sales brought in $665 billion in overseas sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/us-companies-bring-home-665-billion-in-overseas-cash-last-year.html) which does have an impact on the ratio. However, the impact isn’t as big when considering a GDP of $20 trillion.

We know all about the technological stocks, and the food stocks, and the major entertainment stocks, and the phone and credit card stocks, but what about the millennial stocks?  W-bull and R-hood allow random inexperienced, unseasoned strangers to play with stocks, and in w-bull’s case, allows public comments on each one. I think once more and more new people start investing, the more ‘emotions’ will take control over smart plays.  

And then a lot of stocks will run on hype, as opposed to the company’s actual numbers and prospects.  

And millennial entertainment (sportsbetting, weed, space, save the earth) will have a ton of hype.

Would investment companies be losing some of the market share of gains if individual investors became more prevalent? Maybe it's the opposite. Maybe new investors are more likely to lose so there are more gains to be had? Maybe it's a little of both?

Still, this seemed like a formidable run. I was curious just how rare such long weekly runs are. Also, once they end, do stocks typically reverse? Or do they just take a breather?

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to download weekly stock performance for all current constituents of the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, which combined to 514 different ticker symbols in all. The data came from Tiingo and went back as far as mid-1972.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I found (so far): The just-ended run, with its uninterrupted 69% gain was indeed the longest ever put in by $AMD. The previous record (from 2018) was at 10 weeks, while the most productive in terms of total return was an eight-week run in the fall of 1998, which took $AMD up over 106%.

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly or not, none of the FAANG stocks had any streaks extending beyond 12 weeks. Overall, I found that among the more than 322k streaks I logged, only 61 lasted for 14 weeks or more. The absolute longest, running for 23 weeks (!), was established in 1978 by SYY.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, though the numbers for upward and downward runs are evenly split, ""down"" runs are typically shorter. Among the 61 14-week-plus runs, only 5 were ""down"".

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time suggesting a stock to buy and hold, and plan to do more in the near future.

I've owned this stock for a couple months now and has been growing (and will continue to) very well!

PING IDENTITY $PING

They are a software company who recently IPO'ed in Sept. 2019 that provides intelligent identity access for companies and customers. By doing so, they can easily and safely connect to their cloud, SaaS, and APIs. Their platform contains single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, data governance, directory, access security, and intelligent security that uses artificial intelligence to block cyberattacks. Their economic MOAT is that companies can easily integrate Ping into their existing infrastructure and their keen ability to use artificial intelligence to block cyberattacks that would affect a whole company sets them apart from competition. Ping Identity's main goal is to ""prevent security breaches, increase employee and partner productivity and provide personalized customer experiences."" 

Reasons why I like this stock is because 

-Showing positive growth with the company as a whole. Their first earnings call as a publicly traded stock which was Q3 2019 reported an EPS of .13 over the expected .04, beating expectations by 255%

-Trusted and supplying to over 50% of the Fortune 100 with companies like Canon, Chevron, HP, Intuit, and Netflix

-Certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) 

-A 2018 article from Business Wire stated that, ""With a focus on driving customer experiences, HP selected the Ping Identity platform deployed in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This achieved its goal of instituting a single and highly secure identity and access management (IAM) platform across its entire global customer and partner-facing platform. The HP ID platform is used by more than 100 business applications, and enables single sign-on for over 150 million customer and partner identities across the world, plus thousands more being added each day. 

HP Product Manager Jared Meier sums up the success of HP ID, “Ping’s customer IAM platform provides performance and scalability that can keep pace with HP’s continued innovation and growth. Now, customers have a seamless experience when they authenticate across our digital properties.”

With that said, Ping Identity's ability to partner and have success with top companies around the United States is an indication that there is a great future for them going forward.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,468716,public,self,One of My Top Emerging Stocks Going Into 2020,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ep9wj3/one_of_my_top_emerging_stocks_going_into_2020/,all_ads,6,,tickerdiscussion,612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59,Ticker Discussion,,,,,

I made an error in judgment. On Monday I bought some BYND. I'll admit it was a bit of an impulse. I saw the news about new contracts and the initial rise, and I liked the price of 112 that it was at when I put in my order. I wasn't really paying attention to timing, though, and I put in my order after the market closed. Of course the market opened at 125, so my market order was at that much higher price. And as we all know the stock sank fast from that. I was thinking I'd go in at 112 and deal with some fluctuations before I think it's likely to eventually go up. I'm ""long on BYND,"" as you might say. But I screwed up the numbers so I'm down quite a bit in just two days. And it looks like it's still going to go down, more than I though it would.

Let's suppose you you invest at the worst possible time in the past 20 years, September of 2007 (that's actually worse than summer of 08), and that you held until the last couple years.

If you look at the charts (link above) which take into account fees and leveraged decay, you'll see that after 10 years it outperforms the index. More specifically, you'll see that after the crash it took the normal S&amp;P index (SPY) 4 years to get back to 0% return, whereas it took SSO an extra 1-1.5 years (about 5-6 years from the crash), about another year (about 7 years from the crash) to catch back up to the the SPY yield, and another 4-6 more years to get close to 2x-ing the SPY (got close in 2017 and currently it's close again). Keep in mind those comparisons take as a given that you invested in the worst possible time (right before the 2008 crash) and also that the market goes up (as it did) 50% over the course of the 7 years after the crash (that's about a 6% annual average return).

The argument, then, is that this bet makes sense given time horizons of 20-30 years.

And of course that's all absolutely worse case scenario. I expect it to do significantly better. If you'd have bought in, say, 2010, it was doubling the S&amp;P pretty consistently over time and after 2 years (2010 onward) it was significantly above 2x maintained until the current day (because of the compounding effect).

**Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)**)**

* A consumer digital health company, launched today with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.
* The platform analyzes data to build a picture of a person’s patterns, while dietitians and physiologists give them real-time advice about diet, medication and exercise by apps or text message. If a patient’s blood sugar is dangerously low or high, a coach will call to warn them within 60 seconds. Inspired by how big tech companies personalize services and nudge people into certain behaviors, Livongo — short for living-on-the-go — started by treating diabetes, before moving on to hypertension, weight loss and mental health.

**Why?**

* Livongo provides a truly disruptive technology and they're targeting a massive TAM (total addressable market). 90% of the $3.5 trillion spent annually on healthcare is dedicated to people with chronic and mental health conditions -- this is only expected to increase.
* It also just signed its [largest contract ever](https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-lands-biggest-contract-yet-2019-10) for the US government, allowing it to provide its diabetes solution to 5.3M employees as part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Platform starting in 2020. Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families — and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021. That's a significant lift given that Livongo brought in a total of [$68 million](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18262001.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE2MzkyMjUvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MTg1MTU5L2Q3MzEyNDlkczEuaHRt/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB050eba75) in revenue in 2018, it reported in its S-1 filing.
* LVGO's clients include 20% of the Fortune 500 (Target, Pepsi, Microsoft, Merck, and Citigroup) and boast a high retention rate of \~96%. They reported a 121% YoY growth in Q3 2019 and continue to grow exponentially.
* Announced partnership this week that they were collaborating with Dexcom ($DXCM) on user data dissemination. In a joint press release, the two companies said that users of Livongo's health information platform would be able to sync their data from DexCom's G6 glucose (blood sugar) monitoring system.
* Livongo and health kiosk startup Higi have teamed up for a new program that will bring a Livongo-branded on-stage program to nearly 500 retail pharmacies. Higi has smart health stations at more than 11,000 chain grocery stores and pharmacies sites around the country.

The barrage of bad news continued a week later when 44 state attorneys general alleged that generic drug manufacturers from Teva Pharmaceuticals to Lannett Company to Mylan engaged in a far-reaching price-fixing scheme covering dozens of drug products. 

In the final days of July, investors finally had something to look forward to: Mylan and Pfizer's Upjohn division agreed to combine operations. The idea is that bigger is better when it comes to successfully navigating the headwinds of the generic drug industry. The combined company, which will be called Viatris, is expected to generate pro forma revenue of at least $19 billion in 2020. Now what
For Mylan, the merger with Upjohn is also a rebranding effort, which could help given all of the negative news swirling around the company's current name.

If you are not familiar what CANSLIM is, it is an acronym that investor William O'Neil used to identify the core qualities of super-performer stocks. These are stocks with the potential to become the next Apple, Netflix or Amazon. Perfect for swing trades and longer term positions.

CANSLIM: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/canslim.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/canslim.asp)

**Tesla** is on a **170%** run since June of 2019, driven by all the key chart patterns I like (breakthroughs of resistance on high volume, small pullbacks on low volume)

I wanted to share some quick thoughts on Tesla from the CANSLIM perspective. Below is each letter and how it applies to Tesla.

· C- Current Quarterly Earnings

Tesla's current earnings growth is not great with its most recent quarter EPS % Change of -36% being a prime example. But there are some positives. Last quarter reported an **EPS % Change Surprise of 495% which is huge. Many big runs start with an earnings surprise of over 100% and Tesla's current run could just be the beginning.**

· A- Annual Earnings

Like the quarterly earnings not much positive here. However, Tesla's **3 year Sales Growth Rate is 63%** which could start translating well to earnings soon.

· N- New Highs, New Products

The CANSLIM way is to focus on stocks continually hitting new highs just like Tesla is doing. This means that everyone getting in right now is in the green and there is **no overhead supply holding the stock back**.

Obviously Tesla is making revolutionary products. Its models have brought electric and AI driven vehicles to the consumer market and **every** **new model create waves as we saw from the Cybertruck.** Tesla does not even have to pay for advertising, everyone does that for them on social media

· S- Supply and Demand

You want to be focusing on stocks where the supply is low and full of long term investors. That way when more buyers come in, that drives the price up due to the high demand and little supply. You can see in Tesla's chart the high price spikes after its earnings report on 10/25. These are not retail buyers **these are institutions, hedge funds and banks taking up large stakes in Tesla.** IBD gives Tesla an **Accumulation/Distribution ranking of A+** and **reports a 4% change in Funds owning the stock.** This metric lags the true number and was just increased.

· L- Leader or Laggard

Tesla is Ranked number 2 in its group by IBD, and **its group rank is number 2 out of 197 industry groups**. For CANSLIM its best to focus on the top 20 groups which are leading in the market, so Tesla fits that Bill. The Group also has a relative strength rating of A+. **Tesla is a clear leader among growth stocks.**

· I- Institutional Support

As already mentioned, **Institutions are taking up positions in Tesla**. Always best to follow the smart money and ride in their wake

· M- Market Direction

We are currently in a **confirmed uptrend** and so this is a perfect time to be looking for new investments.

I grew up in the Chicago suburbs, went to normal schools, just read. I’m sharing a legitimate company. It is a penny stock.

About an hour west of Tucson, AZ there is a large in-situ mine called the Gunnison Copper Project. In-situ mining is where they essentially pump acid into the ground, clean it, and extract the copper. Excelsior owns this space and has begun production. Based on research, this style of mining is low capital intensive due to lesser need for labor.

The copper extraction has been approved by the EPA on 12/23/19. Production began on 1/02/2020.  The company is properly financed and has a couple smaller equity stakes with royalties on the copper production. Apparently this is standard in this industry.

75 million in project financing along with secured credit facilities. There is no need for capital. 

They have had little to no revenue as production as it has begun this year. The company is heavily traded in relation to the spot copper price but in the last two weeks, the stock has spiked due to positive news about EPA approvals and production commencing.

Hey all, very new to this so bare with me here...

For simplicity sake I’ll just use round numbers instead of actual prices BUT the other day I went to invest in a stock that was $3 at close, some very positive news came out over night so I wanted to buy in early morning, I went to buy and the premarket value was $5 so that’s what I had to pay. But then when the market opened it was back down to $3 and never actually recovered fully to what I paid so I ended up losing like $2 overall. Not a big deal, and that’s also why I’m investing very small amounts at this point because I just don’t have a full understanding. 

However, this morning I liked the earnings that came out of Delta and have been watching them for a bit so again I wanted to invest in it before the market opened. Previous close was $59 and premarket was $62, so again I had to pay the premarket price but this time when it opened it was actually at the premarket price.

I'm an investor with medium experience. At the moment I am mainly invested in tech stocks, simply because this is a market that I understand quite well.

I'm looking to expand further into financial blue chips and my eye fell on the major credit card companies. All three tickers in the title seem to have consistent growth and dividends and just sokid companies overall.

Now one of the things that interests me most when choosing a specific ticker to invest in is its moat or edge in the market. I was therefore wondering what separates these companies and what makes it so they can thrive side by side in the current market.

I know this question will probably sound naive if you are knowledgeable on these companies. I'm really, honestly looking for a starting point on understanding them better.

I'm new to stocks and purchased a single stock a few months back. It was Beyond Meat and I've paid 75 Euro for it. The last two days had the stock surge and I would currently make a 50% return on it if I was to sell.

I initially read that one should set oneself a goal for when to sell. That was 100% return for me, but I'm fearing that the current high won't stay. I'd rather sell now, and buy more once the share price fell again. But then, greed and the fear of missing out.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Tesla’s (TSLA) stock surged nearly 10% to a record high Monday, breaching $500 per share for the first time ever.

The sharp advance in the electric car-maker’s stock came in the wake of a bullish call from Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch, who bumped his price target on Tesla to $612 a share, up from $385 previously and representing one of the highest on Wall Street.

A primary tenet of Rusch’s bull thesis was rooted in his conviction that Tesla remains well ahead of its competitors in autonomous innovation.",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,467391,public,self,"Tesla has 'key advantage' over other automakers, analyst says",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/eoeisf/tesla_has_key_advantage_over_other_automakers/,all_ads,6,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '-ZlR1ooctqr18pXiyEVoyVd22aK8KWSp9CF2Pzy7Zg8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kg4smZHY1AjYfwq5vPYJ-2tynwctEHlNXMaK_WnxX1g.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b49dc2b7a0201b271cf3ad213dcba06c2e1934', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kg4smZHY1AjYfwq5vPYJ-2tynwctEHlNXMaK_WnxX1g.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db88309080c420f5d8a2f846b8b018f31c0c8120', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kg4smZHY1AjYfwq5vPYJ-2tynwctEHlNXMaK_WnxX1g.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a903a3fd689ee44535fb0e975d16e8ff436ae4f', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kg4smZHY1AjYfwq5vPYJ-2tynwctEHlNXMaK_WnxX1g.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a00825d87c3a85bcc3b982f12bef84f87f7762f', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kg4smZHY1AjYfwq5vPYJ-2tynwctEHlNXMaK_WnxX1g.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72dfcf5b8d10d7e2cf9f955e2ad8cd1c7edee8fe', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kg4smZHY1AjYfwq5vPYJ-2tynwctEHlNXMaK_WnxX1g.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9768552cd731877a4202ac4e9f65c3c2ffdfad', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 3000, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kg4smZHY1AjYfwq5vPYJ-2tynwctEHlNXMaK_WnxX1g.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=82921572e1b43e2a74203996dbd8161a2661cb4c', 'width': 4500}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,

VANCOUVER, Washington, Jan.  13, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **CytoDyn Inc. (OTC.QB: CYDY)**, (“CytoDyn” or the “Company""), a late-stage biotechnology company developing leronlimab (PRO 140), a CCR5 antagonist with the potential for multiple therapeutic indications, announced today that the Company has filed for Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of leronlimab as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).  


The BTD filing is based on data from the first patient in the Company’s mTNBC Phase 1b/2 trial and an additional single-patient trial under an emergency investigational new drug (IND) protocol evaluating leronlimab for the treatment of HER2+ metastatic, stage 4, breast cancer (MBC).

Data from the first patient in the Phase 1b/2 trial showed the patient had no detectable circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or putative metastatic tumor cells in the peripheral blood and additional large reductions in CCR5 expression on cancer-associated cells at 11 weeks of treatment with leronlimab. This patient’s data also demonstrated tumor shrinkage of &gt;20% after just a few weeks of treatment. The data from the patient under the emergency IND protocol with HER2+ metastatic, stage 4, MBC showed no sign of new metastatic spots in the liver, lung and brain during the treatment with leronlimab.

“This strong data confirms the power of leronlimab as a CCR5 inhibitor for patients living with mTNBC, and is clearly replicating early animal study results that demonstrated 98% elimination of metastases,” said Bruce Patterson, M.D., chief executive officer and founder of IncellDx, a diagnostic partner of CytoDyn, and an advisor to CytoDyn. “Our collective team of key opinion leaders believes that all patients with similar cancers in regards to CCR5 expression may also benefit from the use of leronlimab, including melanoma, brain, throat, lung, stomach, breast, ovarian, uterine, pancreatic, bladder, and thyroid cancer patients. We also believe the mechanism of action for leronlimab may have potential indications in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, polymyolitis, Crohn’s disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome and psoriasis.”

Nader Pourhassan, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of CytoDyn, added: “In the early stages of these clinical trials, we are seeing remarkable improvements in patients living with metastatic breast cancer, a deadly disease that requires imminent new treatment options. We now have several different types of cancer patients reaching out to us to be treated with leronlimab under both the expanded access program, and the Right to Try Act. Currently, we have 4 patients enrolled (2 in the Phase 1b/2 mTNBC trial and 2 under the emergency IND protocol (expanded access program).  Our thought leaders believe that leronlimab may have the potential to treat over 20 different cancer indications and at least 10 autoimmune diseases, including graft versus host disease (GvHD) and NASH.  Based on the number of indications we intend to pursue, we believe we have one of the broadest platform technologies in biotech and are extremely excited to accelerate development of future indications. CytoDyn has been cleared by the FDA to proceed with its Phase 2 trials for both GvHD and NASH. Today’s announcement ushers in a new phase in our corporate history, as we anticipate dramatically increasing the patient population we can help.  We look forward to working with the FDA and continuing to provide additional data that further supports leronlimab as a potential treatment option for patients.”",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,467259,public,self,CytoDyn Files for Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA for the Use of Leronlimab for the Treatment of Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/eobnrt/cytodyn_files_for_breakthrough_therapy/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

To lose all my money in a contract a stock should drop below 9.5% approximately, but i think this is unlikely to happen.

I calculated that after a month(a month is considered 20 days bc 5 trading days a week) with an averaged down growth of 2.2% a day i should have 502euros.

Here are the expected values of my portfolio after given amounts of time:

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to a Wall Street rebound this morning that would erase most of Friday’s losses, ahead of this week’s signing of a U.S.-China phase one trade deal. The major averages set record intraday highs early in Friday’s session, with the Dow topping 29,000 for the first time, but then slid the rest of the day to finish lower. Nonetheless, the S&amp;P 500 has posted weekly gains in six of the past seven weeks, while the Nasdaq is up for five straight weeks. (CNBC)
* U.S.-China trade war taking a toll, but a minor one: Much of economy unscathed (WSJ)
* No major economic reports are due today, but three Fed officials are set to make public appearances during trading hours: Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Meanwhile, no earnings reports are on today’s calendar. (CNBC)
* Boeing’s (BA) new Chief Executive David Calhoun assumes the job today as the U.S. planemaker battles to recover from two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes that killed 346 people in five months and led to the model’s worldwide grounding in March. Calhoun was named CEO in December after the board stripped Dennis Muilenburg of the title. (Reuters)
* Mnuchin: Boeing 737 Max crisis could slow US growth by a half point in 2020 (CNBC)
* President Donald Trump authorized the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani seven months ago if Iran’s increased aggression resulted in the death of an American, NBC News reported. The presidential directive in June came with the condition that Trump would have final sign-off on any specific operation to kill Soleimani, officials said.
* Defense Secretary Esper ‘didn’t see’ specific evidence of Trump claim that Iran planned embassy attacks (CNBC)
* Trump expressed solidarity with Iranian protesters as they took to the streets of Tehran over the weekend, after the Islamic Republic admitted it accidentally shot down a Ukraine-bound airliner, killing all 176 people on board the Boeing aircraft. Trump also warned the Iranian government that the “world is watching.
* Iran denies shooting at protesters amid fury over downing of passenger plane (Reuters)
* The U.S. has reportedly reached out to North Korea to restart diplomatic talks that stalled last October. Washington wants to get negotiations with Pyongyang “back on track” and implement leader Kim Jong Un’s “commitment” to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, White House national security advisor Robert O’Brien told Axios. (CNBC)
* Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was endorsed by veteran Iowa Congressman Dave Loebsack, just three weeks before the party’s nominating contest begins in Iowa on Feb. 3. Sen. Bernie Sanders gained the support of an influential labor union in New Hampshire, which holds the second primary contest. (Reuters)
* Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II is set to hold talks today with Prince Harry for the first time since he and his wife, Meghan, unveiled their controversial plan to walk away from royal roles, a dramatic family summit meant to chart a future course for the couple. Harry and Meghan announced last week they wanted to “step back” as senior royals. (AP)
* Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa is looking for a female “life partner” to accompany him on Space X’s maiden tourist voyage to the Moon. Meanwhile, Maezawa is due to announce which of his Twitter followers will receive a share of the $9 million he promised to give away as part of a social experiment. (BBC and CNBC’s Make It)

The best way to state my question is to give an example.

Let’s say stock is trading at $50. I want to sell a put. So anything under $50 is ITM and anything above $50 is OTM. The higher the strike price I choose the more I pocket because the lower the chance of it being OTM meaning a higher premium. 

That’s logic is correct, right?

What I don’t get is when I sell a contract ITM am I’m essentially gambling that I won’t be assigned? Gambling that the stock price shoots up and renders the option worthless? Because selling put options currently OTM have low credit premiums and seems useless but selling a put option that’s a tad ITM has 3x the return. Also if I sell an option I receive the credit immediately right? So if assigned I still keep premium?

ABSTRACT: By employing leverage to gain more exposure to stocks when young, individuals can achieve better diversification across time. Using stock data going back to 1871, we show that buying stock on margin when young combined with more conservative investments when older stochastically dominates standard investment strategies?both traditional life-cycle investments and 100%-stock investments. The expected retirement wealth is 90% higher compared to life-cycle funds and 19% higher compared to 100% stock investments. The expected gain would allow workers to retire almost six years earlier or extend their standard of living during retirement by 27 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Some key things to discuss (in my view): 

&amp;#x200B;

\- We're taking young investors only. If you are retiring in 10 years I'm sure you'd delever.

&amp;#x200B;

\- There are ways to leverage that don't involve borrowing money. Example: SSO. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Do daily balancing costs offset the gains? The article above gives a clear explanation of why they DONT. If you think they do (which is a very reasonable position), tell us where these authors make a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

\- There's a huge psychological element. There's sure to be a 25% crash in the next 20 years. Seeing your entire retirement go down 75% might be a reason not to do this. However, let's suppose you ARE psychologically ready.

# **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market’s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market’s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events — the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.
*****
&gt; The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.
*****
&gt; Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.
*****
&gt; “I think earnings are going to be a good component,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Companies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we’ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won’t be as bad as it could have been. It won’ be strong. We’ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.”
*****
&gt; According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.
*****
&gt; Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran’s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.
*****
&gt; The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.
*****
&gt; “If the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there’s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises” it could be negative, Arone said. “There’s skepticism already. If there’s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.”
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. “I think they’ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,” he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.
*****
&gt;# Economy
&gt; Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; “The holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,” said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.
*****
&gt; There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed’s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.
*****
&gt; LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. “It seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,” said LaVorgna.

# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years

&gt; Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&amp;P 500’s performance during January’s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&amp;P 500’s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar track records since 1999.

# 378 Days since Last 10% S&amp;P 500 Correction &amp; Still Counting

&gt; There is little doubt that 2019 was a good year for the market. DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&amp;P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&amp;P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).

# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events

&gt; It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.

&gt; As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we’ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.

&gt; “No doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&amp;P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.

&gt; A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.

# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&amp;SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.

&gt; Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader’s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we’ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.

&gt; We did some research and found that when S&amp;P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&amp;P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn’t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.

&gt; “Should you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don’t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year—like 2020—the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren’t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.

# ""Take my crude, please""

&gt; Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**

&gt; When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.

# Dow 29,000?

&gt; By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.

&gt; The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.

Unlike growth stocks, dividend stocks typically don’t offer dramatic price appreciation, but they do provide investors with a steady stream of income.

This type of strategy can bode well for investors in a much riskier year ahead grappling with Middle East unrest and a U.S. presidential election.

Wall Street market analysts largely see much more modest returns in 2020 following a historic run last year. The average year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 comes to 3,345, a measly 2% gain.

Despite the lofty levels, a number of the releases identified some cheaply priced value opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks**

On Thursday **PVH Corp** $PVH (the owner of global brands including Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein) announced a new regional president for its fast growing Asian business and raised its guidance saying it now expects full year EPS of at least $9.45 (compared to its prior view for $9.43 to $9.45).  Not a huge increase, but with the stock down 25% from year highs and trading on a TTM PE of 11.8 it looks cheap compared to peers such as Tapestry (14.7x), Ralph Lauren (20.9x) and VF Corp (29.5x).

&amp;#x200B;

**Stage Stores Inc** $SSI, the rural department store operator, dropped 10% on Friday after a remarkable run up in the stock over the past two months. It follows a difficult period for the retailer as the company’s profitability had been affected by the retail apocalypse.  To offset negative trends it had recently begun transitioning a number of its stores to an off-price model in an attempt to boost margins.  

However, in September the company announced the decision to transition all 783 stores to the off price model by the end of 2020.  A clear signal that the transition was going well.  Subsequently, Q3 figures in November reported comps up 17% (with the 89 converted stores revenues growing 40%). 

That’s a remarkable improvement.  CEO Michael Glazer said on the November 21st earnings call;

*“I want to share with you the incredible excitement that is going on here at Stage Stores. We are absolutely thrilled with our third quarter results. And on nearly every key financial metric, the third quarter of 2019 was a record setting.”* 

The stock price has rocketed after touching a low of $0.55 during the year, but is still only a third of the price it traded for in 2015.  That still looks cheap with a market cap of just $250 million compared to trailing sales of $1.6 billion and full year EBITDA guidance of $37.5 million.  Importantly, with the remaining 90% of stores on target for transitioning by Q3, there is a real potential for the company to increase revenues significantly leveraging fixed costs and boosting margins.

&amp;#x200B;

On Wednesday, strip club operator **RCI Holdings** $RICK reported sales up 10.1% to a record $47.8 Million with same store sales also increasing 0.7%. However it did little for the stock which was down 5% on the year and down 20% from this years highs.  “Highs” may not be the best word for RCI which is trading on just 11.5x trailing earnings and just 7.6x current year estimates.  

The company has been hit by dissatisfaction regarding governance that has resulted in the resignation of its auditor and a formal investigation by the SEC into related party transactions.  That’s the type of news no investor wants to hear.  However, for investors that accept that strip club industry executives are not always the same as your typical Wall Street executive then the current valuation looks attractive. RCI Hospitality enjoys high growth, high margins, strong cash flows, and a regulatory moat that protects its business and profits.  The industry remains highly fragmented and there is a huge potential for growth through acquisitions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth Stocks**

**SmileDirectClub** $SDC announced on Monday that it was launching a new line of oral care available exclusively at Walmart. That is good news but surely the bigger story is that this $4 billion company is disrupting a huge market. 

It is estimated that there are 124 million potential orthodontic customers in the U.S. and half a billion worldwide. That's a total addressable market of $245 billion in the U.S. and $700 billion in the rest of the world. That is a global TAM of $945 billion with SmileDirectClub's current market cap amounting to a tiny fraction of that.

The company is high risk and speculative.  It faces challenges from the dental lobby, state regulators and a class action suit.  However when considered against the huge potential opportunity and cheap valuation, it looks like a tempting gamble. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also on Monday **Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico** $PAC reported passenger traffic increase of 11.4% for December.  Nothing new there.  Mexican air travel is a growth industry and PAC is the leading Mexican airport operator with diverse operations in strategic locations.  PAC has recently agreed its 5 year development plan with the Mexican government including healthy rates and no meaningful changes to capital expenditures. That takes away some uncertainty and the stock has risen 36% this year.  Trading on 18.1x next year’s forecast earnings, with favorable long term trends, it still looks very reasonably priced.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pharmaceuticals**

I**ntra-Cellular Therapies** $ITCI dropped after reporting a public offering on Wednesday that would dilute existing shareholders by 21%.  That’s larger than expected but shareholders shouldn’t really complain.  The stock soared before Christmas after the company reported FDA approval on Monday for Caplyta (lumateperone) for treating schizophrenia. Intra-Cellular Therapies expects to launch Caplyta at the end of the first quarter of 2020 making it the first commercialized asset of Intra-Cellular Therapies.

The stock is up 100% over the past year with a market capitalization of $1.6 billion but that looks reasonable compared to a TAM of $7 billion.  Additionally ITCI is expected to seek approval for other neurological diseases, including treatments for Alzheimer's, depression, and bipolar disorder.  That would open up a potential $25 billion market for Calypta. 

&amp;#x200B;

SMBC Nikko initiated its coverage of **Dermira** $DERM with Outperform rating and $21 (39% upside) price target. Dermira has tripled since October when the company published positive results from a mid-stage clinical trial for its new eczema treatment, lebrikizumab. 44% of patients treated with lebrikizumab exhibited 90% skin clearance. Thats similar to recently launched eczema treatment Dupixent. However, unlike Dupixent, lebrikizumab also proved to be effective at reducing chronic itching (pruritus) which is often a significant issue for eczema sufferers. It also had less of an impact on the immune system.

Dermira received a $1.1 billion bid from Ely Lily on Friday that looks low.  There are nearly 7 million eczema sufferers in the US with currently untreatable conditions and the total addressable market for Dermira is estimated at $5 billion. Given its commercial advantages, regarding pruritus, Dermira should take a significant share of this if it can successfully transition from Phase 3 trials to FDA approval.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast to Dermira, **Sorrento Therapeutics** $SRNE jumped 40% to $4.76 on Friday after receiving a non-binding bid from a private equity fund for $7.00.  

Sorrento has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $763 million (after the recent increase).

The $7 bid follows two bids in December between $3-$5 which Sorrento immediately declined saying “the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.""  The $7 bid, binding or not, suggests other parties may very well agree.  Either way, management clearly think the company’s value is well in excess of Friday’s close at $4.76 and, with all their insider knowledge, they probably know more than most.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insider buying**

Both the President and CEO of **Hersha Hospitality Trust** $HT picked up around $400,000 of stock on Tuesday.  Hersha is a small hospitality REIT focusing on quality hotels in ""gateway cities"" clustered on both coasts of the U.S.  The two executives already had significant holdings but it’s a vote of confidence in the business after a difficult period competing with Airbnb that has seen the stock price fall 50% over the past five years.     

In a November interview CEO Jay Shah said the company will be benefiting from some tailwinds in 2020 as a number of properties that were closed from hurricane Irma have now reopened and that Miami is forecast to be a top growth market in 2020.  When asked about the competition from Airbnb, Shah said that many municipalities are cracking down on illegal rooms with additional regulations resulting in some markets seeing Airbnb rentals fall by up to 50%. 

Hersha’s stock price is down 23% over the past year.  Its trading at a 40% discount to book value with an 8% dividend yield and payout ratio of just 55% of AFFO.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally**

An article in Fool.com on Wednesday highlighted **Valens GroWorks** $VLNCF as one of the top marijuana stocks to buy.  A rare combination of revenue growth of 200% (expected in 2020) with a forward PE of just 8.0. 

Valens processes cannabis and hemp biomass to produce the resins, distillates, concentrates, and targeted cannabinoids being used in edibles, infused beverages, and topicals.  That puts Valens right in the middle of some of the hottest trends in cannabis. Its customers include all of the main Canadian cannabis producers, including Canopy Growth, HEXO, Organigram, and Tilray with most being tied into multi year contracts.

Cannabis extracts, edibles, and non-edible derivatives could generate Canadian sales of close to $6 billion by 2025 according to projections from Ernst &amp; Young.  While the potential for international growth also exists, especially in the US, Europe, Latin America and Australia.

With a market cap of just $400 million, Valens looks like a bargain.

Not stocks like Patriot one, Canadian drones, uranium bulk shipping etc which have made me loose just as much as I've gained But Might get back.

But then his principle #4 is that you can't see the future by looking in the rear view mirror (more common sense). Hmmm... so am I supposed to believe principle #2 or should I ignore it and make my own conclusions with regards to stocks vs. bonds? 

I got really pissed off when he spent almost all of chapter 2 talking about how he and all those other super rich investors would spend a week each year claiming the economy was under attack and withering away while all those journalists, photographers, and videographers were capturing their every word. Meanwhile they were actually pumping millions of dollars into stocks contrary to what their public worries were. Seems very unethical and quite frankly, fucked up.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Assume a married couple has $1.25 million or more in stocks, earning at least 8% annually.

I’m aware there were so complications with growing, rough patches with regulations, and distribution issues. Do these companies stand a chance in recovering in the long term, 20-30 years? I have a significant % of my portfolio in some of these and am eager to buy more to decrease my cost basis. I’m not sure if this is false hope and avoiding coming to terms with me loosing so much money or if I genuinely believe in these companies and how many users there will be in the coming decades.

I am a health tech writer doing some research for a story on biotech ETFs that invest heavily or preferentially in genomics and genetics stocks. I´m interested to hear if anyone wants to share their insights and experiences investing in such funds. The benefits are more or less obvious (high potential, rapid growth of the industry), but how to they compare to the risks? Are there any considerable risks when investing in genomics ETFs such as ARKG and GNOM? What are some things to watch out for when considering putting your money in such funds? What level of risk appetite do they require? And what does active management of genomics ETFs really mean?

&gt; ***Hi r/stocks! I am just putting out next week's most anticipated earnings calendar a day earlier than usual due to not being able to get around to do this tomorrow or this weekend. I really don't like to post these up any earlier than Friday's because sometimes the calendars can look a bit wonky where you might see some companies on the calendar that are actually not scheduled to report, or are reporting on another day, etc etc. but unfortunately I don't really have much of an option here...it's either putting this up now or no earnings thread at all for next week. Anyway, please do me this favor everyone and review carefully the companies that are scheduled to report on their respective days for next week. Admittedly, I did not get a chance to confirm all the companies that are on this week's calendar are actually reporting, but if you see something that doesn't look right, as far as a company that is listed up on this calendar on a particular day that isn't expected to report, please just post a little notice in this thread so that everyone is made aware of it! I'd greatly appreciate that. It's very possible that there are some company logos on this calendar that are misplaced here. FWIW, I do not create these calendars. These are coming straight from EW (Earnings Whispers). Thank you!***

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/09/dow-indicated-at-record-trump-war-powers-vote-and-tesla-new-high.html)

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to more gains on Wall Street after Wednesday’s turnaround that saw the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq log new intraday highs. The Nasdaq also closed at a new high, and indications this morning point to the Dow joining the record run on an easing of fears about a possible escalation of U.S.-Iran hostilities. The projected gains for the Dow would be enough for it to set a new intraday high at the open. It needs a little less than 128 points. (CNBC)
* On today’s economic calendar, the Labor Department is out with its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Additionally, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard all have public appearances today. (CNBC)
* Lighting company Acuity Brands (AYI) is among the few companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while home builder KB Home (KBH) and lubricant producer WD-40 (WDFC) issue numbers after the closing bell.
* For the first time, Tesla’s (TSLA) stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). The electric car maker’s stock jumped nearly 5% on Wednesday, closing at a record $492.14 per share and elevating its market capitalization to almost $89 billion, or $2 billion larger than the sum of GM’s and Ford’s respective market caps of $50 billion and $37 billion. (Reuters)
* The House will vote today on a resolution to curb President Donald Trump’s power to take military action against Iran. Nancy Pelosi said some members of Congress have “serious, urgent concerns” about Trump’s strategy, which the administration did not assuage with a briefing or its “insufficient” notification of the strike to Congress under the War Powers Act. (CNBC)
* Trump pulls back from more military action in Iran crisis, promises new sanctions (Reuters)
* GOP Sen. Mike Lee: Iran briefing from Trump administration was ‘insulting and demeaning’ (USA Today)
* Two rockets reportedly hit the Green Zone in Iraq’s capital of Baghdad, a day after Iran launched missiles at bases housing U.S. and other coalition forces in Iraq. The rockets were fired several hours after Trump declared that Iran appeared to be standing down from military conflict with the U.S. (CNBC)
* A Ukrainian International Airlines plane that crashed shortly after leaving Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, was reportedly on fire before impact, according to Iran’s civil aviation authority. The plane’s trajectory indicated it strayed from its route and was on its way back to a nearby airport at the time of the crash. (CNBC)
* Here are the unanswered questions about the deadly plane crash in Iran (CNBC)
* China’s Vice Premier Liu He, head of the country’s negotiation team in China-U.S. trade talks, will sign a “Phase One” deal in Washington next week. No version of the text has been made public, and Chinese officials have yet to publicly commit to key points such as increasing imports of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over two years. (Reuters)
* A federal appeals court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with plans to use billions of dollars in military construction money to build a long-promised wall along the border with Mexico. (WSJ)
* Following a secretive escape last week from Japan to Lebanon, former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn publicly defended himself Wednesday against accusations of financial misconduct and misuse of corporate resources. Ghosn adamantly denied all charges against him and defended his decision to become an international fugitive by fleeing Japan as a necessity to receive a fair trial and “escape injustice.” (CNBC)
* Lebanese investigators finish questioning Ghosn, file referred to prosecutor: judicial source (Reuters)
* Ghosn regrets not accepting US offer to lead GM for double his salary (CNBC)
* Fugitive former Nissan exec feared he would ‘die in Japan’ if he didn’t escape (CNBC)
* China’s popular video sharing app TikTok had “multiple” security vulnerabilities, said cybersecurity firm Check Point. It found flaws that could allow hackers to take control of TikTok accounts and manipulate the content, upload and delete videos and reveal personal information such as a private email address. (CNBC)
* Twitter (TWTR) said it will test new features early this year that would allow users to control who can reply to their tweets, as it looks to limit abuse and harassment on the platform. Social media firms are under pressure to address harassment on their services. (Reuters)
* Facebook’s final word on political ads: No changes to microtargeting but more control for users (NBC News)
* Verizon Communications (VZ) is eliminating traditional cable bundles and the handcuffs that often came with them, making it easier for households to switch video packages in the hopes they won’t cut the cord entirely. (WSJ)
* Accolade, a start-up that helps workers navigate their health benefits and dealings with insurance companies, has hired banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to advise ahead of a possible initial public offering, CNBC reported. The company is expected to file later this year.
* Australian authorities urged another mass evacuation across the heavily populated southeast today as a return of hot weather fanned huge bushfires threatening several towns and communities. Thousands have been made homeless and thousands have had to evacuate repeatedly because of the volatility of the fires. (Reuters)
* Many Puerto Ricans slept outside and woke up to an island still largely without power after a string of earthquakes rocked their home in recent days. The worst quake, a magnitude 6.4 that struck early Tuesday, killed at least one person, injured at least nine. (USA Today)

TSLA also develops and sells solar panels/roofs and batteries(not sure it sells batteries), idk much about that actually.

I have difficulty guessing when and why the stock will have this adjustment.

Right now I'm owning TSLA for speculation and plan to hold it until next Friday, and the buy it again after the adjustment as an actual investment and profit form the company's growth.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking into investing in CD Projekt red and looking for some key metrics there. Since I want to calculate them myself, I'm struggling to find and interpret the Data on their balance sheet. Apparently, they use different terminology in their financial reports. That's why I'm struggling to find the right Data and evaluating it.

&amp;#x200B;

For example,  the true Market Cap.

&amp;#x200B;

Market cap - (balance sheet cash : debt) = True market Cap

Number of shares x current market price of one share = Market Cap 

&amp;#x200B;

The Numbers I Found are:

Number of shares = 96 120 000

Current Market Price of one share = 257,30PLN

As of the end of September 2019 Cash, equivalents, and bank deposits = 593 629PLN

Debt = no outstanding debt under any credit or loan agreements = 0

Market cap = 96 120 000 x 257,30 = 24.731.676.000

True market cap = 96 120 000 - (593 629 : 0)  = 95.526.371‬

&amp;#x200B;

Second CD Project RED has a current PE Ratio of 261.24. Is that good? In what range should a good PE and forward PE Ratio be or what does it depend on if a PE Ratio is good or bad?

&amp;#x200B;

I would be really glad if you could help me interpret the data or suggest a book, YouTube channel or something that helps me to interpret the data better. And second, do all companies use different financial terminology in their Reports?

Lynch talks about ""Earnings"", but I found out that there are companies with modest revenue growth but with important EPS growth or Profit Growth. For example AIRBUS ([https://app.stockopedia.com/share-prices/airbus-se-EPA:AIR](https://app.stockopedia.com/share-prices/airbus-se-EPA:AIR)).

In the airbus example, the earning growth are very modest, 2% year, but the actual EPS and Profit growth are sensibly higher.

I did my research on the company a long time ago and have been investing for months. It has gotten better and better with time, they're in ""facility building mode"" around the world, basically. Profits above $10 million are forecasted a couple of months from now. They just posted over $1 million profit for the past fiscal quarter. It is expected to keep increasing after that as they open the buildings that they're constructing worldwide. Unique company, unique tech, the only company in the world capable of such production for a particular product of much higher quality than all of their competitors. Lots of potential partners, with some signed already. Lots of potential products and research that has been made by their own team of scientists and they basically sell those product ideas and formulas to client companies. The client companies start producing them as if they are their own idea, basically.

I invested a small amount of money initially. I have ""share recycled"" my way from hundreds of shares bought initially with my own money to over 10,000 shares, most of which I didn't contribute a dime to. I saw a rollercoaster effect in the market on a weekly basis and memorized it for that company. It was like clockwork and I became darned good at predicting it. I'm still doing it to this day and hoping to get to 50K or more shares. I do about 2 trades per week in a Roth IRA via Fidelity. When I see the price spike up about 6-8 cents to what I feel is the ""max"" it will reach given the current waiting status, I sell. I wait for it to drop down to the regular weekly low about 6-8 cents lower than that and I buy back at a much lower price. As the price rises again, I gain money. I can usually gain a good bit by selling. 

For instance, 10,000 shares x .06 cent increase in the stock for the week. I see it and sell. That's $600 of increase that I've old, basically. I do active trading, so I do about one sell and one buy every week or so. It takes 2-3 days sometimes for the cash to post and be available again. Perfectly okay with this method. I buy back when it drops down to x amount, about $0.06 lower. Because of the number shares, that buys about another 2,100 shares. The number of shares that I gain with each trade and the balance itself will of course increase with each trade. Eventually it will be like 5,000 or 10,000 shares gained with each recycle.

Of course, I can't do this forever. But there's an internet forum for that company's stock. Everyone else seems to have bought in at a higher price and just dug in their feet at that price, leaving it. Then they're buying it more on top of that at a similar or higher price. When I posted my share numbers and the low price that I bought it for, they all seem shocked and did the, ""Man, you're going to make some big bucks!"" thing.  I want to take it to 50,000 shares or 100,000 if I can get it up there quickly enough, then stop and wait. When it goes up to the much higher dollar amounts (people are predicting $10 to $20 a share and it may very well hit that and go above it in a year or two), I want to pull out and move half of that money over into a target retirement fund or other safe place to grow a little and yet remain more stable than all stocks. The other half I want to put into a total stock market index fund for growth and move a little at a time over to the more stable fund as it grows with time so that too much isn't in to stocks.

What are your thoughts on this share recycling method? Apparently no taxes get paid on gains in Roth IRAs. I like that. I don't want to do day trading too quickly, anyway. So am I overlooking anything?

Of course, I can reason that something could go wrong. The company could tank and I could lose most or all of it. I'll take that risk. Also, I could sell all shares during one of the half recycles and the share price could shoot up one day and cause me to have to buy back in at a much higher price and therefore have a lot less shares. I'm willing to take that risk to keep bumping up share numbers. It seems to greatly outweigh that if it grows as fast as other investors in it seem to think it will.

So...my question is more so, ""Why aren't they doing this?""  Is there anything else in the background that I need to know about share recycling? Why do I seem to be doing better than what appear to be seasoned investors?

It is opening facilities worldwide and about to start full-time production later this year when they're all open. The company is doing this to be able to provide worldwide volume once they start production and basically not hit any snags due to being overwhelmed.

I feel extremely confident in the company and have done thorough research for months. I strongly feel that this company is going to blow up when everything opens. Customers are already waiting for products, partnerships have been signed, patents have been acquired, licenses have been put in for already and approved, etc. Very unique company with technology and methods that far surpass their competitors who really aren't competitors because they can't produce similar products. A couple of months from now, their efforts so far will be released and profits are estimated at over $10 million. Future estimates after that keep going up and will only increase because I'm familiar with the demand and partner companies.

This is a hobby investment that has turned more serious for me once I saw the potential. I am in the USA and use a Roth IRA (Fidelity) to do the trade. I do active trading, so it is more so the ""sell and wait 2-3 days to clear"" type of deal before buying again. I'm not in a hurry to trade like a stock market broker and I'm perfectly fine with this method. As I understand it, there also aren't any taxes on the gains in a Roth IRA, which is another reason why I like it. So I don't have to keep up with that stuff.

It is an OTC trade. I got that many shares at pretty low prices. I researched and watched the stocks of the company for months before initially investing, then I invested a certain amount. It wasn't all that much. When I saw the weekly trend of it averaging an up-and-down 6 to 8 cent variation per week, I basically started selling when it went up 6-8 cents and then letting the money in the Roth IRA clear and buying back days (or a week or whatever time) when it dropped down as much as I have seen it drop before. Then I would buy back in, gain about 500-600 shares in that single buy and wait for it to climb up another 6-8 cents again, then sell again. Repeating the ""sell when high, buy when low"" strategy. 

I literally started with hundreds of shares and have turned that into 10,000 shares with very little of my own money. The other money came from selling when high and buying back when low. Now, will this method always work? No. I can think of two scenarios. One, the price of course could drop (and for any company, for that matter - risk is always there in investing) and not go back up and I could lose my money. The company could tank for some reason, even when appearing to do well, and I could lose it that way.

The second way...the company could surge in price during one of the times when I've sold when it was high and the price could climb much higher and the company could take off. Yes, I'd lose some money, but could easily just go all-in again.

**Now here's my question in all of this**:  Is there anything that I'm missing from this scenario? Clearly, my balance has increase positively from doing this and I have a lot of shares in the company. The company seems to be doing really well. I'm asking if there's anything that I *don't know of* in regards to the back-and-forth trading that I'm doing as active trading. Are there any unforeseen stipulations that I'm overlooking? Of course, as the amount of shares increases and the balance increases, every time that I do a sell-and-buy trade like that, the amount of shares continues to climb. When I first started out, I gained hundreds of shares per trade. Now I gain thousands more shares simply using that same method. A lot of people seem to call this method ""share recycling"" and I see some investors in the company (I monitor a major online forum for investors in the company) who are just buying in at x price and not even doing any of that. They're just buying more and more, even if the price keeps climbing, but not recycling any. I have a lot more shares than they do, of course.

So...are they just really overlooking this opportunity or am I missing something? I commented my number of shares on the forum and the low price that I bought in at and I got some comments that said, ""You're going to make some big bucks!"" from a lot of people who couldn't believe the number of shares and the super low price from where I sold when it was higher and then went all-in one day when it hit its lowest point of the year before rebounding.

So I have about $90k sitting in an account doing nothing. What if I took $20k of it and bought 10 shares of Amazon. Let’s say these are purchased via a buy order at slightly less than they’re trading for currently. For the purposes of this example, let’s assume it’s trading for $2,010/share and I put in a limit order of 10 shares for $2,000. They’re purchased as the price goes through the daily fluctuations and I immediately put in a sell order for 1% higher than what I paid. These are (relatively) quickly sold and I net $200 less whatever I owe for taxes. 


This seems like its too good to be true, so what am I missing? As long as I didn’t purchase right after an abnormal spike, is it not reasonable to think it wouldn’t fluctuate at least 1% higher within a day or two, max?

I'm new to stocks but I have a question. When comparing companies that pay out dividends quarterly to those who do yearly and reinvesting them, I came to the conclusion that yearly dividends seem more advantageous. One side of me understands that my maths are wrong but the other side cant seem to find the mistake. Please enlighten me.

It goes as this:

Lets say company X has a 6% yearly dividend yield.

Case 1: Yearly payment. 
If we invest $12000 ($1000 per month) at the end of the year we would receive 12000*0.06 which = $720, putting us at $12720.

Case 2: Quarterly payment. 
Same thing, invest $3000 ($1000 per month) and at the end of the first quarter receiving $3000*0.015=$45 putting us at $3045. Next quarter we add another $3000, standing at 6045 and getting 6045*0.015=$90.67 putting us at $6135.67. Third quarter comes around and again we add $3000. From that we get $9135.67*0.015=$137.03 in dividends. Add that to our total and we are at $9272.7. And the last quarter is the same story, add $3000 = $12272.7 and from that we get $12272.7*0.015 = $184.09. Overall this adds up to $12456.8 compared to $12720. 

If we continued the same way for several years the difference would increase.

Please provide some kind of mathematical explanation or any other way of understanding this because i cant seem to be able to work it out.

I do not work for BP, I have never worked for BP, my understanding and interest come from being an Alaskan and I have worked in the Alaskan north slope oilfield.  I am not an insider.  I DO have a position in BPT.  The information provided comes from my first-hand account, publicly available information including the 10Q &amp; 10K reports.

**Current State &amp; Some Context of the Acquisition:** 

Hilcorp is currently in the process of acquiring the BP Alaska subsidiary from BP America (BP PLC).  The formal acquisition completion date is up in the air: it could be as early as April or as late as December.

BP Alaska has a number of leases on the north slope of Alaska, one of which is the Prudhoe Bay Unit which has shared ownership with other oil companies -- BP Alaska is actually the minority shareholder at \~26%.  The BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust pays a royalty based on the oil production from the Prudhoe Bay Unit alone.  Hilcorp is buying ALL of BP Alaska and therefore absorbing the share of the Prudhoe Bay Unit.  Hilcorp has a reputation of improving production in older, depleting oil fields.

**The Opportunity:** We do not know what will come about with BPT.

From my understanding there are a number of scenarios that will play out.

**Scenario 1:** BP America will continue to pay royalties from the oil Hilcorp produces from Prudhoe Bay.  Hilcorp is not obligated to. 

*From 10K “BP Alaska may sell or transfer all or part of its working interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit, although such a transfer will not relieve BP of its responsibility to ensure that BP Alaska’s payment obligations with respect to the Royalty Interest and under the Trust Agreement and the Conveyance are performed. BP will be released from its obligation under the Support Agreement upon the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of BP Alaska’s working interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit if the transferee \[Hilcorp\] agrees in writing to assume and be bound by BP’s obligation under the Support Agreement. The transferee’s agreement to assume BP’s obligations must be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the transferee must be an entity having a rating of its unsecured, unsupported long-term debt of at least A3 from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a rating of at least A- from Standard &amp; Poor’s, or an equivalent rating from at least one nationally-recognized statistical rating organization (after giving effect to the sale or transfer and the assumption of all of BP Alaska’s obligations under the Conveyance and all of BP’s obligations under the Support Agreement).*

**Scenario 2**: Hilcorp agrees to the Support Agreement and pays the royalties until the trust is terminated.a.	The Trust will terminate if either (a) holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Units vote to terminate the Trust or b.	the net revenues from the Royalty Interest for two successive years are less than $1,000,000 per year (unless the net revenues during the two-year period have been materially and adversely affected by certain extraordinary events).

**Discussion**: Royalty distributions for the last four quarters was $35 Million.  I think we’re far from 1 million mark, especially if Hilcorp is successful with their value proposition of improving production.

**If either Scenario 1 or 2** is the case, Hilcorp’s value prop is to extend the life of depeted fields, they are very efficient in doing well workovers and there is also a couple of coil rigs on the slope that are faster and will likely result in a production boost.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 3:** Hilcorp or BP Alaska (or BP America) buys up enough open market shares to close the trust. OR They buy up a significant amount of shares, lobbies for support and puts it up to a vote.

**Discussion:** We’re at \~5x the trading volume in the last two days compared to the 3-month average.  Someone is buying a lot of shares, and I’m hard pressed to believe Warren Buffett is going long.  I’m also hard pressed to believe now there is some institutional investor that’s caught wind of the deal.. the news has been out for months. I also doubt the volume pickup is strictly due to Friday’s trust distribution announcement.

Hilcorp certainly doesn’t want to pay the royalties, especially if they’re not obligated to! And, BP America certainly doesn’t want to pay royalties for a field they’re not getting any money from!  I theorize one of these operators is making a move to scoop up shares on the open market to his 60% share ownership needed to close the trust.  Hilcorp is spending $5.6 Billion on the deal.  Certainly, they expect the Prudhoe Bay unit to perform.

Please share your thoughts, tell me what I’m missing.  I will wait and see what happens here, per the SEC.  Anyone taking a &gt;5% share must disclose within 10 days, so we’ll soon see what happens.  I’m keeping a close eye on volume during the next couple of weeks..

&amp;#x200B;

*Theres also this tidbit: “Upon termination of the Trust, BP Alaska will have an option to purchase the Royalty Interest at a price equal to the greater of* 

*(i) the fair market value of the Trust property as set forth in an opinion of an investment banking firm, commercial banking firm or other entity qualified to give an opinion as to the fair market value of the assets of the Trust, or*

*(ii) the number of outstanding Units multiplied by (a) the closing price of Units on the day of termination of the Trust on the stock exchange on which the Units are listed, or (b) if the Units are not listed on any stock exchange but are traded in the over-the-counter market, the closing bid price on the day of termination of the Trust as quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market.* 

*If BP Alaska does not exercise its option, the Trustee will sell the Trust property on terms and conditions approved by the vote of holders of 60% of the outstanding Units, unless the Trustee determines that it is not practicable to submit the matter to a vote of the Unit holders and the sale is made at a price at least equal to the fair market value of the Trust property as set forth in the opinion of the investment banking firm, commercial banking firm or other entity mentioned above and on terms and conditions deemed commercially reasonable by that firm.*  ***(what the hell does that entail, seems pretty subjective... is this their get out of jail free card?)***",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,463686,public,self,BPT - Hilcorp Acquisition of BP Alaska - BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/elpubl/bpt_hilcorp_acquisition_of_bp_alaska_bp_prudhoe/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

I'm 26 and I didn't start investing until the beginning of 2018, my parents are Asian immigrants and have never invested in stocks and think they're akin to gambling especially after the recession. I say this to emphasize how little I knew of stocks and the fact that it was frowned upon. I made IRA contributions in 2016 and 2017 but just let it sit in money markets collecting less than 2% interest, stupid I know. In the beginning of 2018 I decided I wanted give investing a chance with approximately $12k. I read a handful of Warren Buffet quotes and thought I was ready. 

Fast forward to December 2018 and my portfolio was **down 25%**. My $20k of contributions was only worth $14k, I literally lost an entire year of contributions. I felt like my parents were right and I was an absolute idiot for wasting not only my time but my hard earned money playing with the stock market. On the news and even reddit people were talking about how the market was going into another recession. I was super depressed and just stopped looking at my account all together. I even came here and posted on 12/21/18 how defeated I felt. *Be greedy when others are fearful,* perhaps the Oracle of Omaha's most famous and cliche quote. I couldn't stop hearing it in my head so in January 2019 I decided to double down on my picks and invested my entire $6k contribution. 

I'm really happy to say that a year later today my portfolio is **up 41%** and worth $44k on $26k invested. A lot of this is definitely due to luck but if I did not push myself to buy this time last year my portfolio would be barely break-even today.

The app for practicing was Stock market trading sim app

I  bought $100K worth of INPX at .50 not too long after it turned down and  I was down -40 to 60k on it and I figured this might happen but I held  onto it because for some reason I thought it might go past 5.00 and it  did not long after I bought it

on the app I sold it at $6.81 so I'm at 1.3 Million starting from $100K

I've heard penny stocks are a scam or an easy way to lose all your investment

Can someone give me any advice because if that was a real $100k I would have just profited 1.2M

I get what I did was unusual and risky and it even seemed I had quickly lost half of my investment \[ 50k \] but I held onto it because I strongly expected it to go up in value and it did 

Are penny stocks scams? Or just very high risk high reward? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can I make money off penny stocks for real? I want to hit 10 million dollars and semi retire but I also have other plans to make much more then that but I want my first taste of financial freedom to be gained from investing in stocks 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a big fan of gambling and I tend to be a good gambler and get lucky

I also prefer high risk high reward

And I have a goal of 10 million dollars starting from 100k-1 million

I have a talent that can generate me enough to get that starting amount but it requires some degree of luck and a bit help in completing the other part of it

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm in love with the fact that things can happen so quickly that said I don't obsessively monitor the price very often I tend to buy on my app and check it whenever I feel like it which I know isn't good and I would change somethings if it was real money

I'm still very new and I want to become good  and hit my 10 million goal

If that was a real 100,000$ I would be at 1.3 million now and would be smart enough to back off and just earn interest from that and then keep reinvesting what I could afford to

I also have a talent that can be used to generate 100K or more but it requires some degree of luck and I have to be very creative in that moment..... I'm working on generating money now and debating if I should use 100k or 200k if I end up generating 200k 

Oh Also I like to minimize the type of stocks to few and am in some cases very willing to dump all my money in 1 stock which is actually what lead me to now having 1.3 Million starting from 100K buying INPX at .5 and selling at 6.81",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,463555,public,self,Trading SIM Experience big profit need help,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/eln1vc/trading_sim_experience_big_profit_need_help/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

Faulty thinking?  Place stop loss orders on all my stocks?  None of them?

What’s your feedback?  I have learned a lot from this sub and am grateful to learn from your collective experiences. I actually only recently learned about stop-loss orders from this sub. 

One hesitation I have is that if I cashed out in November or December 2018, I know I would not have bought back in at the right time and would not be sitting on my current gains. I just have a feeling this time will be worse because global uncertainty is worse today than it was in November / December 2018, IMO. I wasn’t investing during the 2008-2009 storm.

Brokerage account sitting mostly in cash except for a handful of godawful stocks like SQ, APRN, and F that somehow went down instead of climbing 50% like everything else. 

I even thought about buying TSLA the day that the window broke during the truck demo. But nope, I chickened out and now it's on its way to $500. I sold AAPL back at $220 in 2018 thinking it'd never see those highs again. Whoops again.

Then, to add insult to injury, I somehow felt the need somehow to buy into a bunch of positions today, thinking that I've missed out on way too much action. And now, ladies and gentlemen, there's war with Iran.

The bank has 8.53% deposit market share for their area with deposit growth of 2% from June to September of this year. 

Stockyard's fundamentals look strong and seem to outperform industry averages.  They sport an operating margin of 38% compared to industry average 25% and a profit margin of 31% in comparison to industry average of 19%.  Their debt to assets are low despite recently acquiring King Bank Corp and they've raised their dividend the last three years. 

The bank's P/E is 13.1 but it's been growing at a steady rate.  Net income for the first 9 months of '19 grew by 21% and management forecasts that continued growth will come from market share gains related to their core loan pipeline and deposit base. 

One thing that gives me pause is that management seems to be selling shares of the company on regular intervals however the Board of Directors has moved in the other direction and unwaveringly purchased shares. I don't know what could explain this pattern of insider transactions.

Still, the bank's beat earning expectations the last three quarters and I'm going to take a small position.  I'm linking the Q3 numbers and the finviz profile showing the insider patterns.  If you're taking your own look and see something I missed let me know.

MSFT is up from 100 dollars a share to 160.  That's roughly a 60% increase in price. Why? What has Microsoft done differently or what justifies the 60% increase in its price. 

APPL is up nearly 100% this year, why?  It is my understanding that it is losing cellphone market shares to android phones and their laptops aren't doing too well either.  Do the pods, and all of the other okayish services it is offering justify a nearly 100% increase in its stock price?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

May:

July/Aug:
NASDAQ: 6.26% Contraction

Sept./Oct.:
NASDAQ: 4.80% Contraction

The DOW was similar although a bit less due to less exposure to Tech and thus China and most of these contractions centred around US/China trade and Trump tweets. All other contractions that I can see (and I’m literally using apple Stocks with two fingers here so if someone can give a better analysis please do) are less than 3%.

I'm kinda new to the game and am having a few stock ideas for 2020. Would like to know yours too. Currently, I'm looking at these few stocks for the following reasons. 

1. Tesla - Tesla had just successfully ramped its Model 3 production in the US to achieve 86,000+ units in Q4. It has achieved record delivery numbers quarter after quarter since Q3 2018 (with exception to Q1 2019). Now with a new factory completed tooled up for 2020, am expecting further increase in productions and delivery numbers if economic conditions stays the same. Estimating the stock to surpass $500 before the end of the year. Thou, the buy in may be a bit too high right now.  
2. Disney - I have just started following this stock for the past month and had little idea of what's coming for it. However, there's a lot of chatter about its new streaming service Disney+. New contents like The Mandalorian had definitely drove sign ups and more contents based on Marvel (WandaVision &amp; The Falcon and Winder Soldier) that are coming in 2020 is definitely an encouraging sign. The service, however, is yet to proof if it can surpass Netflix in terms of contents. The buy in seems to be reasonable (assuming it has yet to fully price in Disney+) but there's some risks attached. 
3. AMD - Had once owned the stock before it rallied in 2018. From what I've read so far, a lot of the stock's momentum seemed to be driven by the Ryzen chips, which is now widely believed to be the industry leader. There's also some talks that Apple may consider the change from Intel to using AMD's CPU's in the far future. More research is definitely needed to justify the current price to buy in. May need your opinion on this as well. 

Feel free to add your stock ideas in the comments as well but be sure to add your reasons and justifications for the price too. Otherwise, it wouldn't be much of an idea to discuss about.

His view is that what has driven valuations up in equity markets are low interest rates. This makes sense because low interest rates make equities relatively more attractive v. debt and means you're willing to settle for a lower free cash flow yield - i.e. higher valuation. If interest rates go up, equity markets should get crushed. What would make interest rates go up? Inflation. What would cause inflation? Wage growth resulting from the extremely tight labor market in the US.

Been a long time lurker and a novice, but actively learning, investor.

They are a small cap company with a market cap of **356.28M** and Enterprise Value of **1.07B** ...isn't that a rather *major* red flag? That means that their debt is outrageously higher than what the are valued at? That alone gave me pause. 

My second major concern was that their forward P/E ratio was **-1.48**. Isn't that a pretty giant catastrophic red flag as well? Wouldn't that translate into a perceived *loss* in value for the next 12 months?  


After looking further into their fundamentals they look like an absolutely rubbish choice, so i'm wondering if I'm missing anything? Is it just hype?

Today's up volume is very strong and investors are planning on more volatility in the oil sector. $OILU is an equal-weighted, 3x leveraged, passively managed commodity ETF with the benchmark index of Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Index. A 3X ETF is sometimes used for swing and day trading as investors try to scalp short term moves. Our trade is only 14 days and it is possible that the situation regarding oil will remain questionable and volatile for that short period of time. The investment is affordable and the return is attractive for an adventurous investor. 
For every 100 shares at $23.29 we can Sell to Open 1 Call, strike $23, price $1.51, expiring Jan 17, 2020. Our breakeven and net cost of shares will be $21.78 with downside protection of 6.5%.

If a company does go public, there is an initial raise of capital with the sale of shares/IPO but that’s about it right? If the company has to raise more money they would have to do a stock split which decreases the relative value of the company. 
Further, besides the stock price tracking the relative health of a company, there isn’t necessarily an advantage or disadvantage of relative stock price fluctuation for the company right? Meaning, beyond the initial money raised from the IPO, the stock price movement doesn’t necessarily change the cash position of a company right?

This is my first post on reddit, so a mandatory WAZZZZAAAUPPPPP is neccesary here.

I would like to know how long a call stock option takes before the stock is in my account ready to be traded. This is just a theoretical question, I currently have no stock options, but lets say I wanted to buy APPL for instance, and I bought a call for apple at a SP of $100 and then the stock increases to MKT $120. I want to be able to exercise that call and buy the stock at $100 then turn around and sell it for $120 and cap that $10 profit before the mkt price falls again. How long does it take for the stock option to be exercised and the stock in my account ready to be traded? I am also using Fidelity, Etrade, really whatever platform how the lowest turn time (remeber, theoretical question).

Also *PLEASE* do not lecture me on how ""nobody ever exercises option"" or ""Why would you exercise it, just sell it"". I understand what I am doing, and once again, this is just a theoretical quesiton.
