## [Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder](https://www.bookdepository.com/Antifragile-Nassim-Nicholas-Taleb/9780812979688?ref=0611)

While Taleb’s previous two books—Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan—focused on overconfidence and underestimation of risk, Antifragile is the antidote on how we can reduce fragility and in the process, gain from disorder and randomness.

Antifragile provides a view that doing something supposedly harmful (not too much) can be beneficial. Here are some examples:

* An adequate amount of stress is productive.
* A controlled, localized forest burning reduces the chance of a full-scale firestorm.
* Some physical activities such as weight training increase old people’s lifespan. 
* Exposing the body to a deadly virus like Measles can acquire life-long immunity.
* Allowing big banks to collapse is healthy for the overall financial system.

This concept is widely applicable to both lives in general and in investing. The rule of thumb is you want to make more antifragile decisions and avoid decisions that increase fragility. A simple way to find out if a decision will do more harm in the long-term—makes you fragile—is to ask what happens when randomness is high. ",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,367156,public,confidence,self,Best Books I Read Last Year,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fsqsh0/best_books_i_read_last_year/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Normal Day?
 
Late Selloff
No Real Features
 
 
Today was as close to a normal day as any I’ve seen in the last 6 weeks.  Futures were all over the place last night and opened to the downside this morning but before 10:00 we were back on the upside banging against the 2,640 level for the fourth day in a row.  Support around 2,575 seems to be present and we rallied off it several times.  However, today’s pickup to a slight new high for the week and closing on the low of the day leads me to the conclusion that we are running out of steam.  This week’s range is a meager 95 S&amp;P points, and the Friday close of $2,541 may be an important number.  If we go no higher and get back into last week’s range (2191 to 2637) we can head back towards the area of a necessary, test of the current bottom (and I use that term with extreme caution).  

The volume continues to shrink daily, with the absence of the normal “end of quarter” rebalancing trading.  Market internals were just okay with NYSE losers with a slight edge and NASDAQ 1:1. Volume was average for an average day, as were treasury prices.  Most of the economic numbers are pre-COVID-19 and I think useless.  The DJIA was considerably weaker than the market with 25 down and only 5 up.  The only big (?) gainer was CAT on the news that the Great Orange might suspend or delay tariff charges, and it was up only $29 DPs.  This has become an incredibly hard market to trade since the IV has become so extreme that if you want to trade an SPY position (as I did today) in order to make even a short-term trade the option prices are so absurd as to skew the risk to unreasonable levels.  The example today was a simple one.  At a price on the SPY around $259.50, the SPY 4/8 240 puts were $3.30…that’s a week from tomorrow, and $20 out of the money, for $3.30.If for any reason, volatility subsides, these thing will lose a major piece of its premium.  If you’re right, and it happens fast, great, however, if it takes more than a day or two, to get started, or moves up, even though it’s not what I expect, it just withers away.
 
Our “open forum” on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It’s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we’ve grown to almost 800 members.
 
 
SECTORS: Other names in the news: Since it’s late, I’m going right to two of my favorite topics:
Today’s Disaster Du Jour was Amarin Corp (AMRN), a biotech that got an unfavorable ruling on patent litigation related to a potential generic version of Vascepa.  The company said it will not affect worldwide patent protection.  The stock received several downgrades from Oppenheimer, Goldman, and Stifel, and after closing $13.58 yesterday, it opened $4.22 and finished the day $4.00 -9.58 (70.54%)
 
On the upside we had two winners with Vivus (VVUS) introducing a remote monitoring platform for use when there is Social Distancing.  VVUS is a long way down from its highs in the last decade but came to life today and after closing $ .95 yesterday with an open of $4.00 and finished the day $3.60 +2.65 (279%).
 
But the HOMERUN OF THE DAY goes to SGBX, maker of modular units for easy and quick construction received a MOU from Transcend Onsite Care to use their technology for container-based modules for medical care.  After closing on Monday @ $2.06, it opened $3.80, traded $9.74 and closed $9.30 +7.24 (351.46%) before continuing higher in late trading hitting $12.75 and is currently $10.35.
 
BIOPHARMA: was MIXED with TEVA the big winner @ 8.87 +.36 (4.23%), REGN +13.90 (2.94%), VRTX +6.03 (2.06%) and LABU -1.09 (4.72%), and IBB $106.35 -2.;49 (2.29%),
 
CANNABIS: This group was MIXED CRON -.69 (10.88%) the biggest loser, while CURLF -.22 (5.3%) and MJ $11.40 -.15 (1.3%).
 
DEFENSE: was LOWER with RTN -10.23 (7.24%), UTX -4.25 (4.32%), NOC -12.73 (4.06%) and ITA $142.90-4.67 (3.16%).
 
RETAIL was LOWER with the group down across the board.  M -.53 (9.87%), JWN -.69 (4.37%), KSS -1.60 (9.98%), DDS -4.23 (10.27%), WMT -2.00, TGT -3.68 (3.83%), TJX -1.33 (2.8%), RL -4.75 (6.68%), UAA -.51 (5.33%), LULU -6.56 (3.38%), TPR -.27, CPRI -.50 and XRT $29.78 -.24 (.80%).
 
FAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL +.69, AMZN -25.95, AAPL -4.21, FB -1.20, NFLX +1.04, NVDA -6.09, TSLA +13.37, BABA +.23, BIDU +1.05, BA -5.78, CAT +3.49, DIS -4.30 (4.31%) and XLK $79.48 -2.42 (2.95%).
 
FINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -7.12 (4.45%), JPM -4.75 (5.08%), BAC -1.07 (4.85%), MS -1.51 (4.33%), C -2.63 (6.57%), PNC -6.37 (6.31%), AIG -1.81 -1.81, TRV -5..59 (5.45%), AXP -6.14 (6.8%) and XLF $20.82 -.59 (2.76%).
 
 
OIL, $20.48 +.39. The stocks were MIXED even with the price of Oil trading higher. NBL was the big winner +.58 (10.92%), DNR -.18 (8.5%), and XLE $28.72+.10 (.35%).
 
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,596.60 -46.60 After the recent gains, Gold has failed to break through the highs around $1700 and have fallen back.  I will reassess and look for a new entry point.
 
BITCOIN: closed $6475 + 95. We traded in another short range again today and finished mid-range on the day. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.12 +.07 today.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

First off, I hope everyone is doing well during these trying times. 

Secondly, I am a young/new investor. I just started trading in the stock market because someone told me it would be a good idea with the crash. I recently lost my job due to COVID19 and am looking to find different sources of income. Plus, I start college in August and would ideally like to learn the stock market and Forex trading. I have downloaded the robinhood app and invested 100$ in various penny stocks. I am not looking to invest too much money (30-100 every month more if I can afford it). Ideally, I’d like to have a mixture of long term (5 or more years) and short term (5 or less years) stocks. 

Can somebody please explain the stock market in more detail? When is the best time to invest? What’s the best companies to invest in? How to make money etc.  Or just give me general advice? Is there a certain YouTube channel/book you find helpful? Any success with certain stocks? I’m very curious to pick your brains.

The swing trading strategy I am going to share with you has produced a 815% return on 48 trades since 2-10-2010. It makes 22.31% on average when it is correct, -3.93% when it is wrong and works 37.5% of the time. I encourage discussion but please read my explanation +watch the accompanying video before jumping to conclusions. This is a back-tested strategy as you will see. The SPY during this same period returned 140%.

Leveraged ETFs are very useful for day/short term traders as they increase the volatility of the underlying equity.

Most people agree however that they are not suitable for long term investors due to high fees and volatility drag (decay). These are certainly things to think about if you decided to use these instruments.

Volatility drag is the biggest issue as many people point out. For instance if you had 50 days straight of alternating +5% and -5% moves in the etf, at the end of the streak you would be left with 93.9% of your initial money, and a 6% loss is quit manageable. However if during the same streak you had your money in a 3x leveraged etf with +15% and -15% moves, you would be left with only an abysmal 56.6% of your initial cash.

This is because losses work geometrically against you,  consider the following

3% loss needs a 3.09% gain to reach breakeven

5% loss needs a 5.26% gain to reach breakeven

10% loss needs a 11.11% gain to reach breakeven

20% loss needs a 25% gain to reach breakeven

25% loss needs a 33.33% gain to reach breakeven

30% loss needs a **42.85%** gain to reach breakeven

40% loss needs a **66.66% gain** to reach breakeven

50% loss needs a **100% gain** to reach breakeven

This is why it is so important to not fall in love with a stock. Even if you are a long term investor have a line in the sand where you will sell. Otherwise you are not compounding your money, you are compounding your losses. 

I bring this up to say that a successful leveraged ETF strategy needs to take advantage of the upside possibilities while ruthlessly cutting losses if the trend breaks. The goal is to have an excellent gain to loss ratio of over 3:1. With this a strategy’s break even point is a 25% success rate meaning you can be right only a quarter of the time. The actual strategy has a p/l ratio of 5.67 and a success rate of 37.5% meaning it works extremely well.

The strategy is this:

Create 6 short term daily EMAs, color them red, find the minimum of them

Create 6 longer term daily EMAs color them blue, find their maximum

Enter when the all the reds are first over the blues with a 3% stop loss. Sell when the stop loss is hit or any red EMA crosses below a blue.

That’s it, and you will find this is an excellent way of timing the market and visualizing its trend.

I have created a python back testing program to test different length EMAs, different stop losses, adding a SMA restriction…

You can try it for yourself here: [https://repl.it/@RichardMoglenMo/RWB-with-Stop-loss](https://repl.it/@RichardMoglenMo/RWB-with-Stop-loss)

1. Run the program by hitting the green arrow, it will have to download some libraries

2. Enter the Ticket Symbol you want to test- I use TQQQ

3. Enter the Start date of the test- I use 1/1/2010 

4. Enter Six Short term red emas- I use 5,6,8,10,12,15 

5. Enter Six longer term blue emas- I use 30,35,40,45,50,60

6. If you want a simple moving average restriction enter a period (So it will only enter if the current price is over that moving average) Otherwise enter 0-I use 0

7. Enter a stop loss % I use 3%

8. Press enter

My suggestions yield a return of 815% in about 10 years which would turn a 10k initial investment into 91.5k. It also outputs some key statistics such as max gain, max loss and holding periods.

I use this strategy with a portion of my portfolio as it outperforms almost every individual stock pick during uptrends (defined as when the red emas are above blue emas in the index etfs QQQ, SPY)

I still am in a way cause I know this economy cannot sustain itself through the coronavirus. But stocks will still go up...

With infinite QE, wouldn't hyperinflation be inevitable once the coronavirus is no more? More money means things will cost more due to inflation. Stocks are currently being inflated and will only get more inflated until you eventually walk into a McDonald's and a burger costs you $300. This causes increase in revenue for McDonald's which means $MCD stock keeps going up and will maintain a higher price.

With Donald Trump's love to keep pushing the market to all time highs every week, $SPY will keep going up. If you had unlimited money and you wanted to invest your money, you would buy stocks now that they are low. Stocks keep pumping higher and higher. I feel like this is happening with all the banks and companies that are using the Fed's 0% interest rates and infinite QE to get ahead of the game.

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

### 1) Dynex Capital Inc ([$DX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/dx/)) - Insider Purchases

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/dx/):

&gt;Dynex Capital, Inc., a mortgage real estate investment trust, invests in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on a leveraged basis in the United States.

Dynamix was seeing some nice growth at the beginning of the year, but have fallen 41% to a price of $11.84 since reaching their high of $20.17 on February 20th.

Their [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=826675&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) activity shows a whole bunch of executives and directors purchasing stock over the last few days.

Digging deeper into the purchases we can see that there are some sizable purchases in both dollar amounts and percentage sizes. We also see that some of the purchases were preferred stock purchases.

Dynex does have [ownership requirements](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/826675/000082667519000019/a2019definitiveproxy.htm) that require directors to hold 3x their retainer fee in stock, the CEO to hold 5x their salary in stock, and the other specified executives to hold 3x their salary in stock. 

Before the market crashed, all of the directors and executives were well above their ownership guidelines. The market crash pushed the CEO and EVP below their threshold, but their purchases did not put them back over the threshold (they have until December 31, 2020, to reach the threshold).

### 2) SITE Centers Corp ([$SITC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/sitc/)) - Insider Purchases

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/sitc/):

&gt;SITE Centers is an owner and manager of open-air shopping centers that provide a highly-compelling shopping experience and merchandise mix for retail partners and consumers

The start of 2020 has been rough for SITE. They entered 2020 with a stock price near $12.75 and then saw it fall 55% to its closing price of $5.67 on March 20th.


The recent [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=894315&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) activity shows their CEO, CFO, and a Director making purchases on the open market. The CEO made a sizable $568,000 worth of purchases while the Director and CFO increased their positions by 11% and 23% respectively.

2020-03-19|Terrance Ahern|Director|P-Purchase|Common Shares|$3.96|$106.9K|27.0K|263.2K|11%

The individual Form 4 [forms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000120919120020345/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) show that there was no explanation given for the purchases, so we can assume these were not part of some pre-arranged plan.

SITE has [ownership requirements](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000119312519094528/d662101ddef14a.htm) requiring the CEO to own 5x their salary in stocks, the COO and CFO to hold 3x their salaries, and the Directors to own 5x their cash retainers.

Before the market crash, all of the executives were above the stock ownership thresholds (except for the CFO who recently became CFO and has until March 31, 2025, to meet the requirement). The market crash put the CEO well below his ownership requirement and his purchases did not put him back over the requirement.

*\* Mr. Fennerty’s salary was not present in the most recent Proxy Statement because he just recently became CFO, so we just used the old CFO’s salary for this table\**

----|--------------|-----|----|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|
2020-03-19|David Lukes|CEO|$2.1M|$4.3M|-$2114.2K

2020-03-19|Terrance Ahern|Director|$1.5M|$250.0K|$1.2M

SITE has 4 executives that must file their trades publicly, and we only see the CEO and CFO making open market purchases. This is obviously less compelling than if all 4 executives were to have made purchases, but the CEO paying over $500,000 to increase his holding by over 40% is still noteworthy.

### 3) Chimera Investment Corp ([$CIM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim/)) - Insider Purchases

We wrote about Chimera last week, but they recently amended their Form 4s to clarify that what they previously said were stock grants were actually purchases by the executives and directors.

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim/):

&gt;Chimera Investment Corporation operates as a real estate investment trust in the United States. The company, through its subsidiaries, invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities secured by pools of commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and other real estate related securities

Chimera was on a slight upward trajectory during the beginning of the year before falling 58% from their high of $22.98 to their closing price on March 20th of $9.55.

Their [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1409493&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) activity shows that all of their executives (and one director) made purchases (with 4 of the 5 executives making sizable six-figure purchases) on March 18th.

Looking at the CEO’s individual [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000115752320000382/xslF345X03/form4.xml), we see that these were in fact open market purchases and not stock grants as was originally reported. The Form 4 also does not mention that these purchases are part of any pre-arranged plans.

The [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000120677419001325/cim3506171-def14a.htm) verifies that Chimera does have ownership guidelines for the executives and directors that require the CEO to own 5x their annual salary in stock, the other named executives to own 3x their salary, and the directors to own 5x their annual cash retainer.

Even with the almost 60% stock decline, all of the executives and the director that purchased stock are well above their required holding threshold (except the Chief Legal Officer).

Any time you have all of the executives making purchases in the open market when the stock price is at its low point, it is worth paying attention to.

### 4) Carpenter Technology Corporation ([$CRS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/crs/)) - Insider Purchasing

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/crs/):

&gt;Carpenter Technology Corporation manufactures, fabricates, and distributes specialty metals worldwide. It operates through two segments, Specialty Alloys Operations and Performance Engineered Products. The company offers specialty alloys, including titanium alloys, powder metals, stainless steels, alloy steels, and tool steels, as well as drilling tools, and metal powders and parts.

Carpenter Tech has been having a rough start to the year before ultimately crashing a whopping 70% to their low of $14.87 at close on March 20th.

The [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=17843&amp;owner=exclude&amp;action=getcompany&amp;Find=Search) activity shows some purchasing activity by 3 of the their executives and 1 of their Directors. Not the most compelling purchasing activity as only 3 of the 5 executives made purchases and most of the purchases weren’t huge, but the General Counsel did purchase $220,000 worth of stock increasing his shares by 49%. 

Date|Executive Name|Title|Type|Stock Type|Avg Price|Total Purchased|# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase

2020-03-18|Tony Thene|CEO|P-Purchase|Common|$17.72|$97.5K|5.5K|164.1K|3%
2020-03-18|Brian Malloy|Chief Commercial Officer|P-Purchase|Common|$17.63|$52.9K|3.0K|30.5K|11%
2020-03-10|Robert McMaster|Director|P-Purchase|Common|$28.05|$42.1K|1.5K|5.1K|42%

The individual Form 4 [forms](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=17843&amp;owner=exclude&amp;action=getcompany&amp;Find=Search) do not give any explanation for these purchases, so it is safe to assume these purchases are not for any pre-arranged plans.

The [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/17843/000119312519246588/d791270ddef14a.htm) tells us that Carpenter Tech has stock ownership guidelines that require the CEO to own 5x their base salary in stock, the SVPs to own 3x their base salaries, and the VPs to own 2x their base salaries.

Before the market crash, all of the executives were well above their required ownership amount, but the crash put everyone well below their requirements and none of their purchasing activity has pushed them over the requirement.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 31st, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/31/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-31-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open Tuesday, the final day of the turbulent first quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3% on Monday — up over 20% from its coronavirus sell-off low hit on March 23 but still off 24.5% from last month’s record high. The 10-year Treasury yield moved higher early Tuesday but remained around 0.7%. U.S. oil prices were bouncing more than 5% early Tuesday after falling below $20 per barrel to an 18-year low and finishing the New York session just above that level Monday. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in phone call Monday, agreed to talks to stabilize energy markets. China’s official purchasing managers’ index for March showed an expansion instead of an expected contraction. However, Chinese officials warned against reading too much into the numbers because February’s outbreak halt was so severe.

*****

&gt; * Wall Street closes the books Tuesday on the worst month since the financial crisis, when the Dow sank 14% in October 2008, and the worst quarter since Q4 1987, a three-month period that included the October “Black Monday” stock market crash. The fourth quarter in 1987 saw the Dow plunge 25.3%. This year, heading into the final trading day in March, the Dow was losing more than 12% for the month and nearly 22% for the first quarter as the coronavirus crisis bought the U.S. economy to a virtual halt. The S&amp;P 500 was faring marginally better than the Dow, off 11% in March, the worst since a nearly 17% drop in October 2008. The S&amp;P 500′s 18.7% decline with one day left in the quarter was the worst three-month period since Q4 2008, when the index lost almost 22.6%.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases surged past 788,500 with 37,877 deaths and nearly 160,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The U.S. remained the country with the most known cases — over 164,600. The U.S. death toll of 3,170 as of Tuesday morning was 139 below fatalities in China, where the outbreak started in December. The most deaths from the virus and the second most infections were in Italy, which saw 11,591 deaths among more than 101,700 cases. Spain has the third most cases at about 88,000 and the second highest death toll at 7,716. China has the fourth most cases at over 82,240 and the third most deaths at 3,309.

*****

&gt; * The USNS Comfort floating hospital ship was docked in New York City after arriving Monday morning with the goal of taking noncoronavirus patients within 24 hours. The arrival of the Comfort attracted crowds, with many seeing the ship as a symbol of hope. But the onlookers also raised questions around social distancing.The Comfort’s mission was to help take the strain off New York hospitals, which have been overwhelmed by coronavirus cases. Temporary hospitals have been set up in New York’s Javits Convention Center and in Central Park. The Comfort’s sister ship, the USNS Mercy, has been serving noncoronavirus cases in Los Angeles since Sunday.

*****

&gt; * Amazon has fired a New York warehouse worker who organized a strike to demand what he sees as the greater need for coronavirus protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant at the fulfillment center known as JFK8 on the city’s Staten Island, told CNBC on Monday he was fired to keep him quiet. Amazon said Smalls was fired after he received “multiple warnings” for violating social distancing guidelines and refusing to remain quarantined after coming into close contact with an associate who tested positive for the virus. The organizers said at least 50 people joined Monday’s walkout. Amazon said that number was more like 15. The JKF8 facility employs about 4,500 people.

On TD, after clicking on the call or put you want to buy, you move the slider close to the bid and close the lock. The lock guarantees you'll either get your price or not get filled. You cannot get filled at another price which typically will be higher if you enter a trade with your limit order unlocked.

Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated it would take 18 months to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Here is an update on the progress of several major companies, in their search for a cure.

**Moderna Inc.**

On Jan. 23, Moderna received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, Market Watch reported.

On Feb. 21, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said it would begin enrolling 45 adult patients into a Phase I clinical trial to test mRNA-1273 as a vaccine for COVID-19. The trial is set to end on June 1, 2021.

On Feb. 24, the biotech company said it had shipped the first batch of mRNA-1273 to the NIAID  for clinical trials in the United States.

Patients will be closely monitored for one year.

Demetri Kofinas speaks with Josh Crumb, founder &amp; CEO of Abaxx Technologies, which is launching a new commodity futures exchange in Singapore over the next year. Josh was formerly a macro economist and commodity strategist at Goldman Sachs, where he was the head of metals strategy. He is also a co-founder of gold bullion dealer Goldmoney, and Jewelry company Mene.   

In their conversation, Josh and Demetri discuss a curious case of backwardation on the COMEX, which is the futures and options market for trading metals in New York. The price of gold in near-dated futures expiring at the end of March spiked by almost 10% to $70 an ounce above the price of obtaining physical gold in London.

Demetri Kofinas speaks with George Selgin, director of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute about the recently announced monetary and fiscal policy measures being undertaken to stem the economic fallout from COVID-19 and the government mandated shutdown of the American economy. This is a deep-dive into the specifics of the Federal Reserve and US government’s policies, including the mechanics of the monetary and fiscal stimulus.

We are living in unprecedented times. The closest analogy to what we are experiencing is the mobilization undertaken to fight World War II with one crucial difference: this is a radical demobilization of the American economy. To fight the virus, Americans are being asked to stay in their homes and move about as little as possible. In order to survive a prolonged period of commercial inactivity governments have moved swiftly to pass monetary and fiscal stimulus measures that are themselves as unprecedented as the current lock-down of the global economy. How far will these measures go and what will Western countries like the United States look like on the other side of this crisis?

Hi All,

We have the potential for a ""Follow Through Day"" this week, which is a gain in one of the major indexes of over 1% with volume greater than the previous trading session. This must happen on the 4th day or later of a rally to be eligible. This is a CANSLIM strategy to get you in as close to a potential bottom while minimizing risk.

After a Follow through day you want to slowly scale in to market leaders, stocks showing excellent technical price performance relative to the indexes. At this point any stocks over their 30 and 50 day moving averages and near their prior highs are showing considerable relative strength. This price action suggest that institutions are keeping their large positions in them and potentially buying more.

Here is my focus list for the upcoming trading week:

[$AMD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMD&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$EHTH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24EHTH&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$SAFE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SAFE&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$DOCU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DOCU&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$NVDA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NVDA&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$TAL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TAL&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$NET](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NET&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$TEAM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TEAM&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$CHWY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CHWY&amp;src=cashtag_click)\* [$DXCM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DXCM&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$PLMR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PLMR&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$ZM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ZM&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$GSX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSX&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$TDOC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TDOC&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$COE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24COE&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$FIVN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FIVN&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$RNG](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24RNG&amp;src=cashtag_click)

As the CANSLIM methodology goes, all of these are showing great technical strength as well as Earnings growth, Sales Growth, Margins Growth, ROE... These could be the top performers if the rally holds.

I made a video analyzing each of these stocks, pointing out resistance levels, buy points, entry setups I will use and fundamentals I like.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday’s open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday’s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month’s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.

*****

&gt; * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed’s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.

*****

&gt; * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, “Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.” Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.

*****

&gt; * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York’s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. “Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,” he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy’s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China’s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China’s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world’s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.

*****

&gt; * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.

FED
question we keep asking ourselves is how much the fed can do in order to mitigate the coronavirus, in this case a recession and most likely a depression.


**INTEREST RATES**
interest rates are built to stimulate the growth of the economy. unfortunately we couldn’t see the extent of the fed cut as it was at 2/.5% and now reaching 0/.25%. 
[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/interest-rate-affecting-consumers.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/interest-rate-affecting-consumers.asp)


**BONDS**
buying treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. bed currently has $4.6Trill in assets from buying these since 2008. which has the ability to reduce long term interest rates and lowers mortgage rates(MR are currently down ~-1%.

**LENDER OF LAST RESORT**
makes more money available to financial system to make sure the it can operate smoothly. so FED can lend cash which financial institutions can use them only for short term movements.
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender_of_last_resort](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender_of_last_resort)


**DISCOUNT LANDING** 
FED is able to directly lending money to commercial banks. CBs normally lend from each other. the FED rate however is high and has been on a steep rise since 2016 from 1% to a high of 3%. FED stepped in and lowered rate to .25%. which makes it offers CBs better or at market level rates compared to  if they borrowed from each other.
[https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/discount-window.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/discount-window.htm)


**PAPER FUNDING**
FED can lend cash directly to businesses. short term(day to day activities, payroll etc.)
[https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/reform-cpff.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/reform-cpff.htm)


**SWAP LINES**
FED lends money to the rest of the world. dollar is a currency that holds a lot of weight. make more dollars available at almost lower interest rates.
[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/fed-starts-dollar-swap-lines-with-nine-additional-central-banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/fed-starts-dollar-swap-lines-with-nine-additional-central-banks)

So lets say if you’re not gonna be exercising an option and will just sell the option, and you buy a call option expiring april 17th, wouldn’t it make sense to buy the call option that has the lowest strike price? Since it has the most intrinsic value?


For example, a stock costs $6, wouldn’t it make sense to buy the call option with the lowest strike price? So even if it falls you’ll find a buyer.

All I see are posts either saying it's the end of the world or everything will snap back like a rubber band the moment people are allowed outside of their houses.

Things are changing fast around the globe at the moment so it's hard to keep track of exactly what's what but over a third of the globe is under some kind of lockdown at the moment. In some places it means that people can't go out in public unless it's specifically to get groceries or other urgent product/service while in others it's only a recommendation to stay home as much as possible, and in still other places, the Tide Pods crowd is licking toilet seats. Regardless, a huge part of the financially relevant world are on lockdown and/or (most of)  the citizens are doing their best to practice isolation and social distancing.

As it is, there is nothing on the immediate horizon that promises a cure. A vaccine will take a year or more. Chloroquine needs testing before it can be used and reports of its efficacy are spotty. Even if a miracle were delivered tomorrow morning, people would have to get their hands on it and that takes time. We are probably looking at at least another two to three weeks in the miracle scenario. More likely, we are looking at anywhere from 2-6 months before life even starts to look like normal again if we depend on herd immunity and/or minimizing the virus' circulation.

For argument's sake, let's say it's 3 months until the pandemic threat is removed enough to return to normal life.

So, how does this all play out economically?

During these three months, a lot of people are laid off/unemployed, receiving less than a normal income. Rent/mortgage payments are suspended but piling up the whole time. So are other payments. Cars, internet, etc. Everything that their UI check doesn't cover. At the same time, a whole lot of small businesses will never be able to catch up on the accumulation of debt over that time and will go bust. It's not like we'll just hit play and the world picks up where it left off.

There will be fewer jobs available to return to because of the businesses that went under. People will have less money in their savings accounts to spend on shiny new toys. Those that avoided infection will continue to be scared by it. (No vaccine for another 9-15 months yet.)

So now we have fewer businesses open, more people out of work, less disposable income available for those that did keep their jobs and some people still scared to go out and gather in crowded places. On top of all this is the realization by many the need for a rainy day fund and that ANYTHING can happen. I expect people will want to save more than usual (at least until they forget, which I understand is not very long for most humans, but still. lol)

How anyone can believe the economy snaps back and goes full throttle in that time is beyond my understanding. OTOH, I also don't see how this could spell the end of the world and 1929 all over again.

What I think is likely to happen:

\- people will resume buying the essentials immediately (and things they perceive as essential). Once people are back to their daily grind, they still need gas, they still need to repair their cars, they still need clothes and groceries, etc. They'll go back to eating lunch at McDonald's twice a week and their Starbucks coffees every morning. This stuff will snap back pretty fast. (Which cheap stocks to get into now for that snap back?)

\- new iPhones will have to wait till debt is paid off. So will that new sofa, that new car, etc. These things will take longer but will eventually recover as people forget. (Stocks to avoid for a while?)

\- some things may never recover or take an awful lot longer to forget and require years and years for people to resume. Cruise lines, for example. (Better be willing to wait 10 years plus to reach new highs.)

ABSTRACT: n this paper, we compare the historical performance of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with lump-sum investing (LSI) across three markets: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. On average, we find that an LSI approach has outperformed a DCA approach approximately two-thirds of the time, even when results are adjusted for the higher volatility of a stock/bond portfolio versus cash investments. This finding is consistent with the fact that the returns of stocks and bonds exceeded that of cash over our study period in each of these markets.

This finding is consistent with the fact that the returns of stocks and bonds exceeded that of cash over our study period in each of these markets.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,363663,public,confidence,self,Dollar cost averaging vs lump sum investing.

I have done some initial research and, until now, I believed that news items would first appear on the news agency's website. Then, the first ones to pick up the news (within 1-2 seconds) would be the players that have direct agreements with the news agencies, such as Bloomberg Terminal (whenever a news item is disseminated, the agency would send the item to Bloomberg). This would be followed by any scraping bots that noticed the news item on the website (within 30 seconds) and individual observers (within 5 minutes, albeit they would probably have been alerted by an automated system that got the news before).

However, I have been noticing that those items sometimes appear on the news agency's website up to 30 seconds after the news item's creation timestamp and the underlying security's price had already begun to move accordingly. I do not understand how that is possible, however, since that would imply that news are disseminated to select entities before being made public, violating SEC rules.

I personally have a list of probably 500-1,000 bookmarks I've collected over the years consisting of all kinds of scanners, screeners, research tools, trading software/apps, blogs, books, videos, trading communities, allllll kinds of stuff that am currently filtering through and updating to make a big categorized list of things I use to gather news and make decisions in the markets, and I'm sure many of you have tons of stuff I haven't even heard of. 

On that note, if you have a tool, resource, website, blog, whatever that you find invaluable in your trading/investing activities, please share it and a short description of what it is and how you use it and we'll use this thread as an addendum and include many of the suggestions here in the final post. 

In particular we're looking for stuff categorized into the following categories:

* **BROKERS/TRADING SOFTWARE** (especially those that support international clients)

* **SCANNING/SCREENING/IDEA GENERATION**

* **NEWS RESOURCES**

* **BOOKS**

* **VIDEOS/TUTORIALS ON ""GETTING STARTED""**

* **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS RESOURCES**

* **FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS RESOURCES**

* **SECURITY TYPE-SPECIFIC TOOLS/WEBSITES** (e.g. things useful specifically for options traders, specifically for forex, specifically for equities, etc)

* **BLOGS/READING/RESEARCH MATERIAL**

* **USEFUL TWITTER ACCOUNTS** (Ideally news/info related rather than the typical fintwit pumper/trading service stuff, though some of them can be useful and will be included)

* **ANYTHING ELSE YOU FIND HANDY**

That should be enough to get us started. Not everything in this thread will be included, but I will link to this thread in the final one. In the mean time I am going to go through my own massive list of stuff and try to dig out the best of the best. Looking forward to getting this up soon and hopefully it will be useful!

1. Either a quick recovery once things open back as if nothing happened, most people go back to their old jobs, things continue as they did - or a slow recovery from a recession caused by unemployment, lower spending etc but a recover nonetheless.

2. Complete and total global breakdown of everything and we're back to lunging rocks at each other for a rabbit to eat for dinner. At that point money won't matter so who cares.

Assuming that number 2 doesn't happen, what companies would/are you buying NOW for growth and returns once this is over? Solid companies which regardless of what may come will still have a needed and in-demand product, a loyal customer base, and good fundamentals. These are the stocks that should be invested in right now. I don't care what you say - if you want a working society you will still need mail/delivery, utilities, food and even things like TV and internet at this point in history. This is not going away.

Disney - Solid fanbase, diversified in many industries, can do no wrong in terms of animation/movies (I saw the dung heap that was Frozen 2 and even with terrible pacing/story it managed to be a financial behemoth because the reality is kids eat up Disney). I used to live in Orlando and the government there are on their knees catering to Disney no matter what. Disney has the entire central Florida tourism industry and government under their thumb. The parks literally rake in cash no matter how high the ticket prices go and they reach capacity almost daily. Not to mention Marvel, FOX and STAR WARS. Literally the last company I see going tits up.

2. Amazon - Not much needs to be said. They've become the top online merchant, have a number of other ventures and industries that are successful and buy out successful companies to make them better (Ring etc.). Too bad their shares are so high.

3. Google - Same thing, not much to be said why.

4. Lockheed Martin, possibly Boeing. Both extremely important to the U.S. military and the last thing I see being allowed to fail. I think this situation has shown that the U.S. will literally print money to keep defense industries afloat. However, as shown with GM, that doesn't mean the stock can't become worthless even when bailed out. 

5. 3M  - Think about pretty much anything in your life and chances are 3M plays some sort of role in manufacturing it. Not to mention their role in the production of PPE. It seems there is issues though with how China has taken control of manufacturing facilities in their territory to serve them and not allowing exports which seems to be the main cause of PPE shortage in the U.S. so we'll have to see how that plays out.

I'm sure there's more but those are just off the top of my head. Let's make this a discussion, not a shit-slinging contest.

# **What could be ‘shocker’ economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.
*****
&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.
*****
&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. ”$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.”
*****
&gt; # Sharp recession
&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.
*****
&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.
*****
&gt; “We’re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we’re going to get a clearer picture,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he’s watching the PMI data. “This data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it’s sell first, ask questions later.”
*****
&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.
*****
&gt; “I expect that we’ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don’t think we’re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,” said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.
*****
&gt; # More Fed Artillery
&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.
*****
&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar’s run on Friday.
*****
&gt; As the world’s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is going to be looking for indications that there’s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we’re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,” said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. “I’m watching what’s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.”
*****
&gt; # ‘Liquidity infinity’
&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.
*****
&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed’s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. “Things are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can’t take it anymore,” he said.
*****
&gt; “The amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I’m calling it,” he said. “By the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What’s the good news over the weekend? That they’re going to pass this bill? That’s already in the price.”

# Will the Fed’s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?

&gt; With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it’s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors’ portfolios.

&gt; From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.

&gt; It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it’s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the “money printing.” Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. “The massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve—in concert with fiscal stimulus—surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,” noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed’s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed’s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday’s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets—both stocks and bonds—may be beginning to sniff that out.

*****

# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims

&gt; Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one’s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.

&gt; “The personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “This is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.” Per LPL’s Chart of the Day:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it’s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.

&gt; There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.

&gt; Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We’ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it’s not because they’re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.

# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity

&gt; The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.

&gt; This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&amp;P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82—besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants—both retail investors and institutions—and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.

&gt; We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.

&gt; “In volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren’t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,” noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. “Improving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.”

&gt; At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn’t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.

&gt; Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23—including buying large amounts of corporate bonds—are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank’s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren’t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.

# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market

&gt; The incredible volatility continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?

&gt; “Although market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&amp;P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&amp;P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you’d be down 27% per year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.

# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying

&gt; Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.

&gt; As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.

I have some good news to share with you all this weekend.

I've decided to share with everyone in here my U.S. stock market google spreadsheet for all to copy and download.

This is a real-time stock market data spreadsheet for all of the current U.S. listed stocks.

I've seperated all the tickers by their respective exchanges, simply click on the tab on the bottom of the spreadsheet to pull up all the stocks for each exchange.

This is a pretty ginormous list of stocks so my spreadsheet may be a little laggy to open/load at first run.

Anyway, I thought I would open this up for everyone in this sub to make copies of their own as I know I had gotten quite a few requests from this community over the past couple of weeks to share some of my spreadsheets.

[Here is the direct link to my Google Sheet!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UxMHkwPGIvzbOGwreDgeXw8cRxsQ8CPo5jMLAIoTL6A/edit?usp=sharing)

BTW, here are some of my other spreadsheets I have shared in here over the past couple of weeks but are not currently open for making copies yet.

It was a good intro into the stock market.

Recently however, I have taken an interest in longer-term investing and have read the following books, all of which encourage investors to follow fundamental principles that have been used by famous investors such as Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger (I'm sure everyone has read these books):

-intellegent investor - Benjamin Graham
-rule 1 investing - Phil Town
-payback time - Phil Town 
-modern value investing - Sven Carlin 

I feel I now have a good understanding of the basics of 'value investing' after reading these books and wish to start investing my savings. I'm 28, so should I invest well, I have a good amount of time ahead of me to build my wealth.

Given the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, it appears that the stock market is currently crashing, presenting opportunities to buy stocks at discounted prices.

I'm creating this thread in the hope that other 'value investors' or 'rule one investors' will share and discuss their current stock picks, or stocks that will make good investments for when the market eventually recovers from the COVID-19 lows.

For the past three years, we have had zero or near zero interest rates and trillion dollar annual deficits. Remember when Trump said he ""could get used to"" negative interest rates? We are now in a crisis where aggressive fiscal policy is needed, increasing the federal debt by $2.2 Trillion. We are also officially in a recession and a bear market. 

State and local pension costs will become unmanageable due to zero interest rates and significant losses in the stock and bond markets. State and Federal tax collection will decrease significantly in 2020-2021, leading to huge state and federal budget deficits, forcing another round of quantitative easing and liquidity injections that will dwarf today's $2.2 Trillion in stimulus spending. This is a debt spiral in which monetary policy will ultimately fail to fix. 

On the other hand, significant cuts in state and federal pensions, social security, medicare and other programs is likely to lead to a deep depression as consumer spending collapses.

In this video I go over the change M1 Finance will be implementing and how I feel about it as well as how I feel it could hinder users in the future as well as why I feel they made this move. I also cover the volatile stock market as it continues to bounce around even with over 3.3 Million Jobless Claims this week.  Beside both of those topics I also go over the $2 Trillion Dollar Stimulus Package that has been passed and specific details of the bill that will change how Dividend Investors look at some stocks all together.

I do not by any means agree with Trump that this is a hoax but there is a lot of trickery going on in the numbers. China has half the world's population and only 80,000 cases. We had a month warning on this and have surpassed China in one week. China is reporting zero new case as well. I do understand the seriousness of this but to those in good health it will be like the flu and some will not show symptoms. Those with lung problems and the elderly will drop like flys but that's no different than the flu. This is serious but it's going to disappear like H1N1, Zika Virus, and Ebola did.

I would be focusing on growth stocks with a good dividend payouts. Companies I had in mind would be GM, AT&amp;T, IBM, etc.... 

My reasoning behind this is because since there might be an opportunity to capitalize on this opportunity and I would be dollar cost averaging too. Eventually these big name companies would finally recover and I would be collecting dividends + the growth of the stock over time.

- So let's hold a lot of cash right now and just wait for a lower entry point.

It can't be that easy can it? Why isn't everyone then shorting the market right now with lots of leverage? 

Well, it just isn't that simple. 

- There are SO MANY bull market scenarios where you it doesn't work out like that. We might have 3 months where the market is totally volitale but basically flat (down 5% one day, up 5% the next). We might get some sort of irrational 10% jump when people think they have a cure ready by the end of the year, followed by a 8% drop because of earnings. We might even have a 20% gain followed by another 30% crash.

Here's what I think is likely to happen: One by one the big cities, who each have their own ""curve"" will start to skyrocket in cases. Each new city will cost us dearly in terms of economic, medical and - if things get super bad - social disruptions. It will not be pretty. And all the while, the small towns are one by one getting hit too, especially since they don't seem to be taking the precautions that they should be. ICUs will be filled, ventilators will be occupied and local healthcare systems will be overrun. Doctors will get sick which will make things even worse. This thing will last for months with no end in sight. And I'm not even going to start on the rest of the world (including Brazil and India).

Further, we have no idea how many/ which companies the fed and government will be able to keep afloat. This economic shock is uncharted territory. Even with the fed and congress throwing in the kitchen sink to save corporate America (not saying they shouldn't) we don't really know if it's going to work and to which extent. Companies are already over-leveraged, partly due to low interest rates, but that's another conversation except for the fact that we can't lower interest rates further. We just lowered taxes so there's not that much we can do there either. There is a very good chance that this is prolonged and people will lose their jobs and most companies will at the very best will take hits to their bottom line. 

So how do we avoid this fate? **We close the country.** I don't think that shutting down city by city is going to be productive at this point. We need a coordinated response. If we close the country now, all those cities/towns which are just starting on their ""curve"" will be essentially stamped out and relatively easy to manage within a month. The bigger cities will take more time but will be allowed to peak early. All the while you test like fucking crazy... This allows us to figure out which cities can be opened and when. We restrict movement (I understand this is pretty unamerican but this is serious) and test to the fullest extent of our capability. We will also likely need to ""pause"" debt payments and institute systems to make sure that anybody who needs to be fed is fed - we don't want a revolt. I would try and use already-existing distribution networks (think amazon and walmart) to make sure that people get what they need. One by one we should be able to open cities and towns. The optimist and realist in me thinks that we can be nearly done in probably like 3-4 months and people can get back to work.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,362151,public,confidence,self,Why I'm Bearish,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fq5a5a/why_im_bearish/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seems fun so I'm gonna continue being active here I guess. (I posted on both r/stock and r/investing because they seems the same to me - they should just merge)  


Anyway, I got some questions about  VIX, the volatility index and how to make money from volatility. So listen, you can Google around and ask professional traders - you will learn that trading the VIX is virtually suicidal. If  you made money a couple of times from trading VIX ETP (exchange traded products) like VIXY, SVXY, UVXY and all..don't feel too good. I once made bank from XIV (inverse volatility ETF)  and then poof, it went to zero (google ""XIV blow up""). Lucky for me, I locked in half of the gain. But still... you know. ***Bottom line: avoid playing with VIX ETPs - but hey, we are all a little bit of a gambler right - so good luck brothers.***   


If you are not a gambler, I thought I would share some alternatives on how to profit on /hedge from volatility of the stock market.  


\-/-

**1) Invest in market makers: $VIRT, $MKTX, $FLOW (traded on Euronext), $MKTX**   


Google a bit about market makers. You'll find that these are the people that creates liquidity in the market. The bid/ask spread on your screen on every stocks you see, that exists partly because there are market makers. They make profit by exploiting the ""**bid -ask spread""**. Now,  when volatility is high, the bid-ask spread gets wider, and the trading volume gets highers (more transaction are happening) therefore , market makers will make more money. Think of the bid-ask spread as their fees/commissions for enabling your buy/sell orders to be filled in. Currently I'm long $VIRT. As you can see [here](https://ibb.co/3drbWrc), when volatility in the market is higher, VIRT stock price gets higher too.    


If you want to be more quantitative, you could compute the correlation of VIRT to VIX, and also its beta against the market (which is negative). The good thing about VIRT is that it doesn't swing wildly, and it is a company (not an ETF/ETN tracking an index). So you won't see the type of portfolio-destroying swings in its price, compared to VIX-ETPs.   


I also like VIRT because its founder is kinda a savvy businessmen, and have just invested another $250mil in the company during recent sell off. Look him up. You also get nice quarterly dividends from VIRT.  


**2) Traditional safe havens: Gold, treasury bonds:** This is self explanatory I guess.   


\-/-  
So what are the risks? The main risk as highlighted in my previous market outlook is that, when there is ""extreme"" volatility, every asset prices typically move together in the same direction, as what happened previously with gold and treasury - therefore, no ""hedging"" characteristic.

Most stocks are sitting on Moving averages or gapping into resistance/moving averages. If the market falls, some of these bounces we have seen can turn into dead cat bounces but they could also bounce off of the moving averages they are sitting on and try to remount them to continue higher. I will not short anything into the hole. My plan is to wait for pullbacks today in order to get entries. As of right now my bias for the day overall is short but that could change if the market picks up and shows strength. These gaps aren't the best and that to me is always a sign of uncertainty in the market. Not many of the stocks have real catalyst either and most are moving with the market.  Patience has paid off for me in this market, waiting and timing good entries.

I know there is no crystal ball to figure out what to do but I'm assuming that the best thing to do is:

Keep in cash and wait. 

I could lose out as the market slowly rises again, if it has miraculously stabilized. There is little chance that it will skyrocket back to the level it was at before the crash so quickly that we won't realize it is stabilized. I should wait at least a couple of weeks as the losses are already there. 

However, it is just as likely, if not more, that we haven't seen the bottom yet. So, although timing wasn't great, I might have a chance to recover my losses if I just wait.

There is a third idea that everything is just going to be fracked anyways.

Say NO to Jerome Powell. Tell the Federal Reserve your thoughts. Say NO to hyper inflation if you love our country.

Nothing makes sense anymore. This pump is not justified for the economic situation we are in. This is no longer a dead cat bounce. This is the Fed's money printer.

Kazakhstan, one of the world’s biggest shippers of wheat flour, banned exports of that product along with others, including carrots, sugar and potatoes.

Serbia has stopped the flow of its sunflower oil and other goods, while Russia is leaving the door open to shipment bans and said it’s assessing the situation weekly.

It was caused by the company not meeting it's goals stated in it's loan agreements due to COVID-19. 

I bought 100 shares at 0.30 cents a piece. 1 day later it's jumped almost as high as $2 at times.

Before COVID-19, it averaged around $7 a share... 

At the moment if I sold at market price, I could profit around 400%. 

The reason I bought in was knowing #1 the stimulus was coming #2 courts are only criminal cases at the moment, so the financing companies would have a hard time enforcing anything anyway.

Hope this can help spur a discussion for everybody's benefit. This is not a an investment advice. You are not my client and I am not your fiduciary. That said, the views  below are just for discussion purposes.   


At the risk of being cliche and obviously wrong, here I go:  


**Short term-medium term:**  
1) We are in a bear market, and recession is already underway.   
2) Occasionally, there will be ""bear market rallies)"". For long term investors, these are not a time to buy **yet**, use it to sell instead. For traders, bear market rallies and the volatility that they bring, are great opportunities to make money. Dow Theory suggest there could be at least three bear market rallies within the overall bear market trend.

3) Reason why I think the downturn will continue for short-medium term: The USA is still early in the coronavirus infection blow out. Look at updated chart by JP Morgan and FT here and here. The Fed is doing everything they can to keep liquidity/market functioning. The fiscal stimulus that the government is trying to pass, should dampen the blow to the economy. But, as long as the coronavirus situation i.e, the public healthcare crisis, the real crisis, is not tackled immediately thorough decisive action like other countries, then it will only prolong the infection period. See Bill Gate and WHO's opinion here and here. IMO, the market is still underestimating the coronavirus infection and the blow to the economy that it could bring given ineffective measures by the government.

4) The market could at least fall for another 15% before it starts to find a bottom based on previous bear markets.   


**Longer term:**  


1) Stocks would eventually go into bull market again. 

  
2) Among the indicators that signal bottoming/reversal would be volatility (VIX) returning to normal level.   


3) High quality companies, I would imagine mega-tech with pristine balance sheet, would rally first and perhaps perform the best in the upcoming bull market.   


**Asset Allocation**  


***Short term***: Short equity via inverse ETF, short emerging market stock/currency - especially countries with twin deficits (fiscal and trade), long gold, long treasury. Or just stay in cash. 

***Risks:*** As what happened previously, gold and treasury did not provide the hedging characteristics. They went down together with stocks, while in normal condition, it they should go up. One possible explanation is that funds are liquidating any positions that they could, to satisfy redemption and margin call. 

***T******hings to avoid: 1)*** **Options**, because options are currently trading at premium in general due to high implied volatility. Also remember that with options, you have to nail three variables to make money - direction, magnitude, and time horizon.  Also, avoid **2) triple leveraged ETF/ETN.** The volatility and leveraged used in the ETFs will cause a ""decay"" in your return if the market trade sideways. As for ETN, their prices could fall to certain level that trigger ""acceleration event"" in which case, the investment banks issuing the ETNs will redeem the ETNs from you, usually at a steeply discounted price.  

***Long term:*** Long equity, with overweight on mid-mega cap tech stocks.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,360077,public,confidence,self,My Market Outlook,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fp9do8/my_market_outlook/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does the price in the two stock exchange move approximately the same as it is the same company with the same ratings/values or does each stock perform differently in each stock exchange based on economic situation in such country?   


Asking, because as a Hong Kong resident I can trade both in US markets and HK markets. The latter is more convenient for me due to no exchange rates plus no taxes (yay HK no capital gain taxes).   
There are several investment products which are quoted both in Hong Kong and US, but the same applies to other countries as well. Assume i feel that the US market is more reliable due to overall political situation and economic conditions.   


Should i expect the same stock to perform similarly (i'm not expecting 1:1) between two or more stock exchanges or I should expect the same stock to perform completely different based on the stock exchange it is listed? At sense, I would say it depends on the stock exchange as different investors perform in different stock exchanges as well as arbitrage opportunities (HK opens earlier, if 9988.HK goes up and i expect $BABA to catch up later in the day i might just abuse some knowledge to arbitrage) but if i'm considering the whole picture.

It compared the daily percentage changes (from the recent high) over 100 days for each recession period.

I know in the community info it does give you resources but since this will only last a few months more max before the market starts to go back up (I'm assuming) I want to learn as much as I can in the next few weeks (realistically as much as possible in as little time as possible) so I only want to learn the most important attributes of investing in the stock market and I can learn the rest afterwards. What would you consider the most important things to learn in order to keep up? I dont expect to learn a lot or even be an advanced investor I just dont want to miss this.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday’s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month’s record highs.

*****

&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to “stabilize key national industries,” according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

*****

&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.

*****

&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is “very special” to him. The president added, “I’m not sure that’s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.” He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be “based on hard facts and data” and will be “grounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.”

*****

&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy’s more than 69,100 cases are second only China’s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy’s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles’ household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

*****

&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that’s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it’s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.

The Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up less than 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 future was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 contract was down 0.4%. 

Also be aware that during the great recession following the 1929 stock market crash, we had a lot of 10 % moves to the upside, while the overall direction of the market was down:

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

Hi there, I’ll quickly state that I’m very very new to investing, like I’ve not invested yet, in my entire life, but I have been watching this reddit somewhat closely over the past month or so. 

Some background information. I am 17 in May and I am from the United Kingdom. I have roughly £5000 to invest right now and I can add roughly £300 a month to this. (I know it’s not a lot, but being 16 still I only have a part time job sadly). 

My main question is what is the best way to invest? Through a mobile app? What is the easiest way to invest and keep track of my investments and is there any places that don’t have fees? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 

Also the main stocks I am looking into buying are Coca Cola ( KO ), for its long term dividend pay outs, and as it has obviously greatly decreased in price but I feel after this crisis is over it’s value will return. I have also been keeping an eye on Apple and Disney and would appreciate any thoughts on this?

You don't see a lot of international futures data being talked about in here. 

Considering the fact that global markets have a rolling influence on each other (in both directions), and that a strong day (during regular market hours) in Europe and Asia can affect how U.S. markets open, does it make sense to keep an eye on the **futures** for these international markets during the afternoon/evening in the U.S.?  I'm asking about futures because many of these int'l markets don't open for regular trading until after hours in the U.S. has closed for the day.

I was holding some inverse ETFs going into today (DJI +11%), and knew I was in trouble looking at DJI futures overnight.  Had I looked at ""Weekend Wall Street"" / [IG.com's futures page for the Nikkei](https://www.ig.com/en/indices/markets-indices/japan-225) or another source of futures data for Japan, U.K, etc., I might have sold my position before after hours trading ended yesterday evening. 

What's the best way to use this data, considering the rolling effect of Asia &gt; Europe &gt; U.S. &gt; Asia, and so on?  Is it even a valid strategy? 

I'm sure there's correlation data out there, but I wouldn't know where to start. Factor in news events and domestic factors, and I'd imagine this type of prediction could be quickly undermined. 

For example, I'm seeing that the Nikkei is 6.5% according the link above (7:00pm EDT). Europe is up 1-2% as well. I'd be inclined to think tomorrow stands a decent chance of opening in the green considering we're still waiting for the Senate covid bill to pass, and had a positive momentum today.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,357715,public,confidence,self,"Predicting market open using international futures?

Anticipating how this would play out, I took absolutely everything, 401k and all, out of stocks when the DJIA was 26.5k (still with brokerage, but not in play), so I avoided a lot of the drop that's happened to-date... With the plan to sell high, buy low. Clearly if I buy in today, tomorrow, or likely any time in the coming months, I'll be ahead.

I'm thinking it's better to get in before the bottom completely finds itself, vs getting in late once the rallies start to really kick in. I have been saying for some time that I'd be waiting for this Thursday's jobs report, let the drop set-in, and then buy back in, maybe EOD Thursday, Friday or even Monday... accepting that it may not be the complete bottom, but close enough.

And secondarily, for the bulk of my assets, I'll be rejoining in the form of general/non-industry specific mutual funds, mostly large cap... When the eventual rebound/rally does kick in, do you all think value or growth oriented funds will see the best gains over the next 6 months (not long-term over years), assuming we are in a V or U curve rebound? I'm thinking value for now, shifting back into growth funds once *some* broader economic health is restored in a year or so.

Stimulus package will pass anytime today or tomorrow and we can expect further upside this week

However, need to tread carefully because when milestones like 50K patients are reached, there will be a tear down 

I also don’t believe in sending checks alone will help the masses. It’s gonnabe a food fight. Besides it’s only going to people based on income. If you are over 150K you can assume nothing is coming in the mail.

Besides, that 1000 bucks or 2000 means jack shit for a family with kids. Student loan forgiveness is also not necessary.

What will truly work is suspension of mortgage and credit card payments for three months.

They found that no two bubbles are alike, but they all share a common structure. Below we’ve summarized the five key stages of market bubbles that allow you to identify them as they happen.\n\n \n1. Displacement:\nBubbles start with a displacement, some sort of a shock to the system. A displacement could be war (usually the end of war), a major political change, deregulation, a technological innovation, a financial innovation or a shift in monetary policy. The displacement creates a new opportunity in at least one sector of the economy. One example is the widespread adoption of computers, the internet and email in the US in the 1990s, which set the stage for the dot-com bubble.\n \n2. Boom:\nA boom begins, especially in the favored sector, as optimism grows. There is a positive feedback loop as the price of stocks, one or more commodities, and/ or real estate increase, which then leads to greater consumption and investment, which leads to greater economic growth. Credit fuels the boom. Borrowers become more willing to take on debt and lenders are increasingly willing to make riskier loans as economic prospects improve. This expansion of credit isn’t necessarily provided by banks. The Tulip Mania in 1636 in Holland, for example, was fueled by vendor-financing from bulb sellers. However, banks have been the predominant source of credit since the 19th century. Banks can expand credit further and more rapidly than vendors could. To make matters worse, new banks are often formed in the expanding economy. This causes banks to further loosen their credit standards to avoid losing market share.\n \n3. Euphoria:\nA boom transforms into euphoria as “rational exuberance morphs into irrational exuberance.” There are hundreds of books documenting the endless possibilities of the economy (e.g. Japan as Number One and The East Asian Miracle in Japan in the 1980s, and Dow 40,000 in 1999). Participants extrapolate recent price increases into the future, expecting prices to continue to increase at unsustainable rates. Some, especially industry insiders, realize that there is a bubble, but many continue to participate in the market, believing they can sell to “the greater fool” before the implosion.\nHowever, more and more euphoric outsiders begin to enter the market as media attention grows and individuals see others getting rich. As Kindleberger quoted in Manias, Panics and Crashes, “there is nothing as disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.” The rush of capital causes a further increase in prices, and sound investment shifts to wild speculation. Individuals invest with the hope of short-term capital gains, and debt compounds as people borrow or trade on margin to further speculate. Money seems free. Fraud is also common at this stage, although it typically is not exposed until later.\n \n4. Distress:\nAt some point, an event hits that causes a decline in confidence and a pause in the explosive price increase. The event could be a bankruptcy, a change in government policy, a piece of news (real or rumored), or a flow of funds from the country. The response to these events differs in bubbles because of the debt build-up. People who financed their purchases with borrowed money become distressed sellers as the income on their assets drops below their interest payments. Kindleberger noted, “The economic situation in a country after several years of bubble-like behavior resembles that of a young person on a bicycle; the rider needs to maintain forward momentum or the bike becomes unstable.” A slowing bike is actually a better metaphor than a bubble.  Sometimes panic sets in immediately, but in other cases it can take up to several years for the crisis to fully develop. In the dot-com crisis, panic happened almost immediately, while it took a few months for panic to set in during the Great Financial Crisis (see the chart below).\n \n \n5. Panic:\nNot everyone realizes that a crisis is unfolding at the same time. Insiders and institutional investors usually sell first. Once other market participants realize the gravity of the situation (perhaps after another major event), run-of-the-mill selling turns into outright panic as everyone tries to get out at the same time. Prices plummet and levered companies increasingly go bankrupt as they can’t meet their interest payments. The sell-off typically spreads to other sectors and other countries. As bankruptcies mount, banks can begin to fail, further drying up credit when it’s needed the most. The panic continues until a lender of last resort convinces investors that cash will be made available to meet demand, or prices fall so low that value investors start to buy back in.\nKindleberger bubble cycle\n\nOne crisis can often lead to the next bubble in the same or another country. For example, the pricking of the bubble in Japan in the early 1990s led to a surge of funds to Asia. The crisis in Asian countries in 1997 and 1998 led to funds flooding into the United States. This contributed to the dot-com bubble. Furthermore, as Kindleberger noted, The mild and short recession in 2001 after the massive implosion in U.S. stock prices resulted from the abrupt change in policy of the Federal Reserve and its rapid and aggressive move to reduce interest rates… The Fed reduced short-term interest rates to 1 percent and since the inflation rate was nearer 2 percent, real short-term interest rates were negative. One result was a boom in the housing market; house prices increased sharply in New York, Boston, Washington, and Los Angeles. Skeptics wondered whether the deflationary effects of the implosion of the stock price bubble had been largely offset by a bubble in the housing market.\n\nCould the response to the Financial Crisis have sown the seeds to yet another bubble or bubbles? With historic lows in S&amp;P volatility, is there trouble brewing under the surface? Only time will tell, but history is a prescient guide.\n\nSource: https://www.variantperception.com/2017/09/22/the-anatomy-of-a-bubble/\n\n[edit: fixed formatting]', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kindleberger’s classic, Panics, Manias and Crashes, he expands on earlier work by Minsky in Stabilizing an Unstable Economy.

What information changed from 24 hours ago?

On the outside we are in the middle of a pandemic and our global work force is partially on hold.   Our economy is heavily based on consumerism and the Dow is almost up 10%?   On the outside it makes zero sense.


I am ranting.  Is this because Trump told his old rich guy pact that he will put the stock market over deaths late last night?    

They probably already have an inside list of the “top big to fail” that they made last night.        This lets the rich investors come in and buy the airline, hotel, and other travel stocks without fear of losing because at this point the stocks are so low if they go any lower the Fed will save the companies.     

So if you are an ultra rich guy you basically can throw 50 million at some airlines stocks.   5 years from now those investments can probably quadruple or more.  

The stock market is volatile as F.  If you have hundreds of millions of dollars you might as well invest in the airlines because what do you have to lose right?

SPY sitting right underneath the 234 pivot which is acting as resistance pre market. All gappers are gapping up with the market, not any earnings plays and almost all gappers are sitting at the 9 EMA. There is lots of stocks gapping and plenty will be tradeable, I just picked what I thought were interesting to me. Not sure how today goes. If SPY can get over 234 and hold, that is a good sign. If the markest is strong, hopefully these stocks can break the 9 ema and we should get some nice plays.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 24th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-24-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures hit their 5% “limit up” levels Tuesday as top Senate and White House officials neared a $2 trillion deal to rescue the economy from the coronavirus crisis. The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve’s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday’s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.

*****

&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats’ $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. “I’m not looking at months,” the president said.

*****

&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.

*****

&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.

Intro:\n\nYou may know Bob, he is the worst market timer in the world. He bought shares only 4 times in his life just before last 4 Market crashes (not counting Corona\'s) and still he retired with a good lump of extra money.\n\nIf you are not familiar with Bob\'s story, you can read more about him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs_Europe/comments/fc8spa/are_you_a_new_investor/)\n\nOf course Bob doesn\'t exist, is just an imaginary friend that we always remember in troubled Markets times like this one. Especially if you are a long term investor buying and holding Indexes.\n\nBut guess what, many people doubt of Bob\'s story. For reasons such as:\n\n* *""It relies on sampling bias.""*\n* *""The time period cited is the highest returning period of time of any recorded stock market in any country ever. ""*\n* *""He was lucky enough to start investing in the S&amp;P in 1975 and not basically any other market or any other time period ever.""*\n* *""It doesn\'t discuss actual returns.""*\n\n**He is even banned and you can\'t mention him on some communities!.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me Bob\'s story is simplistic but strong enough to accepted it, If you just take a look to SP500 evolution during last 50 years you clearly see why Index Buy and Hold works.\n\nYes, I know it, past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Nobody knows how US or any other Market will go in the next 50 years, but with the same logic we can\'t asure that next 50 years will be **much** worst than previous 80. Project more or less the same return sounds pretty fair.\n\nAlso, compound interest and companies apetite to make money are enough evidence that, on the long run, the Market will give you extra money.\n\nI don\'t want to start a crusade on Bob\'s behalf, but these unexpected foes that he have, sparked in me the need to check his story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**All right then, enough chit chat, let\'s see if Bob was just lucky or the idea behind his plan makes sense.**\n\n# Methodology:\n\nI\'m going to check what happens if you invest a fixed amount of money per month buying an index and holding it for n Years. Also which was the best period to buy and hold and the worst one. On top of the indexes I also contemplated an hypothetical TER. Dividends are not considered.\n\nBecause Bob, or actually these Bobs are bad timers they were buying shares at **month\'s high**.\n\n# Scenario 1:\n\nThis is Bob\'s scenario. Original Bob started investing on 1970 and finished on 2013 with a Portfolio valued in **USD 1.1M (USD 916k gains)**. Let\'s see what would have happened if he invested in any other 43 years periods:\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* Simulation Period: 02/1928 - 02/2020 (MM/YYYY)\n* Holding Period: 43 Years\n* Monthly Buy: USD 356\u202c (Total Invested: \\~ USD 183700)\n* TER: 0.2 %\n* Index: SP500 (\\^GSPC)\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n09kfg9swgo41.jpg?width=8400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758689c93d1b11e135a795540f6cbd10bf0f0bdc\n\nSo, on worst case, meaning if he started investing on January 1932 and finished 43 years after, on January 1975, he would have finished with USD 410k extra, a profit of 223%. Worse than original Bob but not bad.\n\nBest case: From 04/57 to 04/00, USD 2177M gain (1185%)\n\nDo you want to know the average?: is it the white dashed line, **USD 1,011,372 (551%),** close but even more than original Bob.\n\n# Scenario 2:\n\nWell, I don\'t know you, but unfortunately I didn\'t start investing at 22 like Bob, I started on my early 30\'s and although some people invested 40+ years are not the majority. Lets check another scenario less favorable, with shorter Holding Period.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* Simulation Period: 02/1928 - 02/2020\n* Holding Period: 30 Years\n* Monthly Buy: USD 356 (Total Invested: USD 128160)\n* TER: 0.2 %\n* Index: SP500 (\\^GSPC)\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65xht2i2ygo41.jpg?width=8400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48fd057bc840bcb889f1e29b773d9b5c024b26c\n\n**Average: USD 351,010 (274%)**\n\nMmm, not so nice of course, but still, you **always** would have won.\n\nLet\'s see what happens with even shorter Holding Periods...\n\n# Scenario 3:\n\n**Parameters (from now on I just show those that changes compared with previous Scenario):**\n\n* Holding Period: 20 Years\n* Monthly Buy: USD 356 (Total Invested: USD 85440)\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3u7su6kuzgo41.jpg?width=8400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ec911f9498192e9718ca5202337de680c11a76\n\n**Average: USD 114,480 (134%)**\n\nUps, our first decline, if you invested on the period from 01/55 to 01/75 you would have **loss** USD 1000. Probably this won\'t happened in reality because I\'m not considering dividends, with them you would have gain about [0,6%](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs_Europe/comments/ffc8f2/visualizing_the_best_worst_investment_periods_in/).\n\n# Scenario 4:\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* Holding Period: 10 Years\n* Monthly Buy: USD 356 (Total Invested: USD 42720)\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7dljlgq1ho41.jpg?width=8400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b722299305c0a4bcca2c5c998bcba994f3d3529a\n\n**Average: USD 19,585 (46%)**\n\nStill, not bad, but you could have lost money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**And what about other Markets?, what about Europe?.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Europe:\n\nAlthough SP500\'s companies were and are omnipresent on almost every well diversified ETF, checking what happened with Europe is also a good benchmark, more over because this community is focused on the old continent.\n\nThe problem as you probably guess is that Europe hasn\'t an old index such as SP500, and not even a currency as old as USD, but anyway, let\'s check what would happened to Bob\'s European cousin: Jan\n\n# Scenario 5:\n\nMeet Jan...\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* Simulation Period: 02/1999 - 02/2020\n* Holding Period: 20 Years\n* Monthly Buy: EUR 300\u202c (Total Invested: EUR 72000)\n* TER: 0.2 %\n* Index: STOX 50 (\\^STOXX50E)\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqxna6t84ho41.jpg?width=8400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a03ec5203a586c65c506335c17b889de59d056b\n\n**Average: EUR 5866 (8%)**\n\n# Scenario 6:\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* Holding Period: 15 Years\n* Monthly Buy: EUR 300\u202c (Total Invested: EUR 54000)\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1duxvhyjho41.jpg?width=8400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9424ad75002654816257c9229d0c7987408136f3\n\n**Average: EUR 3664 (7%)**\n\n# Scenario 7:\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* Holding Period: 10 Years\n* Monthly Buy: EUR 300\u202c (Total Invested: EUR 36000)\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/06auaets4ho41.jpg?width=8400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c538cf6f82f448ce42ca6e75644885d5d077911\n\n**Average: EUR -1445 (-4%)**\n\n# Scenario 8 (and last one, I promise):\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* Simulation Period: 02/2009 - 02/2020\n* Holding Period: 10 Years\n* Monthly Buy: EUR 300\u202c (Total Invested: EUR 36000)\n* TER: 0 % (Included on the ETF)\n* ETF: IShares Core MSCI Europe UCITS ETF EUR (IQQY.DE).

The only investments I have is my RRSP and they're all in high risk US and global equity because I'm young and not going to retire for an other 30+ years. 

Anyways, so basically we know that the stock market crashed. When the stock market crashes, where does the money go? Into thin air? Is there less currency in circulation now? 

I understand that central banks can ""create"" money which is the modern equivalent of printing it. Are they basically trying to reintroduce some of the currency that was lost in the stock market crash? 

How is this going to affect inflation? 

Is that money that the fed is creating also helping to pay for the coronavirus response such as the money that everyone is getting, mortgage payments being deferred, utilities being deferred etc?

A lot of experts talk about theoretical bottoms and the impact of stimulus and i wonder if that matters.   


i don't see how anything can go up at all until we   have no new cases for a few days or some other significant event that shows we've beat it, or a readily available treatment or a vaccine.

Specifically in this stream we covered the state of the market as it relates to the outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus), including:

- Why the market is crashing

- How limit up and limit down works

- Investing in airlines and cruise stocks

- The fall and future of Boeing

- The recent actions of the federal reserve

- Where we go from here

This was kind of an impromptu stream but IMO turned out to be one of the best so far and touched on many current issues that are affecting the global economy so if you're looking for a broad summary of how all these pieces fit together, this is it.

If you’ve been sitting in cash and want to buy but are worried that stocks will go lower, then break up your purchases. The math behind lump sum over dollar cost averaging  has been settled, but this is a time where emotions matter more than spreadsheets.

What’s critical is that you don’t just make mental plans to get back in, you have to write them down. For example, “I will break up my purchases into four tranches, the first Wednesday of every month for the next four months.” Whatever it is, it doesn’t have to be rocket science, it just has to exist.

The individual Form 4 [forms](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=17843&amp;owner=exclude&amp;action=getcompany&amp;Find=Search) do not give any explanation for these purchases, so it is safe to assume these purchases are not for any pre-arranged plans.

The [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/17843/000119312519246588/d791270ddef14a.htm) tells us that Carpenter Tech has stock ownership guidelines that require the CEO to own 5x their base salary in stock, the SVPs to own 3x their base salaries, and the VPs to own 2x their base salaries.

Before the market crash, all of the executives were well above their required ownership amount, but the crash put everyone well below their requirements and none of their purchasing activity has pushed them over the requirement.

The bank's ""key question now"" is whether an EPS recovery will be V-, U-, or L-shaped through 2020 and into 2021. Initial estimates pegged the virus' hit as a sharp decline in economic activity before demand roars back just as quickly in the second half of the year. Such a trend would drive a V-shaped recovery in EPS, but the latest measures taken to combat the coronavirus' spread could now force a more U-shaped rebound, Goldman said.

Demetri Kofinas speaks with Ben Hubbard, the Beirut bureau chief for The New York Times about Saudi Arabia and the rise to power of Mohammed bin Salman. Topics include the ongoing oil price war, tensions with Iran, the war in Yemen, and the geopolitics of the Middle East. The two also discuss the impact of coronavirus for the region’s politics and security. 

According to Ben Hubbard, when King Salman of Saudi Arabia ascended to the throne in January 2015 and began bestowing enormous powers on his 29-year-old son, Mohammed bin Salman, it sent minds reeling. Given Saudi Arabia’s importance as the wealthiest country in the Middle East and a key partner of the West, foreign officials, journalists, experts, and spies had long scrutinized the Saudi royal family to anticipate who might come to power in the future—and MBS, as he was known, had remained far off the radar. Who, they wondered, was this inexperienced young prince who swiftly asserted his control over the kingdom’s oil, military, finances, and domestic and foreign policy?

Today gld is not stopping it's upward momentum for any reason. We are seeing a lot of strength in the buying with high volume and steady ascent.  

My reasons for calling a gold buy are this:

1. We are seeing a disconnect now between the movements of gold and the S&amp;P 500. The deflationary environment of basically all assets there for a week or two has seemingly ended and the steady flow to gold as safe haven I believe has begun. Those who were going to sell their gold have and now we are seeing the steady flow buying as this virus gets worse and worse and the central bank extends it's balance sheet further to prop up markets.
2. Now that the relationship has deteriorated and gold appears to be transitioning to a negative relationship with spy it provides a strong hedge against the downsides of the virus and financial turmoil. With US oil suffering immensely and the virus ravaging the nation we could see a credit crunch as some banks suffering immensely on credit lines that are extended currently. Gold loves financial turmoil much more than it responds to real world demand shocks. 
3. Once it begins it's upward trajectory and investors realize it's regained safe haven status we are going to see a massive spike in price. 

Note: It's important to realize that gold also is driven by demand for it in electronics and other industries and it's sharp deflation at the onset of the downturn was probably a response to the possible lack of demand. The virus could get bad enough that gold suffers because the demand for it as a safe haven is offset by the lack of real world demand for the metal. 

Also I am unsure of how exactly gold will respond when the stimulus bill inevitably passes.

As always I could very well be wrong and am happy hear any reasons why.

I can't understand how in the hell the market can be down over 600 points, just a slaughterfest, but my volatility stock is down over 20%. It's been my understanding that the lower the market drops, the more futures contracts are set in place. But I don't understand what's going on at all here. 

That being said, I'm a total, world-class, lay dipshit, so the simpler an answer the more I'd appreciate the insight.

We are continuing to look at which executives are buying up some of their own stock at these low prices. While you should never base your purchasing decisions on the purchasing activity of executives, it can be a useful indicator for finding companies whose executives believe are near their bottom prices and are worth looking deeper into. 

Executives could just be buying stock to meet ownership guidelines or trying to instill faith in their shareholders by purchasing their own stock, but it is still reasonable to conclude that if the executives believed the stock was going to continue plummeting, they would wait to purchase until it did so (of course, even executives won’t always get their timing correct). We don’t exactly know how ownership guidelines change during a market crash, but it is probably safe to assume that the guideline is relaxed for a period of time or until the market has recovered.

### Chimera Investment Corp ([$CIM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim/)) - Insider Purchases

We wrote about Chimera last week, but they recently amended their Form 4s to clarify that what they previously said were stock grants were actually purchases by the executives and directors.

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim/):

&gt;Chimera Investment Corporation operates as a real estate investment trust in the United States. The company, through its subsidiaries, invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities secured by pools of commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and other real estate related securities

Chimera was on a slight upward trajectory during the beginning of the year before falling 58% from their high of $22.98 to their closing price on March 20th of $9.55.

Their [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1409493&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) activity shows that all of their executives (and one director) made purchases (with 4 of the 5 executives making sizable six-figure purchases) on March 18th.

|Date|Executive Name|Title|Type|Grant Price|$ Amount Received|\# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase|

|2020-03-18|Gerard Creagh|Director|P-Purchase|$8.44|$303.8K|36.0K|153.6K|31%|
|2020-03-18|Matthew Lambiase|CEO|P-Purchase|$8.51|$425.5K|50.0K|993.9K|5%|

|2020-03-18|Phillip Kardis|Chief Legal|P-Purchase|$8.11|$24.3K|3.0K|186.5K|2%|

Looking at the CEO’s individual [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000115752320000382/xslF345X03/form4.xml), we see that these were in fact open market purchases and not stock grants as was originally reported. The Form 4 also does not mention that these purchases are part of any pre-arranged plans.


The [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000120677419001325/cim3506171-def14a.htm) verifies that Chimera does have ownership guidelines for the executives and directors that require the CEO to own 5x their annual salary in stock, the other named executives to own 3x their salary, and the directors to own 5x their annual cash retainer.

Even with the almost 60% stock decline, all of the executives and the director that purchased stock are well above their required holding threshold (except the Chief Legal Officer).

This Stock is one of the few really positioned to profit from extended social distancing and lockdowns. My own College (University of Maryland) bought its services to finish the semester online. Government agencies and large companies are also using it for teleworking purposes.

**Fundamental Analysis:**

ZM showed Impressive Earnings and Sales growth BEFORE Covid-19 hit.

* EPS % Change Last Qtr up 275%
* Sales % Change Last Qtr up 78%
* 1 QTR before that EPS % Change up 800% and sales up 85%
* Last quarter ZM reported an EPS surprise of **114%**

The Annual EPS Estimates for earnings for 2021 is .45 up 29% from 2020, and in 2022 the EPS estimates is up a further 29%. The estimates are being revised upward and likely Earnings will vastly outperform the estimates due to Covid-19.

ZM’s return on equity is 21%, indicating a well run company. ZM’s after tax margins have also been accelerating the past 2 quarters: 15.1% reported in December and 23% reported in march.  

Big Funds and Financial Institutions are increasing their stake in the company. Last reported there was a 5% increase in fund ownership of the company, and since it is a recent IPO there are a lot of outstanding shares for institutions to buy.

ZM’s ratings from Investor’s Business Daily:

Composite Rating: 99

EPS Rating: 84

RS Rating: 98

Accumulation Distribution Rating: A+

**Technical Analysis:**

New Price Highs

* ZM’s chart is about the best you can find out there. It is hitting new price highs during a major correction. That shows you something special about a company and tells you that there is incredible demand for the stock

New Relative Strength High

* ZM’s Relative strength line (plotting ZM’s price/ price of the spy for each day) has been making new highs since 2/26 and is skyrocketing. This shows you that a stock has incredible momentum behind its move and is vastly outperforming the S&amp;P 500. 

Proper Buy Point

* I bought the stock at 108.50 as it broke out of short term consolidation on above average volume. There was also another buy point as it broke through its prior high at 129.83. The stock is extended right now from support but will present more buying opportunities as holders take profits and it rests briefly.

Joseph D. Piotroski works as an Associate Professor of Accounting at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.  

 In 2000, he wrote the paper, Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Information to Separate Winners from Losers. It was this paper that outlined 9 fundamental ranking criteria for picking winning stocks.  

Using his stock-picking criteria, he was able to theoretically average 23% annual gains between the years 1976 and 1996. In 2020, the annual return is down to **15%**. However, the method works extremely well after a recession with a return of **138%** in 2010.   

During 2010 as the market sprang back to life, his strategy worked over 5 times better than his previous average.  Piotroski F-Score is a number between 0-9 which is used to assess the strength of a company’s financial position. The Score is used by financial investors in order to find the best value stocks (nine being the best).

Narrowing secular passive investment trends have been the key to such a steady march upwards over the last decade. This increasingly polarized investment trend of passively directing stock purchase towards large cap companies has stifled critical price discovery achieved through fundamental security level analysis. We are now transitioning into highly volatile times as the market advances from a “low entropy state” to a “high entropy state”.

Let me explain what I mean by “entropy” a little better. Over the past decade, individual investing strategies have become increasingly correlated with one another. This simply means that your investment allocations, the individual companies you implicitly own, have likely been very similar to that of the person standing next to you. Moving forward in time, that correlation will diminish as investor strategies diverge through a process of seeking more adequately valued assets.

**Individual Retirement Savings Plans (think 401k)**

Herding individual investors into retirement savings plans (with few options in the way of true investment autonomy) has created a beast. Not only has it created the beast, it only provides the investor with a narrow spread of options which are, in effect, now a volatility engine with the ability to rebalance asset classes from anywhere rapidly.

**Available Liquidity**

There isn’t even enough investor money in the market at present to bring it back to January 2020 levels. Over the past month, much destruction has already occurred to capital and valuations are down.

**The Fed**

The Federal Reserve has been propping up both lending institutions and an unknown number of companies since the great recession (the means by which this has been accomplished is complicated and outside the focus of this article). The Fed’s easing will now need to be aimed more directly to the common people of this country instead of those who own vast amounts of wealth.

**Conclusion**

The assumpon that the market, as most people gauge it, will bounce right back after COVID-19 presupposes that investor sentiments will suddenly merge in harmony. This is not likely to happen.

&gt;In regards to [$FONU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FONU&amp;src=cashtag_click) the motion for custodianship was successfully granted by way of a minute order (without a hearing). We will continue to provide regular updates as we work towards solidifying a merger candidate that we have in place. [$Fonu](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24Fonu&amp;src=cashtag_click)

The other party never showed, therefore tomorrow it will be reported officially that custodian has been initiated.

I want to see everyones gains from this one. This is going to be an absolute monster.

Thank me later ;)

House, condo, doesn't matter as long as you own it.

For 99.9% of people the largest purchase the will ever make is their primary residence.  If you do not own a house and you are playing the market you will be tremendously nervous and frightened during significant market turbulence. You will have this purchase in the back of your mind and you won't want to risk money that could have gone towards it. For most people, this will prevent them from staying the course and they will end up getting mediocre investment returns.

I own a house and have a solid 40% equity position in it. I also have good chunk of money invested in the stock market and to be perfectly honest I don't care at all what happens to that money in the short term. All i care is what happens in 10+ years as i have literally 0 need for that money. This provides me a level of comfort to ride the market out.

SPY still hanging out around support. We are seeing  buying happening pre market with buyers stepping in at 218. Still a chance this support level holds. So far this is looking like it could be a choppy day. If the market drops, these bounces we saw last week in most stocks can turn into dead cat bounces and I'll look to try and short them back to support. If the market stays strong we may see a continuation of strength. I'll be focusing on TQQQ as I feel it will have a range and may move cleaner than individual stocks. Being patient in this market.  If the market falls, here are the circuit breaker levels.

 

* **Level 1:** A drop of 7% from the prior day's closing price of the S&amp;P 500 triggers a 15-minute trading halt. Trading is not halted if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m. ET.
* **Level 2:** A drop of 13% triggers a 15-minute halt. Trading is not halted if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m. ET.
* **Level 3:** A drop of 20% triggers a halt for the rest of the trading day, and trading resumes the following day.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 23rd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-23-2020.html)

&gt; * U.S. stock futures turned strongly positive Monday morning after the Federal Reserve pledged asset purchases with no limit to support markets. Dow futures hit their 5% “limit down” overnight, and were off 600-points at one stage Monday morning, as a massive coronavirus funding package failed a key Senate procedural vote Sunday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked another 900 points or 4.5% on Friday, bringing the weekly decline to over 17% for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Ahead of Monday’s session, the Dow was off more than 35% from last month’s record highs. The New York Stock Exchange’s trading floor will be close starting Monday. The NYSE will go to fully electronic trading. The 10-year Treasury yield, which popped back above 1% last week, was below that level early Monday.

*****

&gt; * Top-level White House and congressional negotiators burned the midnight oil over the now-nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package. Democrats blocked the bill in Sunday’s vote, saying it did too much to bail out companies and not enough to help workers. Several GOP senators, including Rand Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus, were not present to vote. Others, such as Mitt Romney, were in quarantine as a precaution. The Federal Reserve and Treasury are working on financing programs that could be worth $4 trillion. Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Boeing, which is hoping for a bailout. Boeing stock has dropped 80% from recent highs on the dual crises of the outbreak and the grounding of its 737 Max.

*****

&gt; * The United States has the third most coronavirus cases in the world, with over 35,000 and 471 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than half the U.S. cases are in New York, where the death toll increased to 153. Washington state has the second-most cases, with nearly 2,000 confirmed and 95 deaths. New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. New York plans to run a clinical trial, beginning Tuesday, of a treatment regimen of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin, a drug cocktail that has shown promise in fighting the coronavirus.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases topped 343,000, with 14,789 deaths and over 98,800 recoveries. China, where the outbreak started in December, still has the most cases at over 81,400. China’s 3,274 deaths are second to Italy’s 5,476 deaths. Italy is second in total cases at over 59,100. The U.S., Spain and Germany round out the top five countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into quarantine over the weekend after contact with a doctor who tested positive for the virus. The German government is set to unveil major stimulus measures. Pressure mounts to cancel the Tokyo summer Olympics, set to begin at the end of July. Canada said it won’t send teams to compete. Local media reports indicate that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering a delay.

*****

&gt; * Cisco Systems is committing $225 million to assist in efforts aimed at combating the coronavirus while the rest of Silicon Valley also initiates an investment blitz. 3M said it will supply New York and Seattle with a half-million N95 respirator masks to address the ongoing shortage of health-care equipment. Merck said it will supply New York City with a half-million masks. Chinese billionaire and Alibaba founder Jack Ma sent to Africa 5.4 million face masks, over 1 million testing kits, 40,000 sets of protective clothing and 60,000 protective face shields. BlackRock is committing $50 million in outbreak relief.

I’m buying heavily right now.  Currently at 1.2 beta, moving to 1.5 over coming weeks.

The stock market precedes the economy; the current decline in stock indices is preceding the expected decline in economic growth (GDP).  Since the stock market and the economy are slightly out of phase, it’s not uncommon for the stock market to begin rebounding as the economic data worsens.  

The reason I’m posting this is, if you see that the market is down 30% now, it’s easy to think “wow it’s really going to go down in 2,3,4, etc months when this hits unemployment, GDP slows down, etc” but the reality is the market is reflecting that future data now, so it may be strongly rebounding just as economic data is at its worst.  

Great example is 2009, the US economy was in shambles but the S&amp;P finished the year up 26%.  Yes it had a lot of room to run (-37% in 2008).  1987, a rapid market collapse similar to 2020, finished the year positive 5.25%.

Whether you're up to date of what's been going on or not, I will give you a brief explanation of what’s happening in the stock market.  

&amp;#x200B;

\- We’ve been in a bull market for the past 11 years. 

\- Out of nowhere, a flu originated in Wuhan in early January 2020. 

\- The Wuhan Health Commission basically knew that the virus was very contagious immediately but kept it under wraps. 

\- Before you know it, everybody from all over the world starts to get infected. 

\- Fears begin to escalate, investors start to panic, and markets start to take HUGE losses.  

&amp;#x200B;

And now, we’re here.  

&amp;#x200B;

With the number of cases increasing, countries are quarantining themselves, schools and institutions where groups of people gather are now shut down, and grocery stores are completely empty. Fears are at all-time highs, but could it be all in vain?  Everybody is afraid to even leave their house in fear that they’ll get the virus, which leads to less stimulation in the economy, and consumer spending supports 70% of the economy. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, we’re already experiencing our first layoffs in the United States. If things continue like this or even get worse, this recession is pretty much inevitable (in my opinion).   With all this happening in just a matter of a couple of months, it’s like the perfect storm. Of course, the virus was the catalyst to it, but you also have the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as interest rates being reduced.  

Here are the reasons:  

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*1.) BLACK SWAN EVENT\*\*

A black swan event is an extremely rare event that is beyond what is normally expected, and they are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and the fact that they cannot be predicted beforehand.  See, it was always believed that all swans were white, and that black swans did not exist. Sure enough, that all changed in 1697 when Dutch explorers became the first Europeans to ever see a black swan, where they're located in Western Australia.  Judging by this situation going on in the world right now, this is definitely a black swan event that could turn into catastrophic losses, causing a recession. Some may argue that it already is.  

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2.) INVERTED YIELD CURVE\*\* 

The Inverted Yield Curve is an indicator that has predicted the past 7 recessions, including the DotCom Bubble and the Great Recession. Basically, when this yield inverts, markets are basically suggesting that outlook for the short term will have a greater return than the outlook for the long term. 

These “yields” are 2 year and 10-year bonds. When a 2-year bond has a higher rate than a 10-year bond, then it is a sign that outlook in the future is very uncertain.  In August 2019, the yield curve inverted. It’s only a matter of time that the IYC will have predicted the past 8 recessions.  

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*3.) SIGNS ARE ALREADY HERE\*\* 

The first signs of recessions are already appearing. Layoffs have already begun, the Federal Reserve has already cut interest rates twice in March, already reaching sub-zero levels. At this rate, we could possibly see NEGATIVE interest rates. On top of that, the Fed is trying to stimulate the economy by injecting almost 2 TRILLION dollars into markets.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, a recession is what we need. We have been in a bull market for nearly 11 years, it can’t go up forever. The best thing to do at this point is to dollar cost average for all of your investments. When something is on sale, do you panic or buy it? What are your thoughts? Do you think this will be an ordinary downturn in the economy, or could it be much worse than the Great Depression? Let's start a discussion!

I'm fairly new to the stock market and am just understanding basic market terms / vocab / processes. I've got a question for those more experienced than me w/ the current market if anyone can help.

My position -- I've got roughly 8-10k of creditcard debt that I'm paying off, though I've got low payments and I have roughly 800-1,400 a month roughly spendable after all of my expenses / liabilities / bills are paid off.

I also have around 1000 in the moment I'm considering in investing due to the recent drop. I obviously know my position isn't perfect in life to start investing this as I have some other debts to pay, but my company is still up and running and i'm working from home so the market isn't killing me financially, and hopefully won't thankfully.

I'm looking to invest this in stocks that have had the most drops that I think will bounce back. I know it sounds like a long shot for it to work perfectly well, but stocks suck as Norwegian Cruise Lines / AMC / Royal Caribbean / Carnival / Air lines as well --- Each of these have seemed to have dropped to near 20-30% of what they were in february.

My plan is to kind of wait until they hit a bottom of near bottom again as they did last Wednesday 3/18, and then start investing as much as I can in these and similar companies. Then I plan to continue investing over the next few months to build my portfolio and continue this, rather than work on paying down my debt due to this change in the economy that I believe I can benefit more in.

If all goes well I'd imaging I would wait anywhere from 6 months to 2-3 years for the market to bounce back and then sell to collect my profit.

CAN ANYONE TELL ME IF I'M CRAZY OR IF THIS SEEMS SEMI LOGICAL? I feel like the mad scientist that hopes and thinks this can help me out in my position in life financially and give me a downpayment on a house in a few years if not more, and hopefully by then I learn a lot more and only invest better.

3. DJIA might go to 15K or lower. Only redemption here is to sit on cash and do swing trades on Pharma stocks. 

4. Job and family tensions/worries are also taking my focus away from constructing proper trades.

I've been meaning to create something like this for a long while now. I know quite a lot of you had asked me from the other day if I could share my [U.S. Indices Tracking Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EQ0Em2LOWjGDH10X57bEyUSpqCNveqi_HSTK67nlVes/edit?usp=sharing)...so I'm excited to announce that I have created a completely new spreadsheet where you guys will be able to edit in your own stock tickers into the sheet, so it's not just the default one's that you're all left with having to view in my spreadsheet.

I have never tested this out with anyone before, so I don't know if this actually works. If someone in here can confirm for me that it is working for you that would be great.

So...without getting into further ado here, I present to you all my interactive stock tracking google spreadsheet:

([CLICK HERE!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188xOIUtSoouxInBBqcP_mzJXB_Mlqz0C9W3BVdPEWQ4/edit?rm=minimal))

PLEASE NOTE: The row named ""Ticker Symbol"" is the row that is changeable. All you guys have to do here if you want to see different stocks in my spreadsheet, is to simply change the ticker symbols at the top.

I hope this is working for all of you. It admittedly did take me a bit of time to rebuild my spreadsheet from scratch again.

Of course this has tons of specifics and rating graphs that vary for each type of company that are backed by scrutinized scientific studies.There would be incentives for Well Rated companies and Badly Rated companies could go bankrupt if they don't change their behavior!  


In the food industry, the Health of humans would be taken into consideration, Ex:Organic Farms would have better rating than Monsanto or Food production companies with lots of E's and chemicals on the composition of the food's ingredients.  


Pharmaceutical companies Health Rating would drop if lot's of patients die from side effects or if they are monopolizing the market.  There could be also a World/National Resource management Live Graph(combination of a lot of different resources graph) that would take into consideration All of the Raw Materials Available and the companies that are exploiting them.    


What do you think, constructively?    


   How could we specifically improve the planet's ecosystem and human health and well-being with different types of Rating/info/Graphs about specific Companies and Countries/regions?       


How could the companies you invest be scrutinized by this new rating, in detail?

  
 How could also these new NGO Sustainability Rating Organizations take place without fear of backlashing from the Rated companies if they expose or ""whistleblow"" a companies' lack of sustainable growth or violation of the Agreements,without margin for corruption (also scrutinization of scientific studies and people and ONGs that back up the ratings), in accordance to [The Human Rights Act](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) (or an updated one) and the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) and maybe a new one for national\\global Resource Management Sharing?    


These New Ratings would also have some awkward things like How could we Eco-Rate a Military company on the welfare of a nation? On the basis that it's acting solely on the defense of individuals and not killing innocents on occupied territories?

I'm very new to investing, but due to this viruscrisis, it might be a good thing to get things kicking!  
I already did some research myself, but the first step is to find a good platform to do the trading.

[https://brokerchooser.com/best-brokers/best-stock-trading-apps-for-europeans](https://brokerchooser.com/best-brokers/best-stock-trading-apps-for-europeans)

This article makes a comparison between different trading apps.

**FreetradeUK discount broker** seems like a very good option to me;

* no stock trading fees
* no non-trading fees
* no commission
* no withdrawal fee

It does have a liimited product portfolio (only stocks and ETFs); but I;m not sure if I would need anything else than stocks as a beginner?

Are there any other reasons I'm not taking into account?

And also, the freetradeUK, would these terms be the same in Belgium (with the brexit etc.?)

If there would be any advice in investments, that's always welcome as well!

I am new to the world of investing but I think I have discovered an almost sure-fire way to make money. However, I think that this will only work if I do it right now, and I wanted to get your opinions on it before doing it. I'll just jump right into it:

VIX is known as the fear index, or volatility index. It goes up when large amounts of volatility is present in the market. At a time like now, with the coronavirus effects crashing the markets, there is unprecedented volatility - the only time VIX was this high in the past 20 years was during the 2008 crash.

Click here to see an image of the past 20 years of VIX -  [https://imgur.com/a/LHpJci3](https://imgur.com/a/LHpJci3)

Observing the behavior of VIX over the past 20 years, we can see that it does not perform at all like a stock - it doesn't go up or down over time, but rather tends to fluctuate around a ""baseline"" price of $10 - $30 throughout the entire past 20 years, occasionally seeing huge spikes up every now and then during big market crashes like this one. 

Currently, VIX is at $66. It has already gone up a tremendous amount in the past month, so it is too late to take advantage of it's INCLINE. However, I believe that it is the PERFECT time to take advantage of it's inevitable DECLINE. If you look at VIX over the past 20 years, you can see that it always returned back to it's ""baseline"" of around $10 - $30, even after the 2008 crash.

I plan to short VIX right now, at this moment in time, using an inverse VIX instrument - some of the most commonly used ones are SVXY, ZIV and EXIV. By doing so, I should be nearly-guaranteed to make a profit (unless I'm missing something) because every time that VIX spiked over the last 20 years, it ALWAYS returned to baseline.

What do you guys think of this strategy? Am I overlooking an important detail?

**I. The Death of Modern Portfolio Theory, The Loss of Risk Parity, &amp; The Liquidity Crunch**

📷

SPY 1 Yr/1 Day

Modern portfolio theory has been based on the foundational idea for the past 3 decades that both equities and bonds are inversely correlated. However, as some people have realized, both stocks and bonds are both increasing in value and decreasing in value at the same time.[\[1\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/markets-weird-coronavirus.html) This approach to investing is used pretty much in everyone's 401K, target date retirement plans, or other forms of passive investing. If both bonds and equities are losing value, what will happen to firms implementing these strategies on a more generalized basis known as risk-parity? Firms such as Bridgewater, Bluecrest, and H2O assets have been blowing up. \[[2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/dalio-s-macro-fund-plunged-about-20-this-year-as-market-tanked),[3](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-13/bluecrest-shrinks-from-relative-value-trades-amid-losses-exits)\]

Liquidity has been drying up in the markets for the past two weeks.[\[4\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/traders-nightmare-liquidity-vanished-when-they-needed-it-most) The liquidity crisis has been in the making since the 2008 financial crisis, after the passage of Dodd-Frank and Basel III. Regulations intended to regulate the financial industry have instead created the one of the largest backstops to Fed intervention as the Fed tried to pump liquidity into the market through repo operations. What is a repo?

&gt;A repo is a secured loan contract that is collateralized by a security. A repo transaction facilitates the sale and future repurchase of the security that serves as collateral between the two parties: (1) the borrower who owns a security and seeks cash and (2) the lender who receives the security as collateral when lending the cash. The cash borrower sells securities to the cash lender with the agreement to repurchase them at the maturity date. Over the course of the transaction, the cash borrower retains the ownership of the security. On the maturity date, the borrower returns the cash with interest to the lender and the collateral is returned from the lender to the borrower.[\[5\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018027pap.pdf)

Banks like Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase act as a clearing bank to provide this liquidity to other lenders through a triparty agreement.\[[6](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320634324649.pdf)\] In short, existing regulations make it unfavorable to take on additional repos due to capital reserve requirement ratios, creating a liquidity crunch.\[[7](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-12/financial-markets-need-temporary-close-like-the-one-after-9-11),[8](https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/),[9](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320634324649.pdf)\] What has the Fed done to address this in light of these facts?

&gt;In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Board has reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, the beginning of the next reserve maintenance period.[\[10\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm)

**II. Signs of Exhaustion &amp; The Upcoming Bounce is a Trap, We Have Far More to Go**

A simple indicator to use is the relative strength index (RSI) that a lot of WSB is familiar with. RSI is not the be all and end all. There's tons of indicators that also are indicating we are at a very oversold point.

📷

SPY 1 Yr/1 Day RSI

Given selling waves, there are areas of key support and resistance. For reference, I have not changed key lines since my original charts except for the colors. You can check in my previous posts. 247.94 has been critically an area that has been contested many times, as seen in the figure below. For those that bought calls during the witching day, RIP my fellow traders. The rejection of 247.94 and the continued selling below 233.86 signals to me more downside, albeit, it's getting exhausted. Thus, I expect the next area in which we start rallying is 213.

SPY 10 Day/30 min

Another contrarian indicator for buying calls is that notable people in finance have also closed their shorts. These include Jeffery Gundlach, Kevin Muir, and Raoul Pal.\[[11](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1240394134717947905),[12](https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/governments-are-panicking),[13](https://twitter.com/realvision/status/1240688338912169990)\]

**III. The Dollar, Gold, and Oil**

As previously stated, cash is being hoarded by not only primary banks, but central banks around the world. This in turn has created a boom in the dollar's strength, despite limitless injections of cash (if you think 1 trillion of Repo is the ceiling, think again) by the Fed.

📷

DXY

Despite being in a deflationary environment, the DXY has not achieved such levels since 2003. Given the dollar shortage around the world, it is not inconceivable that we reach levels of around 105-107. For disclosure, I have taken a long position in UUP. However, with all parabolic moves, they end in a large drop. To summarize, the Fed needs to take action on its own currency due to the havoc it's causing globally, and will need to crush the value of the dollar, which will likely coincide with the time that we near 180.

If we are indeed headed towards 180, then gold will keep selling off. WSB literally screams bloody guhhhhhh when gold sells off. However, gold has been having an amazing run and has broken out of its long term channel. In times of distress and with margin calls, heavy selling of equities selling off of gold in order to raise cash. As previously noted, in this deflationary environment, everything is selling off from stocks, to bonds, to gold. Thus, at this point in time, cash is king.

What about oil? Given the fall out of the risk parity structure, I'm no longer using TLT inflows/outflows as an indicator. I've realized that energy **is** the economy. Closely following commodities such as light crude which follow supply and demand more closely have provided a much better leading indicator as to what will happen in equities. Given that, oil will also most likely hit a relief rally. But ultimately, we have seen it reach as low $19/barrel during intraday trading. Oil has far lower to go.

**IV. The Next 5 Years**

In short, the recovery from this deflationary environment will take years to recover from. The trend down will not be without large bumps. We cannot compare this on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis. This is on the order of 1929. Once we hit near 180, the Fed crushes the dollar, we are in a high likelihood of hitting increased inflation, or stagflation. At this point the Fed will be backed into a corner and forced to raise rates. My targets for gold are around 1250-1300. It may possibly go near to 1000. Oil could conceivably go as low as $15-17/barrel, so don't go all in on the recovery bounce. No matter what, the current rise in gold will be a trap. The continued selling in the S&amp;P is a trap, will bounce, forming another trap, before continuing our painful downtrend.

I haven't even mentioned coronavirus and unemployment until now. I've stated previously we are on track to hit around at least 10,000 coronavirus cases by the end of this month. It's looking closer to now 20-30,000. Next month we are looking to at least 100,000 by the end of the April. We might hit 1,000,000 by May or June.

**tl;dr We're going to have a major reflexive rally starting around 213, all the way back to at least to 250, and possibly 270. WSB is going to lose their minds holding their puts, and then load up on calls, declaring we've reached a bottom in the stock market. The next move will be put in place for the next leg down to 182, where certain actors will steal all your tendies on the way down. Also Monday might be another circuit breaker.**

&gt;In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Board has reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, the beginning of the next reserve maintenance period.[\[10\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm)

**II. Signs of Exhaustion &amp; The Upcoming Bounce is a Trap, We Have Far More to Go**

A simple indicator to use is the relative strength index (RSI) that a lot of WSB is familiar with. RSI is not the be all and end all. There's tons of indicators that also are indicating we are at a very oversold point.

SPY 1 Yr/1 Day RSI

Given selling waves, there are areas of key support and resistance. For reference, I have not changed key lines since my original charts except for the colors. You can check in my previous posts. 247.94 has been critically an area that has been contested many times, as seen in the figure below. For those that bought calls during the witching day, RIP my fellow autists. The rejection of 247.94 and the continued selling below 233.86 signals to me more downside, albeit, it's getting exhausted. Thus, I expect the next area in which we start rallying is 213.

SPY 10 Day/30 min

Another contrarian indicator for buying calls is that notable people in finance have also closed their shorts. These include Jeffery Gundlach, Kevin Muir, and Raoul Pal.\[[11](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1240394134717947905),[12](https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/governments-are-panicking),[13](https://twitter.com/realvision/status/1240688338912169990)\]

**III. The Dollar, Gold, and Oil**

As previously stated, cash is being hoarded by not only primary banks, but central banks around the world. This in turn has created a boom in the dollar's strength, despite limitless injections of cash (if you think 1 trillion of Repo is the ceiling, think again) by the Fed.

📷

DXY

Despite being in a deflationary environment, the DXY has not achieved such levels since 2003. Given the dollar shortage around the world, it is not inconceivable that we reach levels of around 105-107. For disclosure, I have taken a long position in UUP. However, with all parabolic moves, they end in a large drop. To summarize, the Fed needs to take action on its own currency due to the havoc it's causing globally, and will need to crush the value of the dollar, which will likely coincide with the time that we near 180.

If we are indeed headed towards 180, then gold will keep selling off. WSB literally screams bloody guhhhhhh when gold sells off. However, gold has been having an amazing run and has broken out of its long term channel. In times of distress and with margin calls, heavy selling of equities selling off of gold in order to raise cash. As previously noted, in this deflationary environment, everything is selling off from stocks, to bonds, to gold. Thus, at this point in time, cash is king.

What about oil? Given the fall out of the risk parity structure, I'm no longer using TLT inflows/outflows as an indicator. I've realized that energy **is** the economy. Closely following commodities such as light crude which follow supply and demand more closely have provided a much better leading indicator as to what will happen in equities. Given that, oil will also most likely hit a relief rally. But ultimately, we have seen it reach as low $19/barrel during intraday trading. Oil has far lower to go.

**IV. The Next 5 Years**

In short, the recovery from this deflationary environment will take years to recover from. The trend down will not be without large bumps. We cannot compare this on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis. This is on the order of 1929. Once we hit near 180, the Fed crushes the dollar, we are in a high likelihood of hitting increased inflation, or stagflation. At this point the Fed will be backed into a corner and forced to raise rates. My targets for gold are around 1250-1300. It may possibly go near to 1000. Oil could conceivably go as low as $15-17/barrel, so don't go all in on the recovery bounce. No matter what, the current rise in gold will be a trap. The continued selling in the S&amp;P is a trap, will bounce, forming another trap, before continuing our painful downtrend.

I haven't even mentioned coronavirus and unemployment until now. I've stated previously we are on track to hit around at least 10,000 coronavirus cases by the end of this month. It's looking closer to now 20-30,000. Next month we are looking to at least 100,000 by the end of the April. We might hit 1,000,000 by May or June.

**tl;dr We're going to have a major reflexive rally starting around 213, all the way back to at least to 250, and possibly 270. WSB is going to lose their minds holding their puts, and then load up on calls, declaring we've reached a bottom in the stock market. The next move will be put in place for the next leg down to 182, where certain actors will steal all your tendies on the way down. Also Monday might be another circuit breaker.**

**tl;dr of tl;dr Big bounce incoming. Bear trap starting 213. Then bull trap up around 250-270. We're going down to around 182.**

**tl;dr of tl;dr of tl;dr WSB will be screwed both left and right before they can say guh.**

It's been a while since I've done one of these, but wanted to do a quick chat to catch everyone up on what's been going on in the market the last several weeks. With everyone on lockdown/quarantine I expect there to be a pretty big turnout (I mean really what else do we have to do?) Anyway, these last 4-5 weeks have given us some INCREDIBLE trading opportunities but things are VERY volatile and sometimes it's good to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

The session will take place **Tomorrow at 7PM Eastern** in the [**Official /r/StockMarket Discord**](https://discord.gg/p6KPJCh) and I hope you all can make it.

We'll cover some of the hottest topics of late including (but not limited to):

- The effect of COVID-19 on the market
- Airline stocks and their (possible) future
- The fall of Boeing and its (possible) future
- The recent actions of the Fed
- The current situation with COVID-19 and what to keep an eye on in the coming weeks and months

# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.
*****
&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.
*****
&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. ”$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.”
*****
&gt; # Sharp recession
&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.
*****
&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.
*****
&gt; “We’re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we’re going to get a clearer picture,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he’s watching the PMI data. “This data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it’s sell first, ask questions later.”
*****
&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.
*****
&gt; “I expect that we’ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don’t think we’re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,” said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.
*****
&gt; # More Fed Artillery
&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.
*****
&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar’s run on Friday.
*****
&gt; As the world’s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is going to be looking for indications that there’s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we’re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,” said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. “I’m watching what’s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.”
*****
&gt; # ‘Liquidity infinity’
&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.
*****
&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed’s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. “Things are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can’t take it anymore,” he said.
*****
&gt; “The amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I’m calling it,” he said. “By the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What’s the good news over the weekend? That they’re going to pass this bill? That’s already in the price.”

# How Markets Bottom

&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. “Nobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.”

&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn’t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn’t yet reflect it.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive—the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.

*****

# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds

&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook—visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases—remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.

&gt; We’re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession—almost surely coming soon—and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week—the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.

&gt; The last box—markets pricing in recession—was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.

&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; “Stocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,” noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “When comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.”

&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.

&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We know it’s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.

# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?

&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we’ll take another angle on this.

&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn’t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? “Historically we’ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That’s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.”

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.

# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear

&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.

&gt; What happens next? “Clearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We’d like to stress, we don’t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.

# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns

&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.

# Oil Slippery

&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!

&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.

# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record

&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.

# The Buck's Bounce

&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**

&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**

&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.

Hello,

I'd like to start this by saying that I already have a 6 months safety net of 10k€ and that the money I am talking about here is not money I need in the next few months/years.

I am planning on gradually buying while dollar cost averaging on my ETFs over the next few weeks/months and I wanted some insights.

I have three ETFs at the moment, separated 20% bonds, 80% stocks:

* 20% european bonds
* 40% european stocks 
* 40% worldwide stocks 

You'll notice I'm from Europe, also these ETFs do not follow any specific Index: is it better if they do (as a rule of thumb)?

I am looking into investing some more of my cash into these, as well as introducing a US stocks ETF:  
Should this US ETF follow an Index? Is it even worth it to invest in a US ETF at all when looking at my current portfolio?

It would result in 20% EU bonds and 80% stocks equally divided between themselves:  
This means that for the next few instalments, the US ETF would receive proportionally more cash than the others to catch up to them.

I was thinking of spreading the investment, 4 buys at a rate of 1 every two weeks, and then regularly invest (thinking of once per quarter at the moment) in the same ETFs:  
Is bi-monthly OK, too short between the buys, too long? Is quarterly after that valid, or would it be better to follow a different time frame?

For these 4 buys we speak of 8k€, then for the quarterly buy, it would range between 1.5 and 2.5k€, so not so much all in all.

Well F or Ford motors has been on my eye for over a year now.
Honestly haven't even been watching the last two weeks as everything continues to free fall.
Then handing out free money to everyone?
This reeks of recession which I saw signs of 6+ months ago but back to the point..
Ford closed at $4.33 with after hours trading pushing $4.35..
Let me say I would never own a Ford..
Not my style..
But this stock is going to push ahead again...
I'm telling you, I even made a $50 bet that Ford will unveil a Tesla like model before the end of 2023.
Buffet logical point here.
Ford is embedded into America.
Known in all states, every home, I'd put money that every American has seen, spoke the word, and knows someone who owns one.
We all know how the roller-coaster of a market we all have to endure from time to time.
Jump in during the dip.
Ford may go to $2 but, every week I'm going to accumulate a few more.
Yes Dividends are suspended.
Yes they halted production like the majority of the planet right now.
But when we come back,
It's always stronger.

&gt;A bearish “death cross” pattern has appeared in the Dow Jones  Industrial Average’s chart for the first time in over a year, which is a  warning of further losses in the near term.  
&gt;  
&gt;But recent history suggests the pattern might not be the death  knell for the stock market that the name implies, as the past two death  crosses appeared much closer to the bottom than the previous top.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dow         [DJIA,          -4.54%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote)dropped 365 points, or 1.8%, in afternoon trading Friday, and has now [dropped 33%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-will-fall-into-a-bear-market-if-the-dow-and-sp-500-close-below-these-levels-2020-03-09?mod=article_inline)  since closing at a record 29,551.42 on Feb. 12 amid growing fears of  the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Dow is set to stretch  its streak of not producing back-to-back gains to six weeks. [Read Market Snapshot](https://www.marketwatch.com/search?mod=article_inline).  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dow’s 50-day moving average fell to 27,109.77 from  27,290.53, according to FactSet, while the 200-day moving average is at  27,152.64, down from 27,184.16.  
&gt;  
&gt;A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average (DMA),  which many chart watchers use as a short-term trend tracker, crosses  below the 200-DMA, which is widely viewed as a dividing line between  longer-term uptrends and downtrends. The idea is the cross marks the  spot that a shorter-term selloff transitions to a longer-term downtrend.  
&gt;  
&gt;Crosses aren’t necessarily good market-timing indicators, however, as  they are well telegraphed, but they can help put a selloff in  historical perspective.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dow’s last death cross appeared on Dec. 19, 2018, after the  Dow had dropped 13.1% from its then-record close on Oct. 3, 2018. The  Dow bottomed just three days later on Dec. 24 at 21,792.20, or 6.6%  below the Dec. 19 close.

&gt;  
&gt;The one before that appeared on Jan. 13, 2016, after falling  9.9% from its Nov. 3, 2015 peak. The Dow fell another 3.0% before  bottoming four weeks later, on Feb. 11.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not all death crosses appeared in the later innings of the selloff.  The one that appeared on Aug. 11, 2015 followed a 5.0% decline from its  then-record close three months earlier; the Dow fell another 10.0% in  two weeks before bottoming.

If I switch to a margin account, what happens to my current long stock positions? Do they stay as cash investments? or does part of the position become borrowed assets and become subject to margin/borrowing interest fees?

Does TD Ameritrade differentiate which equities were purchased with margin? If I'm about to make a purchase on margin, does the application warn me first?

If i place a buy order with unsettled funds then a day later I have enough funds settled to cover the cost of the buy order, does it get converted back to a cash purchase? Or does it remain a borrowed amount/subject to margin interest?

I understand my Robinhood account is a margin account because I can trade with unsettled funds. I've also never been charged interest on my account holdings as far as I'm aware? I really want to start using TD as my main brokerage, so I'm hoping it works the same as RH in this regard?

First of all, English is not my native language, so I'm sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes.

Secondly, I thank you all in advance for anyone reading and responding to this post.

So here is a summary of my actual situation :

- I have a stable salary which is not by any means threatened by the current pandemic.
- I'm 26 years old and I just finished school a year ago. I have more or less 60K on the stock market actually (in mutual funds) 
- I actually invest, weekly, in mutual funds, 300 $. I do not need this money on short term. This is planned to be used in 30 years or so. 
- I do not have any loans, actually, other than my mortgage. 

So here is my question :

Considering the recent drop of the markets, should I take a loan of 50K to invest in mutual funds, composed mainly of a variety of stocks (mainly USA and Canada)?

Before everyone tells me that ""you shouldn't invest money you don't have"", I just want to point out that the 300$ weekly payment will not, by any means, compromised my ""personal life"". This 300$ is actually weekly invest, so using it to pay the loan will not change my ""cash flow"". If I do not use it to pay for the loan, I would simply invest it. Theoretically, I could lose all the money invested and would have no problem paying back the loan. This is not the classic situation of using ""leverage"" to invest money you can't afford. I will have no problem paying back the loan, no matter the investments performance. 

I was thinking about investing this 50k over the next 10 months or so (invest 5K monthly). This is based on the idea that we cannot time the market and the incredible volatility of the stock market. I think that investing it on several months limits my risk. I might be wrong. 

I have the opportunity to have a loan at at variable rate of 3,6% (linked with my mortgage). I do understand that this rate will likely go up, but still seems reasonable to me.

I would use the 300 $ that I normally used to invest weekly to pay for the loan. The loan should be completely paid in about 4 years, more or less.

Indirectly, I'm just investing 50K in the next 10 months or so, by using a loan that will be reimbursed by the weekly 300$ I used to invest, instead of simply investing 300$ weekly. 

Thank to all redditers who took the time to read this post.

The dangers of this looming recession are amplified by a double edged sword of a supply and demand side shock on a swollen oil sector within the US. As oil becomes practically worthless, people may in tandem demand far less oil than they did in a pre-virus world. This could bankrupt some US oil companies pulling the financial system into turmoil as overexposed banks struggle under the flow of bad debt. 

The US government, and the Federal Reserve have attempted to step in and lessen the blow. But neither the Fed or the gov’t can stop people from selling their stocks. Now I have no doubt of the possible power of the Fed to inject cheap money to prop up a market for sometime. But as we saw with the British Sterling collapse in 1992 gov’t cannot stop a falling market. The gov’t can’t save us, and neither can the Federal Reserve. Banks won’t lend in risky markets, and people won’t buy stocks.

Now where does this leave your portfolio in the coming months? If you got out early and are sitting in cash now great! If not, I think you still have time to save this. I do not believe the virus will be quite as bad as anticipated for two reasons, fear and excitement are the mind killers, and other countries have managed to recover. Many many a time have people heralded the end of the world, and yet we are still here. The virus will end, and the markets will recover, but this doesn’t mean I don’t think they have farther to fall, things can get ugly in the coming months. Nassim Nicholas Taleb once synthesized his entire book Fooled by Randomness into one sentence: “Humans react to risks that are tangible and easily understood, they don’t react to the intangible and not easily understood” I believe these markets have further to fall once the risk of this virus becomes more concrete and present in peoples social circles, not just a virus that news will not stop talking about. People will only get more scared when this happens, and we could see some major liquidations. So with my own perspective in mind where do you go from here? Two places, either you go short the market(though I recommend not doing this with your entire portfolio), or you wait. Patience is probably one of the single most if not the most important aspect of being a successful investor. There are serious opportunities developing in US oil, Tesla(though this is my more speculative choice), and Airlines. There is a lot of value in these companies that eventually will be realized when things settle back down. I think this opportunity is forming but soon when things get even worse it will have materialized entirely Those who have held onto there portfolio through this downward spike, I think selling off some to take advantage of the value being created right now would be wise. For those in cash wait, or go short, just make sure you can capitalize on the value being created right now in some damaged sectors.

Knowing one’s own emotions is crucial when dealing in equity markets. I know that I am excitable and usually have entered positions to early. This introspection allows me to force myself to wait even though every fiber of my body cries out buy. Fortunes will be made by those who were on the right side of this crisis and those who bought near the bottom.

&gt;Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) reported the first sale of stock jointly owned by her and her husband on Jan. 24, the very day that her committee, the Senate Health Committee, hosted a private, all-senators briefing from administration officials, including the CDC director and Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institutes of Health of the United States, on the coronavirus. 

&gt;“Appreciate today’s briefing from the President’s top health officials on the novel coronavirus outbreak,” she tweeted about the briefing at the time.

&gt;That first transaction was a sale of stock in the company Resideo Technologies worth between $50,001 and $100,000. The company’s stock price has fallen by more than half since then, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average overall has shed approximately 10,000 points, dropping about a third of its value.

&gt;It was the first of 29 stock transactions that Loeffler and her husband made through mid-February, all but two of which were sales. One of Loeffler’s two purchases was stock worth between $100,000 and $250,000 in Citrix, a technology company that offers teleworking software and which has seen a small bump in its stock price since Loeffler bought in as a result of coronavirus-induced market turmoil.

The other day I purchased a good bit of VTSAX  (it's one of the few options my 401k provider offers) thinking we we're close to the floor. Today I started to second guess and wanted to sell on the small rise before the next dip.  I quickly realized there was no easy way to do this and be well informed about it.  

As an example, there are 3521 stocks in the VTSAX portfolio. The fund is bought/sold once a day at the close of business. I tried looking at the charts but there really isn't one. There's just a series of lines based on the close of each day. It makes it tough to read whether or not the fund will close up or down, at least for me. So I got to thinking... what if...

By trade, I'm a software developer. It wouldn't be difficult to build a collection of stocks, ping an API, either by time or click, and find each price/percentage of each stock in the collection to find the overall performance of the fund at any given time during the day.

Chimera had already granted the executives their yearly awards in January and February but then decided to make a 3rd grant in March (which has never been done before), with no explanation, and at prices 55% below their stock price just 1 month ago (and below their closing price on March 18th, the day the awards were granted).

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim?ltr=1):

&gt;Chimera Investment Corporation operates as a real estate investment trust in the United States. The company, through its subsidiaries, invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities secured by pools of commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and other real estate related securities.

First things first, like many companies, Chimera has been crushed by the market over the last month (-55%). They also were having an extremely rough day on March 18th with the stock bottoming out at $6.50, 47% below the opening price. However, the stock rebounded back up to $9.98 (18% below the opening price) after they put out a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200318005591/en/) basically saying that they have repurchased $22M of shares since announcing a $150M buyback plan five days ago, that they have the technology for all of their employees to work effectively from home, and that their executives and directors have been purchasing stock.

📷

Looking at their [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1409493&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) activity, we don’t yet see any executives or directors purchasing any stock, but we do see a whole bunch of stock grants being awarded to most of their executives and one of their directors. It is possible that their purchasing activity just hasn’t yet been posted by the SEC, so we will keep an eye out for that.

📷

Stock grants on their own aren’t unusual, but it is unusual to grant stock for a 3rd time in Q1 when the company has never done that before and is near its all-time low. Looking at Matthew Lambiase’s (CEO) [grants](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getowner&amp;CIK=0001419165) for the last few years, we see that he (and the other executives) typically receive stock grants in either January or February (or both) but never in March.

📷

Digging a little deeper into the awards, we find that everyone except the Chief Legal Officer received pretty substantial 6-figure award amounts. With the closing price on March 18th being $9.98, these executives/directors also received some pretty nice discounts on their grants.

The individual Form 4s that are generally granted in January and February show that Chimera is normally awarding RSUs (probably a yearly bonus) and occasionally PSUs (performance shares that vest in mid-February if performance goals are reached).

However, the [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000115752320000373/xslF345X03/form4.xml)s for the grants that were just awarded give no explanation as to why these awards were granted. This is definitely unusual considering they have never awarded a 3rd stock grant in the same year (let alone the same quarter).

📷

As a side note, Choudhary Yarlagadda’s (COO) [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000115752320000376/xslF345X03/form4.xml) shows that his spouse is actually the one receiving the 40,600 shares. I’m not sure why this would be, but if anyone has any info about it please share!

If you read their [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000120677419001325/cim3506171-def14a.htm), you will see that the executives do have ownership guidelines that require the CEO to hold 5x his salary in stock and the other executives to hold 3x their salary in stock while the directors must hold 5x their retaining bonus. However, as the table below shows, all of them are well above their required holdings except for the Chief Legal Officer who is substantially below his requirements. However, they gave the Chief Legal Officer much less stock than everyone else and not nearly enough to put him over his requirements (we did not include the stock they were just granted on March 18th and made the stock price the same as their grant price). While it is possible that they were granting this stock to ensure that all of the executives and directors stay above their ownership requirements, it seems highly unlikely.

## Conclusion

These stock grants check a lot of boxes for an “unusual award”. The executives had already received their yearly rewards, they gave no explanation for this award, they granted the stock near the lowest prices possible, and the awards weren’t necessary to push the executives over their ownership guidelines.

There is the possibility that this is them just putting on a show to try to prevent their stock from declining further, but it would be a fairly pricey show especially when you consider the $155M of share repurchases they are doing.

There is another possibility that this is just a retention grant to keep their execs around.

A third, potentially more likely, possibility is that the company and executives believe the stock is undervalued and they are grabbing the stock at a discount.

We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our ""dip"".

I detailed trouble for oil industry and oil communities, needed government policies (bailouts, stimulus, helicopter money to consumers), hidden losers like casinos (will be trading cents on the dollar) and private prisons, etc. All of this developed literally within days after the thread was posted.

This will be my third post in this series but it will be a brief post:

I believe that the market decline is quickly coming into sight because we have increasing evidence of efficacy of various widely available drugs in treating covid19.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/186Bel9RqfsmEx55FDum4xY_IlWSHnGbj/view

This is the latest peer review study showing that drugs like hydroxychloroquine has been shown to cure (test negative) 90% of patients after 6 days vs 96% still positive for virus after 6 days in the control group.

This builds on what we've seen reported in countries around the world:

- China just approved chloroquine, an old drug to treat malaria, as an effective treatment of nCov. https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202002%2F17%2FWS5e4a436be4b00949486814d8.html&amp;sandbox=1

- ""It would be a medical mistake not to give chloroquine against the Chinese virus"" Didier Raoult, expertscape #1 expert on communicable diseases. https://www.20minutes.fr/sante/2727411-20200226-coronavirus-faute-medicale-donner-chloroquine-contre-virus-chinois-selon-professeur-didier-raoult

- Included in both the Chinese and Korean treatment recommendations https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074550 http://m.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7428

- hydroxychloroquine seems to work too ""20 patients with new crown pneumonia as of February 17th. The clinical symptoms of patients with 1-2 days were improved significantly after treatment with hydroxychloroquine. After 5 days of use, 19 cases of chest CT showed significant improvement in absorption"" https://www.jqknews.com/news/388543-The_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_has_short_term_curative_effect_on_the_treatment_of_new_crown_pneumonia.html

- earlier update on 21 Feb of 135 cases that generally got better http://www.china.org.cn/china/2020-02/22/content_75732846.htm

- One of the top french specialist on the subject announced that chloroquine might be the medicament we needed and results from the tests in china are amazing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L6ehRif-v8

So here's some info on what's happening:

Drugs like Chloroquine works in treating the virus because they are Zinc Ionophores. Zinc inhibits viral reproduction but zinc has a hard time making it past our cell walls. Zinc ionophores solves this problem and has been shown to work for other viral infections as well.

Data coming out of countries like China and South Korea shows that case fatality rates dropped immensely after adopting widespread use of these drugs. France is following their lead and the data coming out of France in the coming weeks will help confirm the efficacy of using zinc ionophores.

Chinese data are rightfully criticized for being unreliable, but South Korea's case fatality rate is an order of magnitude lower than countries like Italy where the zinc ionophores has not been reported being widely used.

The discovery of this existing cheap and widely available treatment is what will help return us to normal. The next step will be a rushed vaccine by the next flu season to hopefully permanently put covid19 behind us.

I should note that the early studies have ""flawed"" methodologies. The most recent peer reviewed study has a very small sample size. But this is the nature of emergency crisis situations. You need to use incomplete and often flawed data, apply a giant margin of safety on it, and then draw conclusion about what will likely develop.

My opinion is that there has been enough data to show that we can probably dramatically decrease the scary case fatality rate to something manageable. All studies are showing the efficacy of these drugs and CFR data from countries using these treatments show drastically fewer deaths.

Another good news is that my feared ""paradigm shift"" may be alleviated as well. I warned that the most important news to look for is the mutations of this virus. This virus's spreading characteristics makes it very unlikely evolutionary pressures will heavily favor more benign versions of the virus. This is because other viruses like SARS burn out quickly and prevent its own transmissions. They show symptoms too quickly and kill too quickly making it easy to detect/contain. This virus with its multiweek asymptomatic spread means the deadliness of it will not be easily selected out through evolutionary process. So it can evolve deadlier strains and propagated almost as easily as it can evolve more benign strains.

And with rapid mutation of new strains, this will hamper efforts to vaccinate against it.

However, with zinc ionophores, we may have a more general treatment option that will work on subsequent mutations and strains. This may help us stomp the virus out and prevent a paradigm shifting reality where we have ""seasonal flus"" of various strains of covid19 that kills 15x-20x more people than our current seasonal flus.

Once news of this starts circulating through America, and more data comes out of countries like France, I believe that the market will reach its bottom.

I should note that there are a lot of ""lagging indicators"" like unemployment that will continue to worsen for months after the market finishes nose diving. Just because the market bounces back doesn't mean a lot of layoffs, bankruptcies, and foreclosures won't continue to happen.

For this third post, I had originally wanted to create a thorough discussion on the 35 or so crucial leading indicators I believe will predict and even pin point he exact turning point in our financial markets. There are some fascinating data points from other countries/regions/industries that leads our financial market remarkably consistently. But I have repeatedly warned against using models based on previous crises to predict what will happen with this virus because of its unique and unprecedented effect on our markets. We can't use past models of previous diseases to model this because those previous diseases have vastly different characteristics (rates regarding spread, hospitalization, death, effect on economic actors). So I'll put those leading indicators off for now and stick with my original thesis. We almost certainly have the treatment now, the next step is a vaccine before the next flu season.

Chimera had already granted the executives their yearly awards in January and February but then decided to make a 3rd grant in March (which has never been done before), with no explanation, and at prices 55% below their stock price just 1 month ago (and below their closing price on March 18th, the day the awards were granted).

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim?ltr=1):

&gt;Chimera Investment Corporation operates as a real estate investment trust in the United States. The company, through its subsidiaries, invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities secured by pools of commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and other real estate related securities.

First things first, like many companies, Chimera has been crushed by the market over the last month (-55%). They also were having an extremely rough day on March 18th with the stock bottoming out at $6.50, 47% below the opening price. However, the stock rebounded back up to $9.98 (18% below the opening price) after they put out a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200318005591/en/) basically saying that they have repurchased $22M of shares since announcing a $150M buyback plan five days ago, that they have the technology for all of their employees to work effectively from home, and that their executives and directors have been purchasing stock.

📷

Looking at their [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1409493&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) activity, we don’t yet see any executives or directors purchasing any stock, but we do see a whole bunch of stock grants being awarded to most of their executives and one of their directors. It is possible that their purchasing activity just hasn’t yet been posted by the SEC, so we will keep an eye out for that.

📷

Stock grants on their own aren’t unusual, but it is unusual to grant stock for a 3rd time in Q1 when the company has never done that before and is near its all-time low. Looking at Matthew Lambiase’s (CEO) [grants](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getowner&amp;CIK=0001419165) for the last few years, we see that he (and the other executives) typically receive stock grants in either January or February (or both) but never in March.

📷

Digging a little deeper into the awards, we find that everyone except the Chief Legal Officer received pretty substantial 6-figure award amounts. With the closing price on March 18th being $9.98, these executives/directors also received some pretty nice discounts on their grants.

The individual Form 4s that are generally granted in January and February show that Chimera is normally awarding RSUs (probably a yearly bonus) and occasionally PSUs (performance shares that vest in mid-February if performance goals are reached).

However, the [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000115752320000373/xslF345X03/form4.xml)s for the grants that were just awarded give no explanation as to why these awards were granted. This is definitely unusual considering they have never awarded a 3rd stock grant in the same year (let alone the same quarter).

As a side note, Choudhary Yarlagadda’s (COO) [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000115752320000376/xslF345X03/form4.xml) shows that his spouse is actually the one receiving the 40,600 shares. I’m not sure why this would be, but if anyone has any info about it please share!

If you read their [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000120677419001325/cim3506171-def14a.htm), you will see that the executives do have ownership guidelines that require the CEO to hold 5x his salary in stock and the other executives to hold 3x their salary in stock while the directors must hold 5x their retaining bonus. However, as the table below shows, all of them are well above their required holdings except for the Chief Legal Officer who is substantially below his requirements. However, they gave the Chief Legal Officer much less stock than everyone else and not nearly enough to put him over his requirements (we did not include the stock they were just granted on March 18th and made the stock price the same as their grant price). While it is possible that they were granting this stock to ensure that all of the executives and directors stay above their ownership requirements, it seems highly unlikely.

## Conclusion

These stock grants check a lot of boxes for an “unusual award”. The executives had already received their yearly rewards, they gave no explanation for this award, they granted the stock near the lowest prices possible, and the awards weren’t necessary to push the executives over their ownership guidelines.

There is the possibility that this is them just putting on a show to try to prevent their stock from declining further, but it would be a fairly pricey show especially when you consider the $155M of share repurchases they are doing.

Another, potentially more likely, possibility is that the company and executives believe the stock is undervalued and they are grabbing the stock at a discount.

I’m torn (as I’m sure many are) as to what my strategy should be given recent market losses and vol. My portfolio is basic - SPY and AGG, with a few others (REITs and Dividend ETFs). I also have SPY puts on as a hedge, but not enough to counter recent losses.

What’s the prevailing opinion these days - sell these positions at lows to move to cash given uncertainty or hold onto them in preparation for what is hopefully a market recovery in the coming months (timeline is obviously debatable).

I’ve pretty much hit my risk tolerance with recent market losses, so now is the time to decide on sticking it out or running for the hills.

We’re nearing the end of the selloff. There is nothing more to selloff. It’s ugly already.

Major upcoming events:
1. Stimulus package and the short squeeze. It maybe will rebound to the early 20K and will stagnate for a few months with slow recovery

2. Vaccine/drug news: Gilead or Glaxxo or JNJ will have some form of drug out (remdesivir and chloroquine and other HIV drugs are reportedly working). We will be in phase 1 clinical trials by April, May. Google the vaccine life cycle or phase 1. 2 and 3. I am betting people will want to accelerate that life cycle

3. The only unknown parameter is how fast America can lessen new infections. South Korea and China have done it

The selloff is already pricing in 2 to 3 quarters of contraction and recession 

The only silver lining here is that this is a forced recession and it’s good because Wall Street was on steroids and another 2008 style institution induced market collapse would be far more disastrous than the  ongoing sellof",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,350287,public,confidence,self,"I’m calling 18,000 DOW as the bottom",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fl85ak/im_calling_18000_dow_as_the_bottom/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I made the mistake of investing too much of my money into the markets (80%)+ and now with the markets crashing I am stuck bag holding. I have some stocks which were speculative and I lost a bunch on but that's ok I was prepared for that. In the end I just put too much of my savings into the markets and now I'm stressed seeing the markets down each day. I wasn't aware of my risk tolerance and obviously going through this I know that I should invest more then 50% of my money. With the 20% left it's my emergency fund So I can't buy incredibly cheap stocks right now unfortunately.

We're gonna break this down into 4 parts.

Let's start with the virus.

**Part 1 - The Virus**

Now, this virus.

First of all, I just want as a disclaimer to say that it's important to rely on official sources of information regarding the virus since they would never lie to you...

OK, so what's up? Well, here's what's up:

This virus is the trigger for the biggest power play we've seen since 2001.

This is a perfect excuse for an economic crash.

This defers responsibility from those who are actually responsible and blames it all on this virus.

It also accelerates the inevitable trend towards a cashless society, and the much desired Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

We've had [Christine Lagarde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chHnk6lSc5A) (former head of the IMF and current President of the ECB) and [Mark Carney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPgWAWNyqMU) (former Governor for the Bank of England and current UN special envoy on climate action and climate finance) speak on digital currencies.

We've had reports from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The BIS is essentially the Central Bank for Central Banks.

Coincidence is a funny thing (just ask Larry Silverstein...):

In 2019, 1200 CEOs left their positions. That was a record year.

In the first month of 2020, 219 CEOs left. A new record.

On the topic of CEOs...

**Part 2 - CEOs and Stock Buybacks**

The financial metrics which incentivise executives have become far removed from operating performance.

As an example, [here is a story from the end of 2014.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-buybacks-pay/)..

This summarises perfectly what has happened!

The main source of demand for equities has been corporations (i.e.stock buybacks).

And this makes sense, incentives drive human behaviour. Pretty simple.

Now, *this* is the really infuriating part.

These corporations now want bailouts.

By the way, this will happen.

And just like '08, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.

The Airlines, which feel they are entitled to bailouts, [spent 96% of their free cash flow on stock buybacks over the past decade](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/airline-bailout-coronavirus-share-buyback-debate-trump-economy-aoc-2020-3-1029006175).

Now they want a bailout. Ridiculous!

**Part 3 - Encryption and Privacy**

While all of this is going on, the US Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption and it's been [working it's way through Congress](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/12/21174815/earn-it-act-encryption-killer-lindsay-graham-match-group).

This concerns the EARN IT Act.

The premise of the bill is that technology companies have to earn Section 230 protections rather than being granted immunity by default, as the Communications Decency Act has provided for over two decades.

If the EARN IT Act were passed, tech companies could be held liable if their users posted illegal content. When internet companies become liable for what their users post, those companies *aggressively moderate speech*.

**Part 4 - Practicality**

Central Bank Digital Currencies are inevitable.

The NSA created the SHA-256 algorithm in 2001.

The NSA could of stopped Bitcoin early on if it truly wanted to (51% attack for example).

Why NOW allow a decentralised network of value transfer to develop, whereas previous attempts were snuffed out?

Well, going back to central banking: how about a centralised Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that will allow a greater level of control, can facilitate negative interest rates, easier collection of taxes, etc.

For this to work, you need to usher it in gradually such that people have a decentralised alternative (i.e. BTC) and the mass public is more receptive to digital currencies more broadly. So BTC is the gold and CBDC is the ‘new fiat’.

The current situation is pretty chaotic.

His rags to riches story made him an influential person. Using his good reputation, he started taking loans from his friends using made up collateral and gambled it.

Initially, he earned huge profits but later in his quest to conquer the world, he incurred huge losses. It was unfortunate for him that the banks also discovered the fake collaterals that he deposited. Gaurav was left with nothing but bankruptcy. 

This story can be used to understand the infamous **‘Harshad Mehta Scam’.** Harshad belonged from a Gujarati family. He did his graduation in commerce from Lajpatrai College, Mumbai and showed keen interest in the stock market. After working for various brokerage firms, he became a member of the Bombay Stock Exchange and then soon established his own firm to be known as GrowMore Research and Asset Management. 

#### What was the scam about? 

Back in those days when the Indian stock market was still in its structural phase, banks were supposed to invest in government bonds through a broker. Exploiting his powerful position, Mehta became the broker of various such banks who issued the cheques for buying securities under his name.

He then invested the amount in the stock market and created an artificial demand for some stocks by investing heavily into them. He single-handedly rose the shares of ACC by a whopping 4400% in about 3 months. After earning profits, he used to pass on the nominal value to banks, keeping all the profits for himself.

Life was good for Mehta. Business magazines started hailing him and media portrayed him as ‘The Big Bull.’ He lived a lavish life and owned flashy cars. It was the morning of 23 April 1992 that shook his life. Journalist Sucheta Dalal exposed his unethical and unlawful tactics of buying and the prodigy of the Indian stock market was charged with 600 civil action suits and 72 criminal cases. Soon banks started asking their money back and that ended the bull phase in the Indian markets and created a downfall. 

#### Aftermath

The Harshad Mehta scam led to an immediate collapse in the Indian stock market as it scared a lot of investors who started withdrawing their money. Potential investors also refrained themselves from entering stock markets as this scam created a sceptical image of the same. Numerous banks suffered a lot, including Vijaya Bank, whose chairman committed suicide after the outbreak. 

Harshad Mehta was then charged by the Bombay High Court, which estimated USD 740 million on account of his fraud.

Mehta also addressed the media in which he confessed about donating Rs 1 crore to then Prime Minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao for clearing his charges. Securities and Exchange Board of India banned him from the stock market and related activities for life. Harshad Mehta died on 31 December 2001 at Thane Hospital, Mumbai after complaining of chest pain. More than 27 cases were still pending at that time. 

While the story of Gaurav remains an inspiration for many of us to work hard and be determined towards our goals, it also reminds us that resorting to unethical and unlawful means brings nothing but misery.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,350196,public,confidence,self,Unfolding the Harshad Mehta Scam,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fl6ewb/unfolding_the_harshad_mehta_scam/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is all Corona coverage in the media just a cover story for the upcoming super long recession?

Most poeple who don't trade daily have not noticed the stock market crash that lost 35% of its value in the past 8 days while they were busy reading scary Corona updates while in line trying to get their TP ration from Costco. 

Corona is very serious, and should NOT be taken lightly, and it will be extremely  important for about 2 months, BUT, it seems to have overshadowed much bigger news with much deeper impact on our lives which is the fact that all of Trump's stock market gains have wiped out as of today Mar 18 and futures are showing another 800 point drop tomorrow. Most services and products have already gone up as a result of the recent years' inflation.

We could be looking at 5 to 8 years of recession, imagine no jobs, foreclosures like it's 2009 all over again. This could be a lot longer than 1987, 1994, 2001 and 2008 because, instead of having a small correction in 2017 to allow for a stronger emergence of the market, the market was pumped and pumped for 3.5 years just to bust in 8 days. Didn't even last through re-election.

And if you think stock market doesn't impact you because you have such and such recession proof job, there is no such thing.

I'm not Rep or Dem by the way and this is NOT a partisan issue. Just strictly observation of the market realities behind the scary Corona virus that most will forget by June. Yet the recession will be there.

And the more fed aid they give such as 0% interest , $1000 checks, 1.5 trillion SB loans, the more we get deep into recession.

Looking at SNAP now and how it's been acting for the past few days and it seems like it could take a fat dip starting from this week into next week but as I watched it today it felt very resistant.

The question is very simple. It has been hardly a week and a half since traffic started getting affected for the airlines. We don't know how long it might take to ""flatten the curve"" but it can be within a month in the most optimistic calculation. 

Are we honestly saying that the biggest airlines, posting billions of dollars of profit cannot weather a couple of months without financial help? And again, to reiterate, it's only been 2 weeks since we started talking about covid-19 and travel got affected and we're potentially bailing these companies out tomorrow.

I have looked into terminology, different markets, equities, CFDs, Forex etc. I have concluded that shorting anything is a bad idea for me at this point (plus I don't really have a complete handle on the logistics of setting up a margin account and actually completing a short transaction).

I'm thinking the market is falling, and I will initially have about £1000 to invest. (More available as I earn)

I have been considering investing in Tesla stock as I note it is getting cheaper by the day, and I'm expecting it to level out soon enough - to the point where I was thinking of buying a few shares shortly.

This was my plan as I'm trying to keep it simple to start with, and it seems like a stable investment to go long with for the coming months. 

My question(s) is/are- 
Is his a reasonable first investment?
Am I missing something and making a mistake?
Any advice on alternative first investments/different routes?

Any other comments/suggestions would be muchly appreciated!
