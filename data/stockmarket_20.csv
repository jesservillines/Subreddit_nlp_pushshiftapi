Suppose your 401k is doing great, because you had allocated a good share in domestic stock funds offered by Blackrock, fidelity and Schwab.....

.... and you are aware that stocks cannot keep going higher and higher.....

..... and you know a trump recession is definitely coming and the coronavirus triggered China slowdown can accelerate it faster 

...... and Europe in perennial slump (look at their stoxx bank index)

Does any of you plan to take motivating measures by looking at bond funds and treasuries? I want to hear your next steps.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020.

# **Stocks expected to rise even as virus creates volatility: ‘The market thinks the worst is over’  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/stocks-expected-to-rise-even-as-virus-creates-volatility-the-market-thinks-the-worst-is-over.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to remain hostage to developments involving the coronavirus in the week ahead, and even so, the market could continue to hit new highs.
*****
&gt; Economists have been reducing China’s growth outlook for the quarter, with some seeing little or no growth and then a bounce back in the high single digits next quarter. The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.
*****
&gt; “It does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there’s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can’t believe what’s coming out of China.”
*****
&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. “The market didn’t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There’s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,” he said.
*****
&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday’s Empire State and Thursday’s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.
*****
&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.
*****
&gt; # Profit warnings
&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.
*****
&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.
*****
&gt; “This is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains” and exporters, said Keon. “It will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn’t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.”
*****
&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.
*****
&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.
*****
&gt; “There will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,” Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.
*****
&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.
*****
&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. “Could we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,” he said.
*****
&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. “It trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,” he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.
*****
&gt; # Resilient market
&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there’s more clarity on the virus.
*****
&gt; “I had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we’re there,” said Sluymer. “I don’t have a year-end target but I think it’s higher. I think we’re in a sloppy range. I think it’s range bound.”
*****
&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. “Stocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,” he said.
*****
&gt; Keon said he’s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. “I think it’s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year. But that’s the way we have our portfolios positioned — the market will work its way higher this year,” he said.

# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 12 of Last 14

&gt; February’s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 26 years with an average loss of 0.20% for S&amp;P 500. Despite a bumpy finish, expiration week as a whole has fared better, but nets an average gain of just 0.47% on the S&amp;P 500 since 1994 with 17 of 26 winning weeks. More recently, S&amp;P 500 has advanced in twelve of the last fourteen options expiration weeks. The week after, has been down 13 of the last 26 years. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar patterns over the same timeframe.

# Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Still Weak

&gt; Yesterday’s post, showed improvement the two days before Presidents’ Day Weekend the past 10 years. But the two days after still display a lot of red. Since 1990 Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 12 losses for median gain of 0.14% and an average loss of –0.22%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is net loser down 18 of 30 years with and average loss of –0.50% and a median loss of –0.21%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has greater magnitude of decline. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 30 with an average loss of –0.08% and a median decline of –0.16%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 30, average –0.04%, median –0.11% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 30, average –0.04%, median –0.14%.

# Closer Look At February

&gt; A late month selloff in January saw the S&amp;P 500 Index close marginally lower for the month. But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.

&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn’t be a total surprise? “Yes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Yet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.” In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October’s gain of 2.29%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/february-is-usually-weak-but-has-been-the-best-month-the-past-10-years.png?ssl=1))**

# A Record Pace of Records

&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.

# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap

&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.

&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**

&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**

&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.

# Things Are Looking Up

&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.

&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER
&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren’t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.

&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS
&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don’t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.

&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS
&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.

# Another ""Delay"" in the Value Trade

&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of ""The time for value stocks to outperform is now."" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**

&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.

&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.

&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.

So I quit my job and my new employer doesn’t offer 401k. 
So should I rollover my previous 401k into an ira? If so  I don’t plan on contributing bc I think I make over the threshold for deduction.

The same pattern this time tells that it would go down to at least 1200. Now you can only pray and hope im wrong. But if im right then see you after the crash. Good news is that it will eventually come back to where it was and continue going further up. Unless the american economy loses its immortality lol. No wonder buffet is sitting around with cash now.

That’s how Mark Spitznagel, the founder of Universa Investments, described his approach to navigating market risk in [**an interview with Vanity Fair**](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/02/nassim-taleb-protege-on-how-to-prepare-for-coming-market-crash) that published Thursday. Basically, he says he makes far out-of-the-money bets that cost little but deliver huge when it all comes crashing down.

“Really explosive downside protection is really the only risk mitigation that’s able to move the needle for people, because it’s the only risk mitigation that doesn’t cost you as you are waiting for it to happen,” Spitznagel said. “When the market crashes, I want to make a whole lot and when the market doesn’t crash, I want to lose a teeny, teeny amount. I want that asymmetry... that convexity.”

In other words, his fund provides crash insurance so his clients can take on more “systemic risk” with their other investments.

Spitznagel, a former trader, is a protégé of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the author of the 2007 bestseller, “The Black Swan,” which is a metaphor used to describe unpredictable, highly disruptive events — the kind that could blow up markets.

Right now, stocks, with the Federal Reserve winds blowing at their backs, are “distorted” and “no longer tethered to fundamentals,” Spitznagel warns, and that makes for those chasing returns extremely vulnerable.

“These monetary distortions lead to this reckless reach for yields that we are all seeing,” he said. “Randomly go look at a screen and it’s pretty crazy. Big caps, small-caps, credit markets, volatility; it’s crazy. Reach for yield is everywhere.”

Spitznagel explained to Vanity Fair that, at this point, **central bankers have lost control and don’t know how to right their wrongs.**

“They will never be able to ‘normalize’ rates,” he said. “In our lifetime, recessions and stock market crashes really have been instigated or started by central banks sort of pulling away the punch bowl. They raise rates and that has led to a slowdown and ultimately has led to these crashes that we see.”

He said they’re not stupid, just reckless.

“They realize that global economies are in a situation now where central banks can’t pull away,” he said. “And they’re bluffing if they say they can.”

* Treasury Department data shows the budget deficit for the first fourth months of fiscal 2020 at $389.2 billion.

Over the past 12 months, the gap has been nearly $1.1 trillion as the national debt has swelled past $23 trillion. (CNBC)
* On today’s economic calendar, the government releases its weekly report on initial jobless claims as well as the January Consumer Price Index at 8:30 a.m. ET. Federal Reserve speeches by Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and New York Fed President John Williams on the economic outlook and monetary policy will also be of interest to investors. (CNBC)
* This morning’s batch of corporate earnings include the latest numbers from AIG (AIG), Alibaba (BABA), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), BorgWarner (BWA), Generac (GNRC), LabCorp (LH), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Waste Management (WM), and Zoetis (ZTS).

* PepsiCo earnings top Wall Street estimates (CNBC)
* China’s confirmed 15,152 new coronavirus cases and 254 additional deaths. That brings the country’s total death toll to 1,367 as the number of people infected hit 59,804. China’s Hubei province said it’s starting to include “clinically diagnosed” cases in its figures and that 13,332 of the new cases fall under that classification.

(NBC News)
* Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, after he barely received support in either the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary.

* Barclays’ Chief Executive Jes Staley is being investigated over his links to Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted sex offender who committed suicide in jail last year.

In the beginning of 2020 i sold 60% of all my holdings because i believe we will either have a correction or recession occur in the upcoming 2 years due to the economy, politics and various reasons and the more i read about the market i get a feeling we are in a major bubble that's about to pop any time soon.. I'm not confident enough to sell 100%, i could be wrong and that's why i keep 40% invested.

However i'm sitting here thinking why the market is continuing to climb meanwhile hundreds of companies are loosing money due to the Corona Virus, I myself work for a car company that has factories in China which are currently on a production pause, this will obviously effect the amount of cars we produce and will result in a money loss. Almost every business in China is on pause and this will effect hundreds of big companies around the world because many big companies have productions in China due to cheap labor.

This also effect the surroundings because when China stands still we can't ship our car parts to China, therefore we get limited space because of overflow and it's basically a small crisis. 

I believe when companies releases their first Q1 reports the stock market will plunge and the cause will be because of the Corona Virus but people may question why hundreds of companies has had a bad Q1 report, what do they have in common, maybe they'll think people have stopped consuming as much or who knows. I don't think people realize what an impact this virus will have but i'm excited to see what happens after all the Q1 reports.

So might it be a good strategy for people with gaming experience (whatever that even is) to, for example: short a gaming companies stocks big time with leverage? Is there any law protecting them from getting shorted? Would a long call on a promising release be a valid alternative?

I mean there's games coming out left and right every week nowadays and they offer beta access, which is basically a massive multiplayer online fundamental analysis. MMOFA lol. 

I never thought about trading anything else than big players, resources etc. and now I'm wondering if I could earn along the success and failures of the video game companies I pumped a ton of money into. :P

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Below are real tips on improving your stock trading game based on simple research, which are the main points from the video above. 

Traders get better because they learn to deal with the disposition effect (holding losses and selling gains). An additional year of trading experience decreases the disposition of a median investor by about 7% and improves performance by 32 bp (.32%) when returns are measured over 20-day horizons (7% annually).

1.	Think about Financial Decisions (Trades) in Light of How You Would Advise Someone Else

To speed up your learning process and get more experience, you should start thinking about your financial decisions in light of how you would advise a customer. This technique helps traders stay rational and unbiased. By doing so you are seeing your behavior from a 3rd person point of view and need to justify your strategy, forcing you to evaluate your own techniques. 

https://www2.monash.edu/impact/articles/accounting/overcoming-the-disposition-effect/

2.	Automate Selling Losses and Gains of 25%

Another strategy to eliminate the disposition effect is automating your behaviors using software or auto buy or sells. Das (2012) observed that automatically selling stocks that had increased or decreased 25% from their initial prices fully eliminates the losses caused by the disposition effect.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254299210\_Estimating\_the\_Loss\_from\_the\_Disposition\_Effect\_A\_Simulation\_Study

3.	Get Feedback to Reduce Overconfidence and Over-trading

The annual turnover of men is about 80% while the annual turnover of women is about 50%. The reason is directly explained by overconfidence in which men traded 45% more than women. Men traded more because of overconfidence. 

In fact, over-trading and overconfidence are counterproductive and using the data from 35,000 households from a large discount brokerage, excess trading reduces net return by 2.65% each year and 1.72% each year for women.

The best way to overcome this is by asking for feedback or participating in discussions. Receiving feedback is one of the best ways to know what you don’t know. This is capable of helping new traders make better decisions and stop over-trading.

The momo (momentum) crowd in the stock market has it all figured out. “Good” news is “great” news. “Bad” news is “good” news. There is nothing that cannot be twisted into a reason to buy.

Is Bernie Sanders’ win in New Hampshire a good thing for the stock market? Wall Street says “yes” because this makes Donald Trump stronger. Is coronavirus a good thing? Wall Street says “yes” because central banks will print more money. Why not buy on the news of the coronavirus and then buy again on the news of the coronavirus’ spread slowing? No kidding, the crowd is now buying on the news of the coronavirus slowing, even though the stock market is higher now than when the coronavirus first emerged.

Why not buy on bad economic data, as it will simply make central banks inject more liquidity? This is exactly what is happening.

In the middle of all this so-called “good” news, investors ought to note that the generals are rushing to the front line, but the troops aren’t following. Does anyone see anything wrong with this strategy?

* After a decline that took the major averages well off their Tuesday session highs, U.S. stock futures point to a strong Wednesday open as investors become slightly less concerned about the coronavirus. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq did manage to eke out record closes Tuesday despite the fall from their highs, and both are up in six of the past seven sessions. (CNBC)
* On today’s economic calendar, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be back on Capitol Hill today, this time before the Senate Banking Committee in the second day of his semi-annual testimony on monetary policy. The Mortgage Bankers Association is out with its weekly report on mortgage applications at 10 a.m. ET, while the Energy Department releases its usual Wednesday look at oil inventories at 10:30 a.m. ET. (CNBC)
* Bitcoin hits highest price this year, above $10,000 as Powell discusses cryptocurrencies (CNBC)
* Powell says Fed ‘closely monitoring’ coronavirus for hit to China and the world (CNBC)
* Earnings reports out before the opening bell include CVS Health (CVS), Molson Coors (TAP), Moody’s (MCO), and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). After-the-bell reports will come today from Altice US (ATUS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Equifax (EFX), International Flavors (IFF), Marathon Oil (MRO), MGM Resorts (MGM), Redfin (RDFN), and TripAdvisor (TRIP).
* Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) were losing about a quarter of their value in the premarket after the home goods retailer said same-store sales were down a greater-than-expected 5.4% in December and January. The company blamed increased promotional pricing, lower store traffic and issues with inventory management. (Reuters)
* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) were down over 4% in the premarket despite a strong fourth-quarter report. The company’s earnings beat estimates on revenue and active riders and a lower-than-expected loss per share.

Many stock market bulls are expressing surprise that a net $88 billion was pulled out of U.S. equity funds and ETFs last year. They would have predicted that the net fund flow would have been in the opposite direction.

After all, the stock market in 2019 had one of its best years in modern U.S. history, with the S&amp;P 500 [**SPX,** **+0.45%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote)  including dividends) gaining more than 31%. Shouldn’t that strong of a market drawn more money in?

Regardless of the answer, the bulls believe that this absence of strong inflows is positive for the stock market’s outlook: Just imagine how much higher the stock market will rise once that money is lured back into equities.

Unfortunately, the bulls are wrong on both counts. According to data from EPFR, a division of [**Informa Financial Intelligence**](https://financialintelligence.informa.com/), last year was the fifth in a row in which investors took money out of U.S. equity funds. Indeed, as you can see from the accompanying chart, there were net inflows in just two of the last 10 years.

Alpha Vantage obviously get its data from Yahoo Finance.

Probably, someone else before me noticed that peculiar behaviour but I have not found any thread with a relevant title.

Anyway,   here is the case. I have attached a screenshot which displays  the   number of shares that have been bought and sold for 07.02.2020 of Square   Enix Holdings. Here is the link-&gt;&gt;&gt;[Interval - Day](https://imgur.com/HHIR1Ok)

As it can be observed volume value for the whole day is 1.53M.

However, if interval is changed to 1H instead of 1D the following volume values hours-wise are displayed:

2/7 9 AM: 515.8K2/7 10 AM: 229.1K2/7 11 AM: No volume at all2/7 12 PM: 942.4K2/7 1 PM: 236.6K2/7 1 PM: 1.56M

If to sum it up, then the final value is 2.97 M.

You can try it for yourself-&gt;[Square Enix stock - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/9684.T#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%3D%3D)

I also go over how a letter from Elliot Management has changed the landscape of AT&amp;T as they work towards developing 5G, a higher quality phone service, and other forms of media like HBO Max.  

AT&amp;T had made a lot of poor decisions in the last 10 years from purchasing Direct TV to the purchase of Time Warner but it now seems like they are turning a new leaf and the stock is set to take off. Not only that though, even through this weak decade AT&amp;T has yet to cut their dividend which as a dividend investor this is key. With the value of AT&amp;T's stocks being in the $30 range I think it is time to pounce.   

As always we will review my M1 finance portfolio as I had more dividend be paid out as well as watch a trailer for the new HBO max network coming to users this May.

Investors made crystal clear this past week that they aren’t ready to abandon the “buy-the-dip” response to stock market pullbacks, despite warnings that the tried-and-true approach may soon meet its match.

Indeed, one high-profile warning came from Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz and former chief executive at Pimco. He made waves early this week when he warned that China’s coronavirus outbreak could be the catalyst that finally [**snaps investors out of the buy-the-dip mentality**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-will-shake-markets-out-of-their-buy-the-dip-mentality-says-el-erian-2020-02-03). El-Erian laid out a compelling argument in [**a Financial Times guest column**](https://www.ft.com/content/a47396be-4449-11ea-a43a-c4b328d9061c), warning that the potential for cascading global economic fallout from a prolonged outbreak would challenge the ability of global central banks, many of which have already used up their monetary policy ammo, to provide a backstop.

That may prove true. But for now, investor faith in the central bank backstop looks pretty solid.

As worries about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy rose, triggering a sharp selloff in equities, expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut later this year rose, according to the fed futures market. Efforts by the People’s Bank of China to provide stimulus and liquidity also served to soothe nerves, triggering a sharp rebound in equities that saw all three major U.S. benchmarks move back into record territory by Thursday. ...

But some market watchers share El-Erian’s doubts about the durability of a “buy-the-dip” framework predicated on central bank largesse. After all, while **central-bank efforts are aimed at backstopping demand**, the viral outbreak, via its impact on factories and production in **China, has implications for the supply side of the economy.**

As you've all undoubtedly noticed, this sub is growing (now at 310k subs and counting), but one of the issue it has is an abundance of lazy/low effort posts/questions. On that note I thought I'd share some ideas on how we can all improve it, primarily from the **submission** side:

# 1) If you want to know if a stock is a good/bad buy, **give us some material to work with**!

There's a 100% chance that no one here has the exact same idea as you when it comes to your investment/trading strategies, so put some thought into your questions:

- **Bad question**: ""hayyy lol what do u guys think of msft?""
- **Good question**: ""What are the key drivers of MSFT's success in the market and what areas of the company should I focus on to decide whether it's a good investment right now?""

If you're a technical trader and looking for quick trades and don't really care about the fundamentals:

- **Bad question**: ""Is ABC company going to keep going up?!""

- **Good question**: ""I'm a swing trader and really like this chart on ABC Company: I'm thinking of buying 1000 shares at $10 with a stop loss at $9 and a target of $14 and would hope to sell within a couple weeks at most. Here's an image of the chart w/ my support/resistance lines on it. I also noticed the company has low float, has a lot of short sellers involved in it, and has had a stream of positive news for the last couple months. Does this seem like a good trade or am I missing anything?""

See what I did there? The first question doesn't ask what the community thinks, but how you can learn to make your own decision w/ help from the community, which is much more valuable in the long run...the second asks not only a question but also gives us a rationale for why you think it's a good trade, what your thought process is in coming to your decision, entry/target/stop loss prices, a chart so we don't have to pull it up on our own, etc.

The point is, it's impossible for anyone to give you an intelligent answer if you don't ask an intelligent question. So, ask good questions and get good answers. It will improve the quality of the sub as a whole and also reduce low effort posts since many of those questions will already be answered. You'll also find asking better questions brings out traders/investors with more experience to answer them, which will in turn get you higher quality responses.

# 2) If you don't know how to get started, **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SEARCH THE SUB BEFORE ASKING**!

Everyone was new at some point. There are dozens of results for this simple query within just the last few months, all you have to do is type ""[how to get started](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/search?q=how+to+get+started&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=off&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)"" or ""[new to stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/search?q=new+to+stocks&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)"" or something similar in the search bar and read until your eyes fall out of your head. The experienced people here are sick of answering this question and it's so easy to just search, read the wiki, check out the sidebar links, etc. Laziness doesn't pay in the markets, so don't be lazy! Google your faces off and do some damn research before you post asking for help so people here can answer unique and interesting questions! In other words, **if you ask ""How do I get started in the stock market?"" the answer is ""type 'how do I get started in the stock market?' into Google, or the search bar here""** This also goes for the more common things that come up (e.g. How does after hours work?, What's the difference between a market/limit order? What's the best broker for a new trader? etc) This stuff has been answered a million times and it's all in the archive so just search for it and get an instant answer instead of waiting for replies.

Annnnd finally, 

# 3) Let's get rid of these pointless stream of consciousness posts w/ no content e.g. ""OMG THE MARKET IS FLYING TODAY!!"" 

They help no one and don't even ask a question. If someone is here reading, they know. We're all watching the markets. If you post stuff like this, share something interesting in the content of the post! What trades are you making today? Why are you sharing this? What are you trying to add to the community w/ your post? Let's try to add value here, people. Make /r/stockmarket great again ya know? If your post doesn't add any value, e.g. doesn't have any content, is just some random blurb, just a link to an external article w/ no questions/opinions/thoughts on what it represents, a random ticker w/ a question mark, etc...it's not adding any value so we're just gonna remove it to keep the sub clean.

So anyway, no real trigger for this post, just something I've noticed lately...the sub is growing and has the potential to be valuable, but the low effort posts and repeated questions that could easily just be searched are killing its value. If you have trading ideas, share them. If you have questions, ask them, but make sure that you put some effort into it! In the market, the worst thing you can be is lazy. There is no get rich quick scheme, there's no single place you can go to get started, there's no secret strategy that will always work, and no one knows for certain whether the market or any stock will go up, down, sideways, crash tomorrow or a tyrannosaurus rex will rampage through the NYSE. If you want to learn the market, do some digging on your own and come here with well thought out questions that can add to the community as a whole!

China is the factory to the world. There are now conflicting reports about factory openings in the aftermath of the coronavirus. That matters to the economy and, of course, companies.

It has always been the job of government and companies to spin stories. Perhaps today the same is being done with the coronavirus’ impact.

In our analysis at The Arora Report, the impact of coronavirus on China’s GDP for the first quarter will be at the rate of about 1.5%. China is still the growth engine of the world. It will drag down world growth. Should investors care? Price action in the stock market shows that most investors do not care. Paradoxically, such investors may be right.

The current motto of investors is: “In central banks we trust.” Central banks have shown that they stand ready to put lipstick on everything to drive stock markets higher across the world. What can possibly go wrong? So far it has been a free lunch. Let’s examine with the help of a chart.

# First Glance

At first glance, this looks like a classic case of [spring loading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spring_loading.asp) earnings. Their CFO, General Counsel, and Chief Human Resource Officer, all received stock grants on [February 2nd](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=0001517175&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) this year instead of March (or May as is the case of last year) when they typically receive their grants.

\*Can’t post images, so linking to tables. See the grant dates table [here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1044/1*TzceYWWv3NaDgKVfWKM8Tw.png). See the article with images [here](https://medium.com/spring-loading/is-the-chefs-warehouse-chef-spring-loading-q1-earnings-f298643879bf).

You will also notice that their grants always came *after* their Q4 earnings call for those years (as it should). Then, all of a sudden, they granted the stock before earnings this year.

[Table image](https://miro.medium.com/max/866/1*luvgT6_47GKXfcLXd6_cUQ.png)

There is also some other interesting news that has happened over the last 6 months (thanks to [landhag69](https://www.reddit.com/user/landhag69) — nice name lol — on Reddit for pointing me towards some of this info).

* In November, they [raised $145 million](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/22/1951614/0/en/The-Chefs-Warehouse-Announces-Closing-of-1-875-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering.html). That money was used to buy [Sid Wainer and Son](http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-acquires-sid-wainer-son) (a curator and distributor of specialty food) on January 27th and [Cambridge Packing Company](http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-acquires-cambridge-packing-company) on February 3rd (the same day they reported their executive stock grants — though I don’t believe they were spring loading this announcement because that is just too close together). \* The stock is up 6.5% since February 3rd
* In November, Blackrock [announced](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2821864&amp;headline=CHEF-BlackRock-reports--passive-stake-in-Chefs-Warehouse) a 12.4% passive stake in $CHEF (which they just released an [update](https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form++SC+13GA+++Chefs%26apos%3B+Warehouse%2C+Inc.+++++++++++++++Filed+by%3A+BlackRock+Inc./16412042.html) two days ago stating that this was actually a 12.9% stake)
* On January 15th, Conestoga Capital [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163744/000108514620000197/chef_11520.htm) a 7.1% stake in $CHEF.
* They also released FY2020 guidance on January 14th which the market seemed to like (+1%).

The acquisitions of the two companies as well as the large investments by Conestoga and Blackrock suggest that there may be optimism surrounding the company. However, since this is already public news, it could already be baked into the stock price (and the 6.5% gain we have seen over the last week).

So apparently, the reason these grants were awarded is that they completed “ we find that this may all be easily explained.

# Deeper Look

As we dive into the [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517175/000094787120000088/xslF345X03/ownership.xml), we see that the grants awarded were a result of “*shares delivered in connection with the vesting of performance-based restricted common stock award granted in 2017 pursuant to The Chefs’ Warehouse 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan based upon achievement of certain performance targets that were certified on February 3, 2020*"". The gist of the plan seems to be that they set aside 1.5 million shares (which at some point was increased to [1.75 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517175/000151717519000003/chef-12282018x10k.htm) shares) to grant to executives and employees based on their performance. ***\*If anyone has more info on the plan. Please share!***

So apparently, the reason these grants were awarded is that they completed “*certain*” performance goals for a chunk of stock that was awarded in 2017. However, looking through the awards given out in 2017, I cannot find what this performance achievement was to make any decisions on whether or not this bodes well for upcoming earnings. If anyone finds anything, leave a comment!

# Conclusion

What starts out as a classic case of spring loading seems to transition into an easily explained case of employees hitting their performance goals. The only problem left is that we can’t figure out what goal they hit. If anyone finds the answer, please leave a comment with it! With that being said, the employees hitting their performance goal could be a good sign, but since we don’t know what that goal is, that is an incredibly murky position to take.

There are also quite a few more reasons why this isn’t a super strong case for spring loading:

* They had a decent 2019 (+13%) and just received some large investments, so they don’t seem like an obvious acquisition target
* There have been no big stock purchases made on the open market recently by any of the executives
* Only 3 of the 6 executives received a stock grant. Two of the executives that didn’t receive a grant are Chris and John Pappas, the co-founders of Chefs’ Warehouse. The other was the Chief Accounting Officer. The easy explanation here seems to be that neither Chris nor John received grants in 2017 (which is what just vested) and the Accounting Officer was not yet an executive in 2017!

Demetri Kofinas speaks with Christopher Cole, the founder of Artemis Capital Management about how to grow and protect generational wealth that lasts a hundred years. Imagine you have the opportunity to grant your family great wealth and prosperity for 100 years. The opportunity is subject to one final choice. You must decide what assets to invest in and maintain that allocation for an entire century without ever changing it. The future of your children’s children depends on your decision. What do you do?

Quotes: 

**Christopher Cole:  “We've had a long period of excess returns, a long period of demographic inflows and we are now transitioning to a period of likely lower returns, demographic capital outflows, globalization breaking down into more individual interest of countries and nationalism and then finally a shift from capital creation to income redistribution.”**

**Christopher Cole: “During an initial stock market boom, an initial stock market boom becomes driven by usually some sort of combination of legitimate growth, favorable demographics, and technology. That elicits an initial growth period and expansion of the stock market. But then as that growth goes on, as it goes on, in order to generate consistent growth in corporate earnings, year over year, we run out of fundamental drivers. Either the demographics don't look as good, the technology becomes commoditized or overvalued or just fundamentally there are not enough drivers to keep growth going.”**",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,310175,public,confidence,self,"Christopher Cole: “[The] last four decades were the most incredible periods of asset price expansion ever, not just in US history, but EVER. if we don't replicate that, a default in the pension and entitlement system is inevitable; and that will set up a generational, financial and social crisis.”",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/f1tgr6/christopher_cole_the_last_four_decades_were_the/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'aF_RcQAZFUfJmm6mxDbt7Xc2quEp71D6Rjq8y76y2FE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/T-D0y0Cl19Hym1xhZH5aRobvQdQUrc1OVeHWRt-8_Ts.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf18b33939587092fba499c7bf0f468673f5431', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/T-D0y0Cl19Hym1xhZH5aRobvQdQUrc1OVeHWRt-8_Ts.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30c27c123c008b5d1dbc5e72c43e11c591d454bc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/T-D0y0Cl19Hym1xhZH5aRobvQdQUrc1OVeHWRt-8_Ts.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d914629cdd86aaaf21481c8143a40394e934685a', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/T-D0y0Cl19Hym1xhZH5aRobvQdQUrc1OVeHWRt-8_Ts.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=784558d07f19f2f9bd178e28d66ab86487a255ed', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, February 10th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/futures-steady-trump-new-budget-and-coronavirus-deaths-exceed-sars.html)

* With coronavirus concerns still very much in the mix, U.S. stock futures point to more losses for Wall Street following a Friday sell-off. The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq’s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February’s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high. (CNBC)
* The Trump administration will release its fiscal 2021 budget today, which will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years. It’s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump’s promised “Tax Cuts 2.0.” (CNBC)
* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump’s 2021 budget (CNBC)
* No economic releases are on today’s calendar. Two Fed officials have public speaking engagements today, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman making a morning appearance in Florida and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker speaking this afternoon in Delaware. (CNBC)
* Allergan (AGN), Edgewell Personal Care (EPC), and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) are among the companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning. Callaway Golf (ELY) and XPO Logistics (XPO) issue numbers after the closing bell.
* Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 9% in the premarket this morning after a tumultuous week, which saw the stock move more than $100 per share in either direction in three of five sessions. Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)
* China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country. The U.K. has confirmed four further cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight. (CNBC)
* Factories in China remain shuttered as some regions extend shutdowns (CNBC)
* As virus deaths top SARS, survivor tells of treatment (WSJ)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders remains at the top of the Democratic field in a new NBC News/Marist poll of tomorrow’s New Hampshire primary. Sanders gets 25% of likely Democratic primary voters in the poll, while former Mayor Pete Buttigieg receives support from 21%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, comes in at 13%. (CNBC)
* Biden predicts he will ‘take a hit’ in New Hampshire primary after ‘gut punch’ in Iowa (CNBC)
* Mike Bloomberg is the only Democrat to top Trump in Gallup poll of small business owners (CNBC)
* The Iowa Democratic Party allocated delegates based on the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses, giving Buttigieg the largest delegate count, followed closely by Sanders, though many news outlets remained unable to declare a winner. Sanders’ campaign plans to ask for a “partial recanvass” of the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses. (NBC News &amp; AP)
* Sen. Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr’s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)
* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)
* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria’s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It’s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he’s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. (CNBC)
* The federally appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico’s ongoing record debt restructuring saga announced they have come to terms with bondholders of around $35 billion, which accounts for nearly 50% of the bankrupt island’s total debt load. The deal will cut the Commonwealth’s outstanding bond debt from $35 billion to approximately $11 billion. (CNBC)

Anyhow, here are 10 things constantly on traders' minds as they go about their day in the markets. Enjoy.

**10 - Traders think they know NOTHING** 

A good trader constantly reminds themselves that there is so much they DON’T know. Bad traders think they know everything and will constantly be surprised when things don’t work out the way they expect. Smart traders are constantly looking for ways that their ideas could be wrong, challenging themselves to see the flaws in their own thinking. The ancient Athenian philosopher Socrates was credited with immense wisdom because instead of proclaiming what he knew, he merely admitted that he knew nothing. This is how good traders need to think. For example, instead of thinking, “This stock is going to rise because product sales will hit a record next quarter” a good trader understands they CANNOT be certain about what the sales are going to be; and therefore, their attention shifts to things that could help to change their assumptions. What warning signs could they look for that would tell them product sales are not going to meet their expectations? Perhaps information from suppliers of raw material, or evidence from retail stores that confirm actual purchases. Good traders think they know NOTHING FOR CERTAIN and constantly seek to validate or reject their assumptions.

**9 - Traders think about the opportunity cost of their money**

A good trader understands that there are many possible trades to make at any moment, but each dollar can only be used for one trade at a time. The trader must therefore consider the other opportunities that their money could be used for, and shouldn’t make a trade that makes less profit than an alternative opportunity. For example, if the trader’s money is sitting in an investment safely making 10% each year, they shouldn’t take any other trade unless the expected profit is more than 10%. Whatever is the trader’s best, safe alternative for their money at any time represents the opportunity cost of their money. A good trader knows their opportunity cost and constantly deploys their money in the best trades available to them at any time.

**8 - Traders think losses are inevitable**

Bad traders expect to win with every trade, and are therefore surprised when they sometimes make losses. Good traders, on the other hand, know to expect occasional losses. Smart traders understand that the market is outside of their control, and their only job is to win more than they lose—NOT to stop losing entirely. In fact, many good traders intentionally take many trades that will be almost surely lose, as long the reward for winning on just one of the trades is so great that it will make up for all the other losses. This is especially the case with options traders, who sometimes create trades that will lose money week after week, until one day, the trade makes back all of the losses plus a large profit. Traders who think that losses are inevitable will not be surprised by anything the market throws at them. 

**7 - Traders think in terms of risk and reward**

Profitable traders understand that every asset can go up or down, and that the probabilities of moving higher or lower can be different. Taken together, the potential increase in the price, multiplied by the probability of the increase happening, represents the potential reward of betting on the asset. On the other hand, the potential decrease in the price, multiplied by the probability of the decline happening, represents the risk of betting on the asset. It takes skill and practice to estimate how high or low an asset could go, and what the probabilities are of each outcome, but getting it right is something that traders take very seriously. Good traders only make bets when the potential reward outweighs the potential risk.

**6 - Traders think the market’s purpose is to send price signals**

A lot of people think the market is just a place for buyers and sellers to meet and transact. But good traders understand that the market’s purpose isn’t just to get transactions completed, it’s to clarify at what price the transaction happens. In the stock market, this price is publicly available for all to see, and it sends a valuable signal to all different parts of the economy. When stocks are valued highly, they send a signal to entrepreneurs to start new companies in that sector or industry, which increases competition and makes the economy more efficient. When stocks are valued low, they send a signal that companies might be better off breaking up into pieces and selling them off individually, which discourages the formation of large companies and may slow the economy. Good traders use the signals from stock prices and pair them with signals about the economy in order to make better decisions about their trades. For example, if a trader thinks the economy is running at an unsustainably high pace, then high-priced stocks may be overvalued as the economy will eventually slow down, so the trader may want to sell. But if stocks are highly priced and the economy still has room to expand in a sustainable way, it might be a good idea to keep owning those stocks. Outside of the stock market, in the commodities market, for example, prices also send valuable signals. When the price of oil is low, it sends a signal to oil producers to stop drilling wells, which lowers supply. Low prices also encourage people to use more oil, which increases demand. When supply gets low enough and demand gets high enough, traders then place bets on a recovery in oil price. Smart traders use the signals that prices tell them about assets and combine them with other information in order to come up with sound trading strategies. 

**5 - Traders think about the risk of their entire portfolio, not just the risk of each individual position**

This is important. Bad traders think of each of their trades as individual positions with their own risk and reward characteristics. This is true, but it’s an incomplete picture and good traders know how to broaden their scope of understanding. Good traders look at the overall characteristics of the entire portfolio, including the ways in which different trades interact and relate to each other. For example, buying several stocks in the same sector, such as technology, will create a portfolio in which all of the trades move in a similar fashion. This portfolio will have a similar risk and reward profile to any one of the individual trades within in. On the other hand, buying stocks across multiple different sectors assures the trader that their entire portfolio has different characteristics than any single trade within it. Good traders determine how the addition of a new trade will impact their entire portfolio’s risk and return profile, instead of just considering the trade on its own merits. 

**4 - Traders think about the worst that could happen**

The worst possible thing that can happen to a trader is that their trades go so badly, they lose the ability to make new trades. The most direct way this happens is by losing all of the money they have to trade with. Preventing this from happening is always on the mind of good trader. Smart traders prepare for the worst by having a plan to exit positions before losses become unsurmountable. For many traders, this involves implementing what is called a stop-loss, or an automatic sell order that gets triggered if an asset they’ve bought dips below a certain price level. By using stop-losses appropriately, good traders are prepared for the worst.

**3 - Traders think good news can be bad news and bad news can be good news**

Bad traders often get hung up on the news flow about the assets they trade, eager to buy when there is good news and sell when there is bad news. But good traders know that the news alone can be misleading. After all, what moves the price of stock, for example, isn’t whether the news is good or bad. It’s how good or bad the news was, relative to what was expected. Say, for instance, a popular new clothing brand is about to release its earnings figures. Everyone expects sales to be up from the previous quarter. However, when it’s revealed that sales increased 20%, the stock plummets. Why? Rising sales is always good news, but the markets was probably expecting even better news. For traders, news is only good if it’s better than what was expected. Likewise, bad news is only actually bad if it’s worse than what was expected. Smart traders understand the difference, and don’t get caught wrong-footed by buying and selling incorrectly with every new article that comes out.

**2 - Traders think companies, executives, and reporters sometimes stretch the truth or spread rumors**

Naive traders take everything they read at face value. If a penny stock company says it’s going be worth $10 billion dollars some day, these un-savvy traders take them at their word any buy blindly. Good traders understand that everything they hear and read has to be taken with a grain of salt. These smart traders are always asking themselves, what is the motivation of the person expressing a particular opinion? Do they have something to gain by convincing me that a certain trade is a good or bad investment? Even other traders can be the source of misinformation. There is a phrase used to describe traders who try to convince you to make the same trades they have themselves. It’s called “talking their book.” Their book, or portfolio of trades, would perform better if everyone bought what they bought and sold what they sold. Traders who talk their book are only trying to convince others to make the same trades they’ve made; their not necessarily trying to give anyone accurate or useful information. That’s why smart traders think other people are not always completely honest, and act accordingly.

**1 - Traders think that no one is responsible for their success and failure except themselves**

A bad trader will find someone or someTHING to blame when their trades go wrong. Maybe they blame the management of a company they invested in when the company doesn’t perform as well as they expected. After all, it’s the company’s fault that it’s not doing well, right? Of course, but it’s not the company’s fault that the trader decided to buy the stock. If the trader had done better research, they could have uncovered clues that the company’s management team was unlikely to perform at the desired level. Good traders know that ultimately, the performance of their trades is up to them and only them. No one else is responsible for the trader’s positions. No one else can be held accountable when the trader loses money. This can be a tough pill to swallow for some traders, but when it’s embraced, it’s actually quite liberating. It means that traders are 100% in control of their own destiny. And that’s one of the greatest things about being a trader.

The Coronavirus is now officially more deadly than SARS. There have been 811 deaths in mainland China alone, which brings the global death toll to 813. China has pledged 71.85 billion yuan, or $10.26 billion, to fight the virus.

Global supply chain disruptions, halted tourism and heightened uncertainty from the coronavirus has rippled through world markets. Economists at UBS revised its forecast for GDP growth in the U.S. due to effects from the coronavirus.

“We see the net effect on the U.S. as being small, but the quarterly swings are likely to be measurable. For the U.S., we see the effect coming through three channels: tourism, exports, and a temporary disruption to manufacturing because of delayed imports,” economist Seth Carpenter wrote in a note Feb. 7. “For Q1, we have trimmed our real GDP estimate by 0.2 pp to a 0.4% q/q annual rate. We assume that the hit in the U.S. from the coronavirus is mostly reversed over the course of Q2 and Q3.”

Fed testimony

Thus, market participants will turn to Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell’s semi-annual testimony in front of Congress this week for clues on whether or not the central bank’s stance on interest rates has changed.

“If the Fed recognizes a sharp slowing in Q1, they will be surprised, worried, and prompted to cut rates, as early as the March FOMC. However, the Fed is wary of a temporary disruption from the virus,” Carpenter said. “In January, Chair Powell highlighted ‘...there is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally...’ If the Fed expects any slowing to be temporary, they will be inclined to wait for more information, hurting the odds of a cut in March. Indeed, if manufacturing starts to recover, those odds fall a bit more.”

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the summary for Disney. Keep in mind this was back in November/December before Disney displayed strength in their subscriptions. Feel free to post comments here.

# Summary

We believe that Disney entering the DTC market was the right move for the following reasons. They have invested huge amounts into the tech platform (BAMTech) to enable this kind of service. They have one of the strongest brand names in media and entertainment as well that they are the leading content provider on the planet. Their studio productions will be able to serve two fold as blockbuster hits and then down the road adding to their streaming service. It only makes sense for them to dominate the growing DTC media/entertainment market.

However, the DTC market is becoming saturated with strong competitors including: Amazon Prime Video, Roku, Netflix, and now the entrants of Disney+ and the recently announced AppleTV+. We see this competition as a double-edged sword in the sense that there is the potential to grab revenues and market-share with the willingness of big companies to take some of the pie (powerful companies want to enter this market because it makes sense to), but also that more elite entrants into this already cut-throat industry is no easy task. What will separate one company from the rest will be their ability to provide quality content, which Disney has positioned themselves to do.

It is possible Disney will be sensitive to outside economic pressures that might affect their cash flow. Revenues from the Media Networks segment (and largest portion of revenues) of their business has been on the decline over recent years, but has been off-set by higher revenues from Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment. Should any of their other segments come short of providing support, their cash flow will take a hit.

The introduction of Disney+ will barely make a dent in their net revenues over the next 4-5 years. Potential growth and valuation will be highly dependent on subscriber count, but with Disneys current state of the brand and franchises they have put themselves in a great position to compete with their largest competitor, Netflix. With quality content coming from each of their studios (Marvel, Pixar, StarWars, and National Geographic, to name a few) they will have a strong line-up going into this launch.

**Final Thoughts**

Disney is entering a highly competitive market, but we believe they have the right tools to succeed.

**1.** They've already successfully tested out the tech to launch DTC services (BAMTech - 4.9B in expenditures by FY 2020).  
**2.** Their already successful content outlets will provide a great value to their service.  
**3.** Competition, such as Netflix and AppleTV+, will be spending billions on content without a proven track-record. This is a risk for them and not so much for Disney since Disney already has a great pipeline of many quality IP.  
**4.** In terms of pricing, we see many similarities between all DTC content providers and the key factor that will separate one company from the other will be in content, which we believe Disney will provide and excel at.  
**5.** Disneys stock price has already jumped over 30% from the initial announcement of Disney+, but we think this new range will serve as a benchmark and good support.  
**6.** Disney isnt expected to report blowout subscriber count on the launch of their service, but we foresee they have the possibility to do so.

**Positive Outlook Model:**  
\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y (quality studio releases, leveraging of brands to park themes, etc).  
\*Disney reports fantastic initial subscriber count for Disney+.  
\*Disney reports ESPN+ growing in-line with expectations.

**Neutral Outlook Model:**  
\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y.  
\*Disney reports mediocre numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+ (as they are expected and will be viewed as a neutral event).

**Negative Outlook Model:**  
\*Market is affected by recession, Disney sensitivity to economic pressures.  
\*Growth slowing at media networks.  
\*Growth slowing at parks and resorts.

ok, i need advice. i recently took up trading on plus500 trading platform, and i am seriously regretting it, and feeling stupid for not learning all the risks involved before diving in. So, ive already lost a bit of money, i currently have alibaba open position on 660 shares. the opening rate was 226.94 USD on 16 jan 2020. So for those of you know how plus500 and CFDs work, the current rate is 216.37. I currently have a maintanance margin of $11000 AUD and equity of $30,500 AUD. i am currenty running a loss of $11,800 aud. I am trading from australia, so its impossible for me to stay up all night to watch ther NYSE, so im thinking of setting a stop if it drops a bit more down to $216.37 USD as a safety net if it drops down any further and cut my losses rather than waiting it out and having overnight funding fees chewing up more money and the potential of it crashing down further and having my position automatically closed and suffering a massive loss, or should i wait it out a bit more before setting it to close? im just worried about the coronavirus, and a possible chinese downturn. anyone? its driving me nuts.

i guess it might be an idea to watch hong kong before i decide, it does seem that the new york listing does tend to follow the trend (up or down at close) on hong kongs market on a daily basis. ive taken off the stop for now, will look at hong kong market tmw before deciding. If you put the past months performance from hong kong and new york side by side, they are almost identical, so im thinking this might be a good indicator?

Starting with unresponsive brokers and ending with smartly hidden fees and costs, the Forex trading process can become very expensive very fast and this can happen even before a trader can turn a dollar into profit.

This means that traders need to have a considerable amount of capital before they can begin trade. I also believe that institutional involvement is another significant aspect of Forex trading, unlike crypto, Forex traders are competing with established banks, high-frequency traders, and other specialized companies.

In a nutshell, I have found that this institutional involvement makes it very challenging to compete.

Here are some very interesting and productive facts as to why cryptocurrency trading is better than forex trading:

**1) Your safety, your money**

Unlike the Forex market where there are many suffocating regulations, as well as many cases of identity theft, crypto traders that use digital currency are in direct control of their transactions which makes everything much safer. Another important thing here that I’ve noticed here is that the transactions are made free from the identities of the parties involved. This grants a considerable amount of help in protecting users from all forms of identity theft.

**2) There is no inflation**

Every traditional currency experiences different inflation fluctuations because of the ongoing movement of global economies which shifts prices continuously. In response to this, countries print more money, therefore, increasing capital inflation. Cryptocurrency does not experience this issue. That’s why it is more predictable.

**3) Cryptocurrency trading is a clear process**

Unlike forex trading crypto trading uses a recorder which is called a blockchain, it is here where all transactions are recorded and monitored. In other words, when a transaction is completed it is automatically transcribed on the ledger. These transactions can be verified by anyone anytime. No person or organization can modify this ledger this is why this is considered to be the biggest security feature.

**4) Fast and solid transactions.**

Probably the best advantage, when compared to the forex market, is that the crypto market is free from any type of central banking regulations and control as well as other third-party vendors, that’s why transaction fees are extremely low.

**5) Availability**

The crypto investment funds bring many opportunities between parties anywhere in the world. These enable individuals to use and trade cryptocurrency even if they are from harsh countries without solid banking institutions.

**What are crypto funds and why they are beating forex?**

In the complex world of cryptocurrency trading, a user is required to have plenty of crypto assets.

Those who are new to this practice are already mining an abundant quantity of cryptocurrency, without the help of an investment fund this can be rather difficult due to the growing complexities of the prospecting process.

So I ask myself how can novices build up their assets?

This is when a crypto fund comes into the picture!

I’ve discussed with [trading specialists](https://fundplatform.io/?utm_source=reddit) who specialize in creating crypto funds to give you all the characteristics of what the crypto funds are as well as the new outcomes in this field.

A crypto fund is the regulated asset of a digital currency that is accessible to the investors for replication, it also works as a connection between a trader, who is producing the crypto fund, and the one who would gladly invest in that supply.

The concluding goal of engaging in a crypto fund is to augment crypto assets for both the winning participants.

In the year 2020, the crypto funds have evolved as the digital translation of fiat currency. Because this is an independent form of currency, it enables anyone to inaugurate a fund solely by adding a new cryptocurrency.

As a consequence, several types of crypto funds have developed aiming to gratify the desire of investors and traders so that they can ultimately increase their digital assets.

Many currencies are regulated by their governments making them sensitive to financial and pecuniary procedures as well as other geopolitical developments. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are managed instantly by clever algorithms and are only influenced by the actions of those using them. This makes the crypto market more engaging for investors who do not want vulnerability to inflation or state administration policy arrangements.

**Why did I invest in crypto funds instead of trading or mining**

Here are the major advantages that you may experience after you invest in a crypto fund:

* The leading advantage of financing in a crypto fund is that the cryptocurrency is going to be the money of the tomorrow. Therefore, financing in such crypto funds will aid you to earn a solid future.
* Most of crypto funds are open, sharing their asset structure with weekly reports
* People can invest in crypto funds from anywhere in the world
* Cryptocurrency mining has now grown more complex than it was in the past. Because of this, the rate of crypto mining is reduced due to the notable turnover of people towards cryptocurrency and the developments introduced in the mining algorithms. It became harder to track new movements in the market
* Investing in crypto funds fits a reliable method to develop your assets.
* Crypto funds offer greater profit margins.
* The volatility of assets is limited.
* As a crypto fund manager You can fundraise investments directly to your wallet without any type of fees
* Absolutely anyone can invest in your trading strategies even if they are a million miles away.
* You are not required to be legally registered (but if you want people to trust you - you have to be legally registered)

Ending Ideas

In conclusion I feel confident that Forex is now becoming a trading process of the past and it will continue to remain affixed in the 2000’s but now in the year 2020 the future resides in the crypto investment fund because it is a highly suitable method to earn money without getting stuck in any difficult mining algorithms.

[**On Tuesday**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-bezos-just-sold-18-billion-in-amazon-stock-2020-02-04), filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the Amazon founder and CEO had sold 905,456 shares on Friday and Monday for a total of $1.84 billion. According to new [**SEC**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000089924320003505/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)[**filings**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000089924320003503/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) Thursday, Bezos sold an additional 810,912 shares Tuesday and Wednesday for around $1.65 billion. That brings his nearly weeklong total to more than 1.7 million shares sold for about $3.49 billion.

The four-day selloff equates to about 3% of his total Amazon [**AMZN,** **+0.51%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote)   stake.

The sales were pre-arranged, though they coincided with Amazon becoming just the fourth U.S. company [**to reach $1 trillion in market cap** ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-is-officially-worth-1-trillion-joining-other-tech-titans-2020-02-04)earlier this week. Last Thursday, Amazon blew away fourth-quarter earnings expectations, [**posting a holiday-season profit of $3.3 billion** ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-earnings-return-to-growth-in-holiday-season-sending-stock-soaring-toward-1-trillion-valuation-2020-01-30)on record quarterly sales of $87.4 billion.

Bezos typically sells off large chunks of his Amazon shares throughout the year, at pre-arranged times. [**Last August**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-bezos-has-sold-almost-3-billion-in-amazon-stock-over-the-past-week-2019-08-05), he sold nearly 1.5 million shares for about $2.84 billion, during a time when Amazon stock was suffering its worst losing streak in 13 years.

Bezos is the world’s richest individual, by a comfortable margin. His $126 billion fortune is about $9 billion more than the runner-up, Microsoft Corp. [**MSFT,** **+2.07%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft?mod=MW_story_quote)   co-founder Bill Gates, according to [**the Bloomberg Billionaires Index**](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/).

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

I'm fairly new to the world of traditional finance, but I'm looking to invest in a more diversified portfolio. I started investing in crypto about 2 years ago at the time of the big crypto bull market. At the time I only used some extra money I had left just lying around. After the end of that bull market I lost interest (after losing most of my investment) as many did, but I learned the important lesson that emotional investing never works in the long run. Now I'm again looking at crypto (hold your pitchforks please), but knowing how risky it is I want to diversify in other assets such as stocks, and possibly commodities (not sure if I shoudl go to a different subreddit for that).

I'm not looking for people to tell me what stocks to invest in, but I was hoping you could help me in the right direction to learn about the stockmarket. For example, whether it's worth it to put money in an index fund, if you wont have enough time to do a lot of researching for picking certain stocks. I did follow a short course about traditional investments, where i learned about things like the CAPM model and how indeces work, but they didn't teach us about the best way to actually get your money in assets effeciently.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,307264,public,confidence,self,New to traditional investments,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/eztmqs/new_to_traditional_investments/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What are the differences between these two listings?

I know the basics of what an ADR is and I suppose DL might stand for Dual Listing or Direct Listing. I have noticed some differences such as in volume, but I don't understand the major difference between the two, and what the rest of the information about them is (1DL, HD and those numbers 0001 and 00002). It does indicate that the ask for NNND.F is x20000 so I suppose the numbers have something to do with that, but the price for both is pretty much the same.

Wouldn’t that decrease the stock’s value, because each share is now worth less of a percentage of the company?

A nasdaq article titled “Where will Plug Power be in 10 years?” Says 

&gt; Over the past decade, investors in Plug have seen shares outstanding in their company grow 18 times in volume, from 12.9 million shares at the end of 2009 to 245.8 million shares today. On the plus side, so long as investors remain willing to buy Plug shares and provide Plug the cash it needs to survive, there's actually a good chance that Plug will remain in business for another 10 years. The problem, though, is that even assuming Plug ""makes it,"" and even assuming the company ultimately earns a profit (eventually), given the rampant dilution going on, by the time that profit does arrive it will be so diluted by so many shares outstanding that any profits accruing to any single investor will be de minimis.
&gt; Long story short: 10 years from now, Plug Power may well still be in business -- but I wouldn't want to own it.

I was asking why aren't 401k plans merely profit-shared savings accounts that are managed by a different entity than the employer (and backed by the government), such that if the employer or the managing entity goes under a person's retirement isn't affected, to which they plainly responded that equities are resistant against inflation and also people just like having more money and don't care where it comes from. I had some quibbles with the first part but it wasn't my hill to die on. 

But, with the current political atmosphere on my mind, I asked whether or not it's possible to enact large-scale stock market and/or general economic reform if everyone's hard-earned retirement money is on the line.

Now I don't know enough to have a cogent opinion about whether or not peoples' retirement is actually in real danger in the face of sweeping financial reform, but it's also safe to say that even the perception that a person's money might be in jeopardy would be enough to produce the same result - and as we all know, politics is all about perception, so the subject can hardly even be broached. 

Nevertheless, it's a growing sentiment that Wall Street needs to be on the hook a little more with respect to public welfare. Any way you slice it, that means skimming money off of rich people and institutions, which is where a lot of the money management action happens. I again don't have enough knowledge to even pretend to have a reasonable view on this, but the existence of this viewpoint is a fact. I'm sick as a dog while writing this so I'm possibly not thinking clearly, and I'm not peddling some kind of conspiracy theory, but isn't this a bit of a hostage situation? A hostage situation that perhaps the general public willingly agreed to out of ignorance (see: 2008 crisis), but a hostage situation nonetheless.

The ascent for shares of the electric-vehicle maker are near-parabolic and the unabashed run-up in recent days has some investors comparing the jump to bitcoin’s surge back in 2017.

To put things in perspective, Tesla’s shares [**TSLA,** **+1.14%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla?mod=MW_story_quote)  have risen 36% to a record price around $887 in just the past two sessions alone. The Silicon Valley darling run by Elon Musk has jumped 180% in the past three months and from its June 3 closing low at $178.97, the company’s shares have gained more than 395%.

By comparison, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **+2.10%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp?mod=MW_story_quote) , which has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index [**SPX,** **+1.50%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote)  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **+1.44%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) , has gained a pedestrian 12.3% in the past three months, 5.5% so far this year and nearly 30% since early June.

...

 At least one, Wall Street pro Michael Novogratz, compared the surge in Tesla to bitcoin’s similarly parabolic move.

Of course, it is clear how that story played out. Bitcoin’s price cratered soon after peaking.

However, on the bright side, it is still up at $9,140, which may be cold comfort for those who bet on further gains in **the No. 1 digital asset in the world.**

&amp;#x200B;

GUYANA GOLDSTRIKE SIGNS US$9 MILLION GOLD FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Guyana Goldstrike Inc. ( GYA.V / GYNAF) has signed a definitive gold forward purchase agreement dated Jan. 24, 2020, with an arm's-length investor for proceeds of up to $9-million (U.S.) for the Marudi gold project, located in Guyana, South America.

Under the terms of the agreement, the investor will make an initial payment of $2-million (U.S.) on or before April 14, 2020. Thereafter, a second payment of $7-million (U.S.) will be advanced within 30 days of a royalty interest in the project in favour of the investor having been registered.

The agreement is non-dilutive to the company's current share structure as no shares or warrants will be issued to the investor. The proceeds will enable the company to finalize its purchase of the project and further explore and develop the resource potential of the property.

In consideration for providing financing, the company has agreed to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold, representing approximately 10 per cent of the project's current mineral resource estimate (please see mineral resource estimates section herein). Deliveries will commence within 120 days of a declaration of commercial production from the project, or within 36 months of the initial financing under the agreement, whichever is the earlier, with an annual delivery schedule of 3,000 ounces. The company has also agreed to grant the investor a right of first refusal to acquire a further 30,000 ounces of gold, on terms to be negotiated between the parties.

The delivery obligation of the company will be secured by a 12.5-per-cent net smelter return royalty in favour of the investor, to be registered against the project. The royalty will not be payable while the company meets the delivery schedule and will expire once all delivery obligations under the agreement have been satisfied.

Mineral resource estimates

The Mazoa Hill zone contains the company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggest that the mineralized zone is open in several directions, including at depth:

* 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 grams per tonne;
* 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 grams per tonne.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,305361,public,confidence,self,Guyana Goldstrike signs $9M (U.S.) gold forward purchase agreement,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/eyr76x/guyana_goldstrike_signs_9m_us_gold_forward/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* Despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, U.S. stock futures were pointing sharply higher this morning as stocks continue to chip away at last Friday’s losses. Monday’s rally put the S&amp;P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC)
* The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others.
* Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers. (CNBC)
* Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOGL) shares slid 3% the premarket despite beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, as the company came in light on revenue. The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC)
* Google still isn’t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC)
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday’s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday’s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC)
* Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state’s Democratic Party said a “reporting issue” caused “inconsistencies” in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC)
* Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC)
* President Donald Trump will be unleashing “relentless optimism” during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: “The Great American Comeback.” (AP)
* The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday’s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump’s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC)
* Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city’s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak. This would be the second known death outside of mainland China. Chinese health officials said earlier that in mainland China the total now sits at 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases.
* No, garlic won’t protect you from coronavirus: WHO pushes back on rampant misinformation (CNBC)
* Coronavirus will likely become a pandemic, warns ex-FDA chief Scott Gottlieb (CNBC)
* Goldman Sachs (GS) is in talks to offer small business loans to merchants on Amazon’s (AMZN) sprawling e-commerce platform. The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC)
* The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell’s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry’s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry’s data and subscription base. For Harry’s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC)
* Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with “advanced lung cancer.” Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment. Last night, Trump tweeted about Limbaugh’s diagnosis, calling the host “a great guy &amp; fantastic political talent,” and wishing him “a speedy recovery.” (CNBC)

Soviet bureaucracy and empty pride slowed down response and the fallout was based on lies and lack of admission to coverup the extent of the radiation until it was too late. The Soviets eventually dissolved and Gorbachev pinpointed Chernobyl as the nucleus of the decay. No pun intended.

I see a lot of parallels with this coronavirus events in China. Don’t want to speculate it’s a bio-weapon but people in China have been eating all kinds of weird shit since the old dynasties. They as a people are strong and genetically accustomed to weird food. If bats didn’t kill you in the 15th century, it isn’t magically appearing in 2019. 

Nonetheless,  a lot of parallels to Chernobyl. Slow response. Lax mitigation strategy. And now a suspension on futures trading. Suspending the stock market is the surest way to accelerate a selloff.

I also think the world, esp S&amp;P500 corporate America placed all eggs in one basket with this level of dependency on China for supply line and manufacturing. Hopefully this is a wake up call to diversify and also bring some manufacturing back home.

France seems to be going with Ericsson. UK is allowing Huawei up to 35% of the peripheral equipment(Radio Masts, etc). 

EU on other hand has recommended limiting, but not banning Huawei. Member nations governments will have the final word. 

As for USA, I could be wrong(and please feel free to share your thoughts on this), It seems to me, Trump administration will use Huawei as bargaining chip in phase 2 of the trade talks. 


Are you holding or thinking about investing in 5G sector stocks? Which stocks are on your radar?

What’s your opinion on Ericsson and Nokia after the UK and EU announcements? Sell or Continue to hold? Keep buying the dips?

Huawei allowed to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, which includes radio masts.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/europe/eu-huawei-5g.html

The European Union told its members that they should limit so-called high-risk 5G vendors, e.g. Huawei, but stopped short of recommending a ban on the firm

The recommendations are as far as the European Union can go in dictating policy to its member nations, whose governments will have the final word on whether and how they want to let Huawei help build their next generation of wireless telecommunications networks.

I received a ton of positive feedback (thank you!!!) ) so I just wanted to let anyone interested know that I just uploaded Episode 3 which explains how to create a Stock Screener for Free in Python! The screener is easy to use and customize and I also go through how to read and write to excel files to save the results. I go step by step and explain as much of the code as possible.

# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**
*****
&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.
*****
&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.
*****
&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.
*****
&gt; China’s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.
*****
&gt; # Correction or pull back?
&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January’s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.
*****
&gt; “February is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it’s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. “I call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,” said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s a good possibility, just based on valuation—over 19.6 times forward earnings. That’s the most since 2002,” he said. “By my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.” A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.
*****
&gt; “People have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,” said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. “We believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.” Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.
*****
&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday’s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.
*****
&gt; “I still think it’s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don’t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn’t really change my view,” she said. “I still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,” she said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said it’s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders’ policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.
*****
&gt; “Only 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,” he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.
*****
&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing’s production shut down.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.
*****
&gt; Stovall said he’s watching “a combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,” he said.
*****
&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become “inverted.” An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China’s economy and the world economy.

# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!

&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**

&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.

# Short Circuit

&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**

&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.

# 49ers Or Chiefs?

&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but “data don’t lie”: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn’t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.

&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.

&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we’ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “There have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And wouldn’t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.”

&gt; Here’s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we’re glad the Patriots aren’t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.

# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm

&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October—spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index’s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven’t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn’t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.

&gt; “The coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002–2003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.”

&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.

&gt; We certainly don’t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003—several months into the 2003–2007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.

&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus

&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.

&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.

&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.

&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.

&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.

&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.

&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.

It is going to get worse before it gets better for the stock market, says prominent technical analyst Ralph Acampora. 

&gt;**‘I think it’s going to be a little deeper. I am looking at 10% maybe a little bit more even.’ \~\~\~                                                  Ralph Acampora**

A pioneer in  the field of price chart-based trading, Acampora told MarketWatch during  a Friday interview that he thinks that the coronavirus fears are a  catalyst for a market that had gotten too pricey and was due for a  substantial pullback.

“The market itself was stretched, which is  true, so we were begging for some kind of correction and this is the  catalyst,” he said. He is expecting that the stock market will face at  least a 10% drop from its recent peak, which would meet the criteria for  a bona fide correction held by most market technicians.

When I first started trading several years back there was 1 big barrier and that was the fees. I remember having a $500+ day and then $500- day but then $200 in trading fees. Overall it worked but it made the whole experience a bit more discouraging.  I've always wanted to get into breakout trading (a bit more aggressive and quick type of trading) and now with the new low fees, I've really decided to jump in it.

""Arvind is the right CEO for the next era at IBM,"" said Rometty. ""He is a brilliant technologist who has played a significant role in developing our key technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud, quantum computing and blockchain.  He is also a superb operational leader, able to win today while building the business of tomorrow.  Arvind has grown IBM's Cloud and Cognitive Software business and led the largest acquisition in the company's history. Through his multiple experiences running businesses in IBM, Arvind has built an outstanding track record of bold transformations and proven business results, and is an authentic, values-driven leader.  He is well-positioned to lead IBM and its clients into the cloud and cognitive era.""

""Jim is also a seasoned leader who has positioned Red Hat as the world's leading provider of open source enterprise IT software solutions and services, and has been quickly expanding the reach and benefit of that technology to an even wider audience as part of IBM,"" Rometty continued.  ""In Arvind and Jim, the Board has elected a proven technical and business-savvy leadership team.""

Virginia Rometty, 62, became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of IBM in 2012.  During her tenure she made bold changes to reposition IBM for the future, investing in high value segments of the IT market and optimizing the company's portfolio.  Under Rometty's leadership, IBM acquired 65 companies, built out key capabilities in hybrid cloud, security, industry and data, and AI both organically and inorganically, and successfully completed one of the largest technology acquisitions in history.  She reinvented more than 50% of IBM's portfolio, built a $21 billion hybrid cloud business and established IBM's leadership in AI, quantum computing and blockchain, while divesting nearly $9 billion in annual revenue to focus the portfolio on IBM's high value, integrated offerings.

Rometty also established IBM as the industry's leading voice in technology ethics and data stewardship, working relentlessly to usher new technologies safely into society, and enabling people of diverse backgrounds and education levels to participate in the digital future.  She has been committed to building talent and skills around the world.  She created thousands of New Collar jobs and championed the reinvention of education around the world, including the explosive growth of the six-year Pathways in Technology Early College High Schools, or P-TECHs, which are helping prepare the workforce of the future, serving hundreds of thousands of students in 200 schools and 24 countries.

""Ginni has provided outstanding leadership for IBM, substantially transforming the company and ushering in a new cloud and cognitive era,"" said Michael Eskew, Lead Director of the IBM Board of Directors.  ""She has taken bold strategic actions to reposition IBM for the future, shedding businesses and growing new units organically and through acquisition, all while achieving record diversity and employee engagement and setting the industry standard for responsible technology ethics and data stewardship.""

""With the strong foundation now established by Ginni for IBM's future, the Board is confident that Arvind is the right CEO to lead IBM,"" Eskew continued.  ""The Board ran a world-class succession process and found in Arvind a leader with the business acumen, operational skills, and technology vision needed to guide IBM in this fast-moving industry.""  

""Arvind thinks and executes squarely at the intersection of business and technology,"" said Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board's Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee.  ""He is an ideal leader to succeed Ginni and take IBM and its clients into the next chapter of the cloud and cognitive era.  Jim has been a great addition to IBM's leadership team.  His considerable business and leadership skills will help IBM grow and flourish, and as President he will help Arvind and IBM continue to accelerate and scale the benefits of Red Hat, while ensuring that Red Hat also preserves its unique culture and commitment to open source innovation.""

""I am thrilled and humbled to be elected as the next Chief Executive Officer of IBM, and appreciate the confidence that Ginni and the Board have placed in me,"" said Krishna.  ""IBM has such talented people and technology that we can bring together to help our clients solve their toughest problems.  I am looking forward to working with IBMers, Red Hatters and clients around the world at this unique time of fast-paced change in the IT industry.  We have great opportunities ahead to help our clients advance the transformation of their business while also remaining the global leader in the trusted stewardship of technology.  Jim will be a great partner in the next step of this journey.""

""I am truly honored to be elected as IBM's President,"" said Whitehurst.  ""I look forward to working with Arvind, and with IBMers and Red Hatters alike, to continue to bring together the best of our companies and cultures.  I've had the opportunity to interact with IBMers across the company over the past few months, and I have been so impressed with the talented and dedicated team we have.  When I first joined, I said that I believe we have the opportunity to be the defining technology company of the twenty-first century.  After working with our clients, IBMers and Red Hatters over the past months, I am even more convinced of that opportunity today.""

Krishna, 57, is IBM Senior Vice President for Cloud and Cognitive Software, where he leads the IBM business unit that provides the cloud and data platform on which IBM's clients build the future.  His current responsibilities also include the IBM Cloud, IBM Security and Cognitive Applications business, and IBM Research.  Previously, he was general manager of IBM's Systems and Technology Group's development and manufacturing organization.  Prior to that he built and led many of IBM's data-related businesses.  He has an undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and a PhD. in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  He joined IBM in 1990.

Whitehurst, 52, is IBM Senior Vice President and CEO of Red Hat, which was acquired by IBM in 2019. He has been an avid advocate for open software as a catalyst for business innovation.  During his tenure at Red Hat, revenue grew over eight times and market capitalization by more than 10 times.  He joined Red Hat from Delta Airlines, where he drove significant international expansion and as Chief Operating Officer oversaw all aspects of airline operations.  Prior to that he was a partner at The Boston Consulting Group.  Mr. Whitehurst earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Economics from Rice University, and holds an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified, so even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about**.

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.

For instance, the financial sector contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited. In other words, the phenomenon of **asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

Tesla TSLA+2.49%  said it earned $105 million, or 56 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $140 million, or 78 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned $2.14 a share, compared with $2 a share a year ago.


Revenue rose 2% to $7.4 billion, compared with $7.2 billion a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the car maker to report adjusted earnings of $1.77 a share on sales of $7 billion.

The after-hours share surge continued as Tesla hosted its conference call with investors, and a mention of potential delays in the Model 3 production in Shanghai due to the deadly coronavirus did nothing to temper investors’ enthusiasm.

## 1. Process first, analysis second, margin of safety last

A robust process can prevent a poor analysis but a good analysis can still create silly mistakes. Let’s say a stock is an excellent buy for 10 reasons. That’s a good analysis; your judgment comes from facts and reasoning rather than false hope. But what’s even better is a robust process. A good process might tell you “Why is that my analysis only consists of supporting evidence? Am I having confirmation bias?” It could also tell you “An excellent buy only need 2-3 reasons max. If I need 10 reasons to convince myself this is a great deal, this could be a warning sign rather than a sign of confidence.” A good process catches things that fall outside of our analysis. And that often determines the long-term investment outcomes more than the brilliance of our analysis. ",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,302715,public,confidence,self,21 Investing Lessons in 2019,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/evxctq/21_investing_lessons_in_2019/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were told the analyst shot out of his chair and screamed in excitement when he found out every stock in the market is a multi-bagger when applying a 1% discount rate. The analyst then proceeded to tell his portfolio manager how they needed to ‘load the fuck up’ on some exchange traded funds (“ETFs”). ETFs are an investment fund on stock exchanges that hold assets such as stocks, commodities and bonds. They are an easy way to get exposure to a broad variety of assets. The portfolio manager recently put out his Q4 investment letter telling his partners how his fund has switched from an active manager to a passive manager in ETFs to get exposure to the entire market. “We just realized every stock in the market is a multi-bagger when using a 1% discount rate and we don’t want to miss out on the potential rally when all find out about his arbitrage.” The Dow railed 40 basis points upon the news that every stock is a multi-bagger with a 1% discount rate. The S&amp;P 500 fell 90 basis points because sometimes stocks go up and some times stocks go down.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, January 29th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/dow-to-rise-big-apple-earnings-possible-impeachment-witnesses.html)

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open despite ongoing coronavirus concerns, following Wall Street’s strong Tuesday rebound. Investors are focused on corporate earnings and this afternoon’s Fed decision as well, following the S&amp;P 500′s strongest one-day gain since October and the Nasdaq’s best daily gain since September. All the major averages are currently sitting roughly 2% below their all-time intraday highs. (CNBC)
* Set to help the Dow this morning, Apple (AAPL) shares were up 2% in premarket trading after the company reported blockbuster iPhone revenue of $56 billion for its fiscal first quarter, blowing past estimates, proving that the new iPhone 11 was off to a strong start over the holidays. Overall Q1 profit and revenue were better than expectations. The fastest-growing segment was Wearables, Home and Accessories. (CNBC)
* CEO Tim Cook says Apple shut one store in China and it’s restricting employee travel due to coronavirus (CNBC)
* Dow components Boeing (BA), Dow Incorporated (DOW) and McDonald’s (MCD) lead this morning’s list of earnings. Microsoft (MSFT), also a Dow component, as well as Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) will grab the spotlight in today’s after-the-bell earnings, with Mondelez International (MDLZ) and PayPal (PYPL) also set to report. (CNBC)
* GE shares rise 5% after earnings top expectations (CNBC)
* The Federal Reserve concludes its latest policy meeting today with interest rates almost certainly to remain on hold but officials likely to discuss possible changes to how they manage the central bank’s key overnight borrowing rate. Fed policymakers issue their decision at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference. This morning, the National Association of Realtors issues its December pending home sales report at 10 a.m. ET. (CNBC)
* Chinese health officials said there are nearly 6,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in China. The coronavirus death toll in China has increased to 132. (CNBC)
* First Mideast cases of coronavirus confirmed in the UAE (CNBC)
* US health officials fast-track coronavirus vaccine, hope to start clinical trial in three months (CNBC)
* US Consulate staffers and other Americans in Wuhan to be evacuated to California (USA Today)
* The Trump administration is considering suspending flights from China to the U.S. amid an escalating outbreak of a new coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the world, CNBC reported. White House officials called executives at major U.S. carriers on Tuesday, telling them that a temporary ban on China flights is on the table. (CNBC)
* British Airways cancels all flights to and from mainland China on coronavirus fears (CNBC)
* The Senate has 16 hours, beginning today, to present written questions in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. Afterward, the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses or produce additional documents. Trump’s lawyers yesterday completed their oral arguments, bringing to a quick end a defense that attempted to discredit the evidence gathered by House Democrats in their initial probe. (CNBC)
* GOP lacks votes to block impeachment trial witnesses (WSJ)
* Trump’s long-awaited Middle East peace plan calls for a state of Palestine with a capital in east Jerusalem. The plan calls for the recognition of Israeli settlements in the West Bank in exchange for a four-year freeze on new settlement activity. The proposal favors Israel and was immediately rejected by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. (CNBC)
* The helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant didn’t have a recommended warning system to alert the pilot he was too close to land but it’s not clear it would have averted the crash that killed nine because the pilot may have lost control as the aircraft plunged into a fog-shrouded mountain, federal investigators said. Determining what caused the crash will take months. (AP)
* TNT’s NBA crew, including Shaquille O’Neal, Dwyane Wade, honor Kobe Bryant (USA Today)
* A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no reports of casualties or heavy damage. The quake was centered 86 miles northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, and 87 miles west-southwest of Niquero, Cuba. (AP)

They danced around the decline in data center CPUS and could not give a straight answer.  This is the most profitable and fastest growing chip segment. INTC just reported a beat of 800 million in this segment in the last quarter.

""executives declined to break down exactly how much of the segment and the forecast was from the gaming chips and how much was from server chips, and what AMD executives did say about the data-center business was not very specific.  Linked article is spot on.  

“In server, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage as unit shipments and ASPs increased sequentially, driven by demand for our second-gen Epyc processors,” AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su said at the beginning of Tuesday’s conference call.

In the call with analysts, it was clear that there was a lot of frustration with AMD combining these two seemingly disparate businesses. Wall Street analysts tried various tactics to ascertain more data on how steep the decline in semi-custom actually was and how its profit margins were impacting AMD’s overall gross profit margin, but largely received vague statements in response.""

The thought is: if the manufacturing and/or exportation companies dwindle in activity, or are currently closed due to a state of emergency, could it be possible that U.S. companies that of which rely heavily on imports slow down in sales therefore affecting gross revenue for this quarter. There could be an opportunity for puts.

On last week's stream we had an awesome chat covering the first module of our new series of lessons on MARKET ESSENTIALS! 

If you missed it, **[here's the permanent link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pwKL_km9hg)** for part 1 so you can get up to speed before tomorrow (part 2 from last week is still being edited cause we actually went for over an hour but hopefully I'll have it uploaded before tomorrow! If not you can just ask questions in the chat to clarify any gaps in the material) 

Anyway, come hang out **tomorrow at 7PM Eastern** in the [**Official /r/StockMarket Discord**](https://discord.gg/p6KPJCh) where we'll cover the first half of module 2 which is on **identifying trading opportunities**! 

We'll talk live about some of the techniques and tools traders use to find trading and investment opportunities, some of the key things that cause all stocks to rise and fall, and most importantly, **how to identify and capitalize on market themes** (*coughcoronaviruscough*)

I'll be leading these lessons myself, sharing what I've learned in my 15 years of experience in the markets, 10 years of learning from and trading with some of the best traders on the planet, 5 years of trading full time and multiple years of experience as a mentor and educator in the markets and finance-focused software development.

If you haven't been to one of these chats yet you really gotta come check it out...they're super fun, educational, and drawing a bigger group every week! This week and next week in particular are gonna be awesome cause the subject matter is something that as traders, no matter how experienced, we can never learn enough about: **how to actually find trades that make us money**.

As always, this is 100% free and open to everyone so please come join and ask questions!

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Jan 27, 2020 (TheNewswire.ca via COMTEX) -- (via TheNewswire)

Vancouver, Canada - TheNewswire - January 27, 2020 - Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Guyana Goldstrike"") (GYA) [**GYNAF,** **+37.43%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gynaf?mod=MW_story_quote) (1ZT) is pleased to announce the Company has signed a definitive gold forward purchase agreement (the ""Agreement""), dated January 24, 2020, with an arms-length investor (the ""Investor"") for proceeds of up to US$9,000,000, for the Marudi Gold Project (""Marudi"" or the ""Property"", or the ""Project"") located in Guyana, South America.

Under the terms of the Agreement, the Investor will make an initial payment of US$2,000,000 on or before April 14, 2020. Thereafter, a second payment of US$7,000,000 will be advanced within thirty days of a royalty interest in the Project in favour of the Investor having been registered.

The Agreement is non-dilutive to the Company's current share structure as no shares or warrants will be issued to the Investor. The proceeds will enable the Company to finalize its purchase of the Project and further explore and develop the resource potential of the Property.

In consideration for providing funding, the Company has agreed to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold, representing approximately 10% of the Project's current mineral resource estimate (please see ""Mineral Resource Estimates"" below). Deliveries will commence within 120 days of a declaration of commercial production from the Project, or within 36 months of the initial funding under the Agreement, whichever the earlier, with an annual delivery schedule of 3,000 ounces. The Company has also agreed to grant the Investor a right of first refusal to acquire a further 30,000 ounces of gold, on terms to be negotiated between the parties.

The delivery obligation of the Company will be secured by a 12.5% net smelter returns royalty in favour of the Investor, to be registered against the Project. The royalty will not be payable while the Company meets the deliver schedule and will expire once all delivery obligations under the Agreement have been satisfied.

Mineral Resource Estimates

The Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open in several directions including at depth.

\- 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 g/t;

\- 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 g/t

For further information concerning the Mazoa Hill Zone Resource Estimate, readers are encouraged to review ""Technical Report: Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate"", a technical report prepared for the Company by Global Mineral Resource Services and is available at: GYA Mazoa Hill Zone 43-101, at the Company's website [**www.guyanagoldstrike.com**](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/) and under the Company's profile on [**www.sedar.com**](http://www.sedar.com/).

Readers are cautioned that although the Project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining license a production decision has not been reached by the Company in respect of the Project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the Project. Also note, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

About Guyana Goldstrike Inc.

The Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project, which has a 17-year mining license and is located in Guyana, South America. Historic diamond drilling completed on the Project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. A mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Mazoa Hill Zone. Data analyzed suggests the zone is open to mineralization in multiple directions and at depth.

Through the recent exploration program, the Company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the Company has over 45 sq. kms of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the Project.

About Guyana

The Republic of Guyana is located in South America adjacent to Suriname. The country is English speaking and its legal system is based on British common law with a democratically elected government. It has an established mining act and a rich history of gold production. The Fraser Institute's 2016 Annual Survey of Mining listed Guyana as the third best mining jurisdiction with regards to investment attractiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean Basin sub-group. The Guiana Shield is the geographic gold-hosting region and is world-recognized as a premier gold region that is highly prospective, under-explored and has geological continuity with West Africa. Barrick has recently announced that the Giuana Shield will be their priority region for discovery opportunities and early stage exploration.\* Exxon Recently announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels of offshore oil with production scheduled for first quarter of 2020. This discovery will designate Guyana as having the fastest growing GPD in 2020, estimated to be 86%.\*\*

Boeing is expected to detail its financing strategy when it reports earnings before the market opens tomorrow. (CNBC)

Corporate America declares War on White America. No reason to sugarcoat what’s happening.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The era of the white, all-male board is coming to an end.  
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon issued the latest ultimatum Thursday from Davos. Wall Street’s biggest underwriter of initial public offerings in the U.S. will no longer take a company public in the U.S. and Europe if it lacks a director who is either female or diverse.  
The mandate is the latest in a series of signals that non-diverse boards and management are unacceptable. BlackRock Inc. and State Street Global Advisors are voting against directors at companies without a female director. Public companies with all-male boards based in California now face a $100,000 fine under a new state law.  
“It’s pretty amazing,” said Fred Foulkes \[[Email him](mailto:ffoulkes@bu.edu)\] a management professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. “It’s a seismic change. I was quite amazed and I wonder what’s going to happen at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.”  
The corporate board has become a rare bright spot for gender and racial diversity at the highest echelons of corporate America. Almost half of the open spots at S&amp;P 500 companies went to women last year, and for the first time they made up more than a quarter of all directors. In July, the last all-male board in the S&amp;P 500 appointed a woman.  
Still, new boards are less diverse: Among the top 25 IPOs by value each year from 2014 through 2018, 10 companies had no female directors, said Malli Gero, co-founder and senior adviser to 2020 Women on Boards, an organization that pushes for the Russell 3000 index to have at least 20% women directors on its boards. Last year, Goldman Sachs was hired to underwrite WeWork’s IPO, which only added a female director after its initial prospectus prompted criticism of its all-male board.  
“Starting on July 1st in the U.S. and Europe, we’re not going to take a company public unless there’s at least one diverse board candidate, with a focus on women,” Solomon told CNBC Thursday. He didn’t mention Asia, which continues to lag behind other regions when it comes to board diversity.  
Next year, the bank will raise the threshold to two diverse directors, which includes diversity based on sexual orientation and gender identity, Goldman said in a statement. The bank said the decision came after it learned more than 60 U.S. and European companies in the last two years went public without a woman or person of color on the board. Goldman Sachs has four women on its 11-member board.  
Among the IPOs where Goldman Sachs was an underwriter over the last two years in the U.S. and Europe, fewer than 10% currently have a board lacking a diverse candidate, the company said. Data was not available for the composition of those boards at the time of the IPO, the company said.

U.S. stocks followed European markets down amid concern that the coronavirus could hurt the global economy.

Stocks tumbled on Monday and oil prices fell, as the spread of a dangerous virus in China raised investor worries about the global economy.

The sudden appearance of the coronavirus, which has now killed at least 80 people in China and infected others in Europe and the United States, among other countries, has pierced a calm that had settled over financial markets in recent months. Monday’s decline in the S&amp;P 500 followed a similar drop on Friday.

LIVE U
Ne 3,000 eople, mostly in China, have now contracted the disease. China extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days until Feb. 2 in an effort to limit travel and contain the outbreak that started in the city of Wuhan. On Sunday, a fifth case of the disease was confirmed in the United States.



The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 1.5 percent on Monday, with shares of airlines and companies dependent on tourism from China particularly hard hit. American Airlines dropped more than 4 percent in early trading, and Wynn Resorts, which operates casinos in Macau, a special administrative region of China and a gambling haven for Chinese high rollers, dropped more than 7 percent.

Major stock benchmarks in Europe were down more than 2 percent. While many markets in Asia were closed for Lunar New Year, Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index also sank 2 percent.

Oil prices dropped, reflecting concern that travel shutdowns and other reactions to the virus could slow the global economy, and shares of major oil companies also declined. Brent crude, the international benchmark, slipped below $60 a barrel, its lowest since October.

China’s leaders are under pressure as the epidemic spreads at an accelerating rate. Concerns have been raised that the government’s response to the outbreak, which includes a lockdown of cities that affects 56 million people, is too late and could even make the situation worse.

&gt;  
&gt;One thing that caught my eye was this.... Ill see if I can post it here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spotlight: Revenues  
&gt;  
&gt;**Matt, can you give us some idea of how these new products with impact revenue numbers?**​InnerScope has revenue models that even with the MOST conservative assumptions has EACH Kiosk generating over $10,000 per month in revenue with a HEALTHY Margin for InnerScope.  Aggressive revenue models has the Kiosks generating OVER $40,000 per month per kiosk. InnerScope has already built the strategic plan for a national roll-out of our kiosks that would feed revenue to ALL of InnerScope’s products like the Direct-to-Consumer Hearing Aids, the NEW OTC Hearing Aids, Vitamins, and the InnerScope Retail Stores. InnerScope is looking to deploy 2,500+ kiosks over the next few years and over 10,000 in the next 5 years.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Conservative model:**  
&gt;  
&gt;$10,000 per month in revenue for each Kiosk  
&gt;  
&gt;Within 2 years, company expects 2,500 kiosks.  
&gt;  
&gt;= $25,000,000.00 per month in revenues based on a conservative model.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased more than 22% in 2019 and  is already up 2.2% through three weeks of 2020, but it is about to face  its biggest test of the young year, and potentially many years.

Nearly half of the 30 Dow  [DJIA, -0.58%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) components are scheduled to  report results from the holiday season in the coming week, which will be  by far the busiest week of the earnings season.

There are 14  Dow companies expected to report, the most companies from the blue-chip  index to report in a single week since at least 2014, a group that  includes two trillion-dollar market caps in Apple Inc. [AAPL, -0.29%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote) and Microsoft Corp [MSFT, -1.01%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft?mod=MW_story_quote) Plenty of non-Dow  companies will throw their numbers in as well — 141 of the S&amp;P 500  companies are expected to report, including Facebook Inc. [FB, -0.83%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb?mod=MW_story_quote), Amazon.com Inc. [AMZN, -1.22%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc [AMD, -2.63%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amd?mod=MW_story_quote) 

The 85 members of the S&amp;P 500 that have reported results thus far  have seen net income fall by 0.3% on average from a year ago, though  Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said it’s  tough to make broader inferences from early reports given different  sectors tend to post results at different parts of the earnings cycle.  More than a third of S&amp;P 500 that have reported so far sit in the  financials sector, which could skew those results.

The  FactSet consensus currently calls for net income to fall by 1.9% for  the S&amp;P 500, based on a blend of reported results and analyst  projections, which would mean [the current earnings recession ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/earnings-recession-is-expected-to-swallow-all-of-2019-after-holiday-forecasts-disappoint-2019-11-22)would swallow all of 2019’s results.

Here’s what to watch for in the week ahead.

Such optimists have pointed out that the ultra-low level of U.S. Treasury yields could suggest relative valuations still favor stocks, and that therefore investors should keep pouring money into equities even as more skeptical analysts struggle to see how equities can keep rising on the basis of corporate earnings growth.

Analysts at Société Générale say U.S. stocks appear a much more attractive proposition over bonds thanks to the widening of the average equity risk premium, which measures the additional return investors are rewarded for owning equities over risk-free government debt. In recent months, this premium has risen due to the inability to bonds to sell off even though investors anticipate a stabilization in the global economy after the signing of the phase one U.S.-China trade deal earlier this month.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,300815,public,confidence,self,Bulls take comfort from low U.S. Treasury yields to keep pouring money into stocks,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/etwrd1/bulls_take_comfort_from_low_us_treasury_yields_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**
*****
&gt; With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.
*****
&gt; The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&amp;P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.
*****
&gt; Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed’s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.
*****
&gt; There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.
*****
&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.
*****
&gt; “It’s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.”
*****
&gt; Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.
*****
&gt; “You could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,” said Krosby. “We had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings roll out
&gt; There are more than 135 S&amp;P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald’s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.
*****
&gt; Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.
*****
&gt; “Coming into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.”
*****
&gt; Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there’s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.
*****
&gt;#  Fed is big story but won’t say much
The Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it’s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.
*****
&gt; “The big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that’s going to be the key messaging,” said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think the data has been okay. There’s really nothing new there. The only thing that’s really new or interesting is going to be what’s going on with the balance sheet.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.
*****
&gt; Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.
*****
&gt; Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed’s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.
*****
&gt; For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. “The intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed’s target range, ” he said.
*****
&gt; Besides the technical move, they “may be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Economic data
&gt; There’s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter’s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.
*****
&gt; New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid

&gt; Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.

&gt; As of yesterday’s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA’s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&amp;P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.

&gt; In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday’s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.

# Another Look At Election Years

&gt; Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn’t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.

&gt; We’ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we’d take another look at this impactful year.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500’s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.

&gt; “Stocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; From a quarterly view, the S&amp;P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That’s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.

# Recession Watch Update

&gt; As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it’d be a good time to check on LPL Research’s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.

&gt; As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn’t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle’s continued durability.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:

&gt; We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It’s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.

&gt; We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&amp;P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&amp;P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.

&gt; “We remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.”

It involved me coming in early and checking different news and company sites (\~20) for anything new that may be of interest to them. 

Being lazy I created a simple python script that would check automatically if there is anything new on those sites matching XYZ keywords and would pull all that new info into a single page. It turns out that till this day the script is being used and now I am thinking about exploring this idea a bit further.

January’s stock-market rally has seen U.S. equities hit record highs time and again, leaving the major benchmarks at lofty altitudes.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.63%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote)  has gained 2.2% so far in January, while the S&amp;P 500 index [**SPX,** **-0.87%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote)  has advanced 2.9% and the Nasdaq Composite index [**COMP,** **-0.80%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp?mod=MW_story_quote)  4.8%, setting numerous record closes along the way. This has left many market watchers worried about equity valuations and wondering whether investors are in for a nasty correction.

Depending on your valuation measure, stocks are either approaching valuations last seen during the height of the dot-com bubble in 2000, or are reasonably priced relative to history, as the following charts will illustrate.

I know correlation measures how something moves with respect to something else, and I know it can go from -1 to 1, I guess my question is, does the beta have anything to do with correlation?   Does a beta of 1 mean something is heavily correlated as well?  Or does a beta of 1 simply mean that it's just as volatile?

- This is for a Roth IRA. I'm in my 20s. 

- I want to get this decision right early one (i.e. now) so I can have a portfolio which I don't mess with ever going forward. Once I have the fund for like 5 years (hopefully stacking up lots of compounded returns) I'll be less likely to mess with it and trade around, which is I think will be very beneficial. 

- I prefer funds, so I can be 100% invested. I guess I'm a bit OCD and I hate seeing $84 left in cash. I also think that having ETFs just encourages me to check the market more often (to see my money going up or down mid-day) which encourages trading which I wont to avoid at all costs. 

- I do prefer mostly US stocks (hence only %20 international).

- I use Schwab so I can buy Vanguard funds unless I want to pay a $49 fee EACH TIME (i.e. each year) I contribute. 

- The SFENX has a .39% fee which is just kinda aweful. I'm tempted to go 100% SWTSX

* U.S. stock futures are pointing to a higher open ahead of the Friday session, with the final disposition of the holiday-shortened trading week still to be determined. The Dow is currently on track to post a losing week, its second in four weeks, while the Nasdaq is likely to rise for the seventh week in a row after a record close Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 is just below breakeven for the week, and would post its eighth weekly gain in since weeks if it can erase that deficit. (CNBC)
American Express (AXP), a Dow component, releases earnings before today’s opening bell. No major earnings reports are scheduled after today’s closing bell, and no economic reports out today. (CNBC)
* Dow stock Intel (INTC) was rising 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and revenue after the bell Thursday. Results were helped by improvement in personal computer and data center demand, and Intel also gave an upbeat current quarter outlook as well as announcing a 5% dividend increase. (CNBC)
* A large broadcast satellite, owned by AT&amp;T’s (T) DirecTV, built by Boeing (BA) and operated by Intelsat (I), suffered major damage to its batteries in December and is now at risk of exploding. The satellite is notably several years beyond its intended lifespan. (CNBC)
* Boeing reschedules 777X plane’s first test flight for today (Reuters)
* China’s National Health Commission said as many as 26 people have died from a fast-spreading coronavirus, as the total number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 830. Multiple cases of the virus have been confirmed in Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea and Japan, while the United States, Taiwan and Singapore have each reported one case. China has extended its travel ban to 13 cities, covering 35 million people. (CNBC &amp; NY Times)

China is on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, a period when the Shanghai Disney park would be usually packed with tourists. (Reuters)
* The World Economic Forum is wrapping up today in Davos, Switzerland. A Hong Kong property developer said the U.S. chose the wrong decade to start a trade conflict with China. “They should have picked the war 10 years ago,” said David Chiu, chairman of Far East Consortium International. (CNBC)

* Soros says Xi is the ‘most dangerous’ opponent of those who believe in open society (CNBC)
* Soros warns Trump of potential economic doom before election (CNBC)
* Soros says Elizabeth Warren ’is the most qualified to be president’ (CNBC)
* Democrats will press their final day of arguments today before skeptical Republican senators at President Trump’s impeachment trail, focusing on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress’ investigation. House prosecutors made an expansive case yesterday that he abused power like no other president in history, swept up by a “completely bogus” Ukraine theory pushed by attorney Rudy Giuliani. (AP)
* Former VP Joe Biden leads other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, while several others appeared to be gaining momentum in their bid for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll. The online poll showed that 24% of registered Democrats and independents supported Biden, while 20% backed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and 12% said they would vote for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren.
* The Trump administration is set to release a report today that outlines its short-term and long-term plans for enlisting e-commerce companies to combat counterfeit products on their platforms. The Wall Street Journal reported that law enforcement will begin identifying cases immediately and “seek all available statutory authorities to pursue civil fines and other penalties against these entities.”
* J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon got a 1.6% raise to $31.5 million for his work in 2019 after his bank posted record earnings and shares of the company surged. Dimon’s compensation package includes $1.5 million in salary and $30 million in performance-based incentives. (CNBC)
* The U.S. government announced that former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf has been banned from ever working at a bank again and will pay $17.5 million for scandals in which millions of fake accounts were set up to meet sales quotas. Regulators plans to target other individuals, including former executives, for their role in the scandals. (CNBC)
* Home DNA-testing company 23andMe is laying off about 100 people, or 14% of its staff, on Thursday, in the wake of declining sales. The company plans to tighten its focus on the * DTC business and its therapeutics arm while scaling back its clinical studies arm. Additionally, TripAdvisor is planning to cut 200 jobs, or 5% of its total workforce. (CNBC)
* Jim Lehrer, co-host and later host of the nightly PBS “NewsHour” that for decades offered a thoughtful take on current events, has died. He was 85. Lehrer died “peacefully in his sleep,” according to PBS. He had suffered a heart attack in 1983 and more recently, had undergone heart valve surgery in April 2008. (AP)

Hello r/StockMarket!

I would like to introduce to you all our newest member of the mod team here at r/StockMarket, **/u/ghostoftgbt**!

I know I wrote up a little something for ghostofgbt in our [300K subscribers thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/esuabb/congratulations_on_300000_subscribers_rstockmarket/) yesterday, but I felt having a separate dedicated thread for this would be good.

For those of you who are new and are not very familiar with ghostofgbt, he has been one of our longest standing contributors, if not *the* longest standing contributor of this subreddit. About 7 years long. That is a pretty long time. Suffice to say I felt this move was long overdue. ghostofgbt's knowledge of the markets is like none I have seen or come across anywhere on the internet. We have a great friendship, and chat daily on the live chat as well.

Bringing in ghostofgbt will allow us to expand the end of the spectrum with more actionable trades, ideas, strategies, and much more.

For those of you who have not yet gotten the chance to check out ghostofgbt's weekly live streams, he is now hosting them in our [Official Discord Live Chat](https://discord.gg/p6KPJCh) every Wednesday in the #live_chat channel.

**[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/es411k/beginning_tomorrow_1222020_at_7pm_eastern_and/)** was his thread which was a big hit from earlier this week for anyone who might have missed. If any of you did happen to miss it no worries, I believe ghostofgbt will be uploading his latest stream to YouTube soon.

ghostofgbt has indicated an interest to do these weekly streams on Wednesday evenings to accommodate everyone, as that seems to be a good time for most people.

There is a lot more planned, but for now, let's leave it here and give a big welcome in to /u/ghostofgbt into the fold! :)",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,300293,public,confidence,self,"Please welcome to our new mod, ghostofgbt!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/et9gof/please_welcome_to_our_new_mod_ghostofgbt/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,

00:22...Look, if you take the history of the United States since the late 70s I would call monetary policy a policy of bubble to bubble. For instance you know to save the the economy after the stock market crash right the Fed cut rates and overinflated commercial real estate and then we had to bail out the banks with the Resolution Trust Corporation.

So then once things calm down again investors no longer thought that commercial real estate was safe and they inflated the internet bubble to the wealth effect to keep the economy going and then of course it went bust. And so then people didn't feel safe in stock so they started buying homes. We played that out and at bust and so we're my attitude is when you look at the amount of leverage in corporate America and where we are today you've you definitely are inflating a bubble here in credit...

Morgan chief Jamie Dimon blames U.S. public policy for sluggish growth over past decade** 

Jamie Dimon doesn’t have much positive to say about negative interest rates in Europe and Japan or public policy in the United States during the past decade.

The **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co**. [**JPM,** **-1.08%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/jpm?mod=MW_story_quote)  Chairman and CEO blasted the policy of negative interest rates adopted in Europe and Japan during an interview Wednesday with CNBC, while arguing that economic growth in the U.S. could have been nearly double its actual rate if the government policy had been better.

Dimon took aim at fiscal and other economic policies in place at the U.S. federal level. “Over the last 11 years, we had, like, 23% growth,” he said. “We should have had 40 plus, which would have been normal. It was our own bad infrastructure policy, work skill policy, litigation, regulation, taxation, some of which got fixed,” that led to such sluggish growth, he said.

&gt;*The only thing I have trepidation about is negative interest rates, QE and the diversion between stock prices and bond prices and yields and stuff like that. It’s kind of one of the great experiments of all time and we still don’t know what the ultimate outcome is...Do you know anybody who has actually bought a negative interest rate bond? The buyers are central banks and insurance companies or index funds or passive funds. I would never buy a negative interest rate bond, unless I was forced. In history when you see something like that, it doesn’t necessarily end well.*\- Jamie Dimon

Dimon also warned that the U.S. and global economy are vulnerable to a spike in inflation that could put central banks on their heels.

This incredible performance has made it's founder Jim Simons a billionaire many times over, with an official net worth of $21.6BN.

Today, we'll take a look at Simon's story and see why he's regarded by some as the ""World's Smartest Billionaire""

**S**

Simons demonstrated mathematical prowess at a young age.

From there, Simons studied Math as an undergrad at MIT at the age of 17, graduating in just three years.

However, even he found the graduate courses (which undergrads could attend if they wanted) very difficult at the age of 17...well, initially anyway.

He completed his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley at the grand old age of 23.

He then taught Math at MIT and Harvard.

**SI**

In 1964, he began working for the Institute for Defence Analysis (IDA) at Princeton.

The IDA was a super secret branch of the NSA aimed at breaking Cold War codes, and the work Simons did remains confidential.

Simons enjoyed this arrangement as the IDA payed well, and it allowed him to spend half of his time cracking codes and half of his time on his own Mathematical Research.

The experience also gave Simons his first real taste of computers and the utilisation of algorithms.

However, four years later in 1968, he got fired from the IDA after stating his views against the Vietnam War in an interview - claiming that he would only working on his own work until the Vietnam War ended.

He protested his firing to no avail.

**SIM**

He then became Chairman of the Math department at Sony Brook University.

Stony Brook was flush with cash at the time as Governor Nelson Rockefeller (grandson of John D. Rockefeller), recommended a major new public university be built on Long Island to ""stand with the finest in the country""

Simons helped to transform Stony Brook into a world-class math department.

In terms of his own Mathematical work, Simons mainly focused on the geometry and topology of manifolds.

He co-developed Chern-Simons theory, which has been found applications in string theory.

**SIMO**

His first experience in business came during his days at MIT.

Simons had two friends from Bogota, Columbia (no they were not in that business...)

He had spent time with them at MIT and thought they were smart, and after hearing Columbia was a good place to start businesses in certain sectors.

During his graduate studies at Berkeley, Simons got married and received $5000.

He headed to the Merrill Lynch office in San Francisco and invested in two stocks.

However, he wanted something more exciting - so opted for high leverage soybean futures!

In the mid-70s, using some of the profits from the Columbian business, Simons started to get involved with foreign currencies.

Simons hired world class cryptanalyst Lenny Baum to begin the journey of making the strategy more systematic.

They had some early success, with the pound for example.

However, they were trading fundamentally at the time, and Simons knew that there was an element of luck to what they were doing, and wanted to remove this element of chance and make things more systematic.

He set up Medallion in 1988. However, they were losing money very early on so he actually closed the fund to investors to have a 'study period' and see what was going wrong. Some investors at this point took their money and ran, but many had faith in Simons, and that faith certainly payed off.

Simons and his team refined their approach and opened the fund back up, and since then it's fair to say Medallion went from strength to strength.

**SIMON**

Simons is also notorious at RenTec for having stringent NDAs (non-disclosure agreements). These are lifetime NDAs.

As well as this, if an employee has been there for a few years, then they have the option of signing a non-compete to grant them access to a larger share of the Medallion bonus pool (or rather bonus ocean).

He does not entertain the prospect of someone applying RenTec's intellectual property elsewhere.

For example, two Physics PhDs from MIT Alexander Belopolsky and Pavel Volfbeyn joined RenTec in 2001 (ironically both Russian).

They quit in mid-2003 to join Israel Englander's hedge fund Millennium Management.

Volfbeyn and Belopolsky had signed NDAs prohibiting them from using or sharing Medallion’s secrets.

They had however refused to sign non-compete agreements, though, viewing the firm as underhanded for slipping them in a pile of other papers to be signed, according to a colleague.

With no signed non-compete agreement to worry about, Englander figured he had the right to hire the researchers as long as they didn’t use any of Renaissance’s secrets.

RenTec wasted no time suing for intending to violate its trade secrets.

The outcome?

Englander’s firm agreed to fire Volfbeyn and Belopolsky and pay RenTec $20 million.

*Don't mess with RenTec's IP*.

**SIMONS**

Simons tells an interesting story about a particular astrophysicist that turned down the opportunity to join RenTec: the astrophysicist was giving a talk and Simons offered him a job on the spot.

The dude said ""Not right now, I'm part of a Physics project that I want to see through""

The guy and his team won a Nobel Prize for this 'Physics project'!

Simons has repeatedly emphasised that his success in management has been the relentless focus on hiring the smartest people and providing them with an infrastructure to flourish.

They have fantastic incentives, a collaborative environment, and world-class infrastructure that they can fit into easily.

**SIMONSA**

Simon's favourite algorithm?

That's confidential...

**SIMONSA 68**

However, there has been some form of controversy - specifically regarding the IRS.

In 2014, a bipartisan Senate panel estimated that Medallion investors had underpaid their taxes by $6.8BN over over more than a decade by masking short-term gains as long-term returns.

This centred around transactions known as basket options with banks such as Deutsche and Barclays - through which profits from rapid day-to-day trading (usually subject to higher income tax rates) were converted into lower-taxed, long-term capital gains.

The IRS is seeking billions of dollars in back taxes, penalties and interest.

In conclusion, Jim Simons has had an extraordinary life with an array of outstanding achievements.

Unlike Warren Buffett, he is not a household name in the wider public consciousness, but his life would certainly be fitting of a movie. And a fascinating one at that.

On YouTube all I ever saw were creators with hundreds of thousands of dollars in their accounts showing the benefits of investing. The problem is seeing that as a new investor made me hesitate to take the leap because I felt I did not have enough money to take the risk with such a little reward. Man was I wrong and it took me a few years to realize that. The purpose of the channel is to show everyone regardless of your bank roll or income that anyone can invest. Being new I am looking forward to hearing from people who have experience in investing but if you would like to check out the video or come along with me for this ride please feel free to click this link to watch the newest episode  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU1U\_zO\_2Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU1U_zO_2Q).

How to start investing in the share market. A guide for beginners.

- January 22, 2020

How a Beginner can Start Investing in the Share Market??


Investing in stocks is an excellent way to grow your wealth. But how do you actually start? Not to worry, in the following paragraphs, I'll explain how actually you can make your first investment in the share market.

￼How to start investing in the share market?


Share market is a very ignored investment option in India because we have been told by our elders that investment in share market is a gambling.


If you look at historical records, returns given by the stock market is much higher than other forms of investments.

For example, Sensex has been a barometer for the Indian economy. Sensex has given more than 17% of compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) and in the same period, Gold has given only 10% of returns.


Sensex has given a CAGR of over 17% which is a much higher return than any asset class in India. And if you had invested Rs.10,000/ in Sensex 40 years back, then your corpus today would have been worth of Rs. 45 Lakh. The same amount invested in the Gold for the same period would be worth Rs. 4 Lakh today and in the bank, FD would be worth over Rs. 2.5 Lakh.


Know Your Basics First

Before you start investing, it becomes imperative that you should know the basics of the stock market.


Learning the basics of the stock market are paramount. You can't survive in the market if you don't know the basics of it. Take some time to learn the basics and also learn about individual stocks that make the market.


There is an old adage, ""It is not a stock market, but a market of stocks"". 


So you must focus primarily on learning about individual stocks unless you are not buying ETF (ExchangeTraded Fund).


The following areas that you should focus on and be familiar with these areas before you make an investment in the share market.


- Important Ratios and Their Significance

- Methods of Stock Selection

- Learning About Types of Orders

- Opening of a Demat Account


Let's start the journey together to learn the basics that can help you in making your first investment in the share market.


Important Ratios and Their Significance

Knowing the important financial ratios and their significance will help you to make a wise investment decision. Understand the definition of these ratios and know how to use them effectively. These financial ratios such as Price to Earning ratio (P/E ratio), Return on Equity (ROE) &amp; Return on Assets (ROA) etc are very important to know in making any investment in the stock market. Learn how to use and calculate these ratios and also learn to compare different companies using these metrics.


Methods of Stock Selection 

You should understand what actually fundamental and technical analysis means. How both differ with each other? How actually you can use them while analysing a company? Know which one suits your way of investing. Also, you should know what kind of approach you are going to adopt fundamental or technical. Decide whether you are an investor or trader and if you decided to become an investor you should be knowing about fundamental analysis and if you have decided to be a trader then you should learn about technical analysis.

Learning About Types of Orders

Making any kind of investment you must have knowledge about types of orders used in the share market. These orders include limit order, market order, stop-loss order, stop market order, cover order and bracket order. You have to use any one of the above-mentioned orders while executing a trade in the share market. In order to enhance or improve your accuracy in executing orders, you must have thorough knowledge about each order and its use.


Opening of Demat Account 

What is a Demat account? It is nothing but a dematerialized account that keeps an electronic record of the stocks you own, making the physical share bond obsolete.


It is a must for an individual who is planning to buy or sell shares and can also be used to hold shares in the electronic form.


In order to make an investment in the share market, a Demat account is mandatory.


How to Manage Risk

As we all know that share market is associated with risk and if you failed to manage the risk you may end up losing all your money. 


There are many ways to reduce your risk but the popular way is to diversify your exposure means diversification of your portfolio.


It is prudent to invest in stocks of different companies in different industries. By doing this you can reduce your risk and you can expect that single bad event will not ruin all your capital.


Closing Thought 

Investment in share market historically has enjoyed more return than any other asset class. It also provides you with easy liquidity and gives you the ability to track your investment.


Investment in share market is a great opportunity to convert your small account into a large one. Be a good saver and invest consistently. The better way to begin your journey of investing in the share market is adopting a systematic investment approach. Start slow, be consistent and patient. 


Your patience will help you to realise the magic of compounding.


The early you start investing, the greater your final result will be.


"" Compound Interest is the eighth wonder of the world, he who understands it, earns it and He who doesn't, pays it,"" Said, Albert Einstein.

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

In case you didn't make it to [**last week's live stream**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPUF7OOG0U), I'm excited to share that tomorrow, 01/22/2020 at 7PM eastern in the [**Official /r/StockMarket Discord**](https://discord.gg/p6KPJCh) we'll begin a new, completely free set of lessons on how to effectively navigate the US stock market, dubbed **MARKET ESSENTIALS**. 

I'll be leading these lessons myself, sharing what I've learned in my 15 years of experience in the markets, 10 years of learning from and trading with some of the best traders on the planet, 5 years of trading full time and multiple years of experience as a mentor and educator in the markets and finance-focused software development.

This week is the very first module, so we'll start with the absolute basics, such as what a stock is and why they're issued, how to select a broker, different styles of trading/investing, the basics of how to read stock charts, market indexes and the broad methodologies people use to analyze the markets.

Moving forward, we'll focus on a new topic each week for several months, covering the following broad topics, among others, in great detail:

- Market Fundamentals
- Identifying Trading Opportunities
- Broad Market Analysis
- Risk Management
- Technical Analysis
- Fundamental Analysis
- Level 2 and Time &amp; Sales
- Tracking Trading Performance
- Options Trading

As always, this is 100% free and open to everyone so please come join and ask questions!

Here are the details:

Some things I mention I have seen data on, but I don’t remember where I saw them enough to cite specific numbers. If you do have data one way or another please feel free to share!*

So as we enter the 11th year of a bull market I’ve been wondering whether the market is still the same as it was pre-2008. We all keep fearing that a recession is bound to come up sooner or later, and we all are pointing to common indicators that frequently show the market is due for a down turn (inverted yield curve, record valuations, slowing global economy, etc.). Yet, other than a correction in 2018, that was negated by a strong 2019, none of those indicators have bore fruit. Based on my own observations I would be inclined to point to 3 reasons this is the case (alliteratively, of course): people, policy, and passive investing. 

1) People: Much like myself, many of the people working in the market now have never worked through a major market downturn, all we’ve known is up (and the one time the market went down the next year it had one of its best years in recent history). We’ve also seemingly bought into these ideas of “unlimited growth potential” with things like tech and FAANG, as well as a preference for “growth over profits” (which could go away after the WeWork fiasco, but we’ll have to wait and see). It just seems like there’s such a recency bias in the market right now, and the market won’t go down simply because people don’t want it to. 

2) Policy: With the introduction of QE after 2008/2009 the Fed has basically given itself a third mandate. The Fed’s dual mandate requires them to keep prices stable, and work towards full employment, but after the introduction of QE it feels as if they’ve added “prop up struggling markets” to that list. It certainly doesn’t help when you have a president who keeps calling for lower and lower rates, but the Fed is meant to be somewhat independent in its actions. Still, the market had a hiccup and immediately the Fed came to lower rates and prop it up, essentially saying that it would always come in the help a struggling market. 

3) Passive Investing: Passive investing has made it extremely easier for anyone to be an investor, and this isn’t a bad thing. More and more people are taking advantage of new products, giving them opportunities for financial security, but institutions are also starting to follow this trend. Many large pensions, and other foundations and endowments, are starting to move away from active investment and into passive funds. Rather than give money to active stock pickers, these large funds are allocating based on risk appetite into funds that simply replicate the market using beta weighting and volatility measures. While this is a less risky method, it also creates a self fulfilling prophecy. The highest weighted stocks in those indexes continue to get bid up as more and more capital flows into these passive funds. And this is done irregardless of the actual attractiveness of those investments. You might say, “The market will correct that and the indexes will adjust”, but as more and more capital becomes passive this becomes harder and harder. With fewer active investors the chances of proper market valuations being recognized gets lower. (An analogy I’ve heard and liked is drunk people at at bar. There used to be enough sober people at the bar to make sure that all the drunk people got home safe. But now the sober people are getting drunk and can’t even get themselves home, so we’re all stuck wandering around lost.)

This all leads me to wonder: has the market fundamentally changed, and are all those “historical” trends we like to reference even valid now? I’d love to hear some other people’s thoughts or observations (both for and against what I’ve pointed out).",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,298966,public,confidence,self,Has the market changed?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ervrj9/has_the_market_changed/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],

While they are impossible to ignore this is not the .com bubble. 

1.—One thing that could set off a correction would be earnings being very weak and with consistent earnings over the next few weeks here’s why I don’t think earnings will cause a pullback. PHASE 2!! Trump understands now more then ever just how to manipulate the markets for his benefit. I bet they have a road map laid out of good news to combat bad news with. I’m saying that if a bad stretch of earnings comes out don’t be surprised if it is counteracted by trade news out of Washington.

2– a chart of Stocks above there 200 day moving averages has been a signal of impending doom when this measure goes above 80%. While we are almost there the two worst crashes saw this metric stay above 80-90% for 6-8 months before the selling took hold. 

As I said we aren’t even to the danger signal yet, but will be in the next few weeks. As far as I can tell anything this is the type of number that could hover around here for quite awhile, especially with things as they are now. There is so much cash, so they say anyway, on the sideline, the ten year is so low and a president that will probably do anything to avoid a crash in an election year. 

3. Here’s something you won’t hear on tv. When examining trend lines and reversion to the mean you will notice the inevitable; markets are never correct( my opinion) so if you go back and just look at past bubbles and compare them to, pretty much a straight line you can draw yourself, this is a place to actually do some math and figure out what sort of percentage point drops to expect. Us being in an unprecedented era of the cheapest money ever is a big chip here and why comparing this to 2000 shouldn’t be done. Inflation alone guarantees a bigger market which could easily support much bigger moves but we all know there is more to average in then just inflation when comparing now til then. 

4. The fed seems to actually be doing what trump wants. Can you imagine if they came out and said they might raise rates next time, and they should. The chances of that happening seem so slim. 

5. So phase 2 talk will get us through earnings and then the phase 2 signing prolly will combat the sell in may swoon. Don’t forget that in May all these home refinances will show up on the banks earnings. **yeah slowly loading up on some regional and best of breed banks between now and then would be my most sound advice. 

6. FOMO ...trust me you do not want to miss out on this bull market. If trump wins it could go into 2021 and even beyond. Should he loose I don’t think it would end either but a proper reallocation would be in order.

Have you ever wanted to learn how to use python to improve your stock investing performance? I have just started a python for finance Youtube series where I share how I have created programs to scan stocks, back test strategies, and manage your portfolio.

Even if you have never programmed python is easy to learn and a great skill to have!

So far I have made 2 videos, the first is a walk-through of how to download python and then how to access and manipulate stock data to create simple moving averages

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myFD0np9eys&amp;list=PLPfme2mwsQ1FQhH1icKEfiYdLSUHE-Wo5&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myFD0np9eys&amp;list=PLPfme2mwsQ1FQhH1icKEfiYdLSUHE-Wo5&amp;index=2&amp;t=4s)

The second video teaches you how to back test strategies. The program simulates entering and exiting trades based on criteria you choose (such as a close above or below a moving average) Then it calculates key statistics that identify how effective that trading method is including batting average and total return.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYK2SNygAog&amp;list=PLPfme2mwsQ1FQhH1icKEfiYdLSUHE-Wo5&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYK2SNygAog&amp;list=PLPfme2mwsQ1FQhH1icKEfiYdLSUHE-Wo5&amp;index=3&amp;t=2s)

(CNN) The student loan burden in the US is about $1.6 trillion and rising, mostly because people have barely made a dent in paying down their loans.

That's according to a report released Thursday from credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service. While higher college enrollment rates and rising tuition costs used to the main reason for growing student loan balances, the report states that slow loan repayments have recently become the primary driver.

You can see that as soon as Trump took office, interest rates began to rise, but then they followed a pattern unlike the rest of the chart and they fell again very quickly.

I'm analysing my investment patterns and I got some correlation values within 0.4-0.6. I understand that if it gets closer to 1, then it's very strong correlation.

But I got varying sources saying that 0.4-0.6 is not strong, and some says it's depending on the field. [One such source is this one](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/soc/courses/712/chap18.html); some excerpts:

&gt;... There is no rule for determining what size of correlation is considered strong, moderate or weak ...  
&gt;  
&gt;... For this kind of data, we generally consider correlations above 0.4 to be relatively strong; correlations between 0.2 and 0.4 are moderate, and those below 0.2 are considered weak.  
&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 20th, 2020.

# **Earnings will decide whether the market continues to hit new highs after another week of records  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/earnings-will-decide-whether-market-continues-to-hit-new-highs.html)**
*****
&gt; With the Chinese trade deal out of the way, earnings could be the biggest driver for stocks in the week ahead, as big tech, financial, consumer and industrial companies report.
*****
&gt; So far, the early rush of earnings are beating estimates at a pace of about 70%. Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.
*****
&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.
*****
&gt; But it’s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market’s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.
*****
&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.
*****
&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.
*****
&gt; “2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,” said Golub. “I think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.”
*****
&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. “The first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,” Golub said. “The same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.”
*****
&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.
*****
&gt; “While everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they’re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,” he said.
*****
&gt; The hearings on Trump’s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.
*****
&gt; “Will there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,” wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. “Let’s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum — for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/‘the anti-Trump’, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the ‘anti-Trump’ vote — a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.”

# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately

&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market’s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.

# A Closer Look At Election Years

&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 31% total return.

&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.

&gt; “If an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “On the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.”

&gt; Note that a “lame duck president” means the sitting president either isn’t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a “lame duck president” both years.

&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a “lame duck president”.

&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market’s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can’t always tell you who will win in November.

# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020

&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.

&gt; We’ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market’s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “We expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “With valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.”

&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6–7% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.

&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.

# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start – But 2nd Half Is Weaker

&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today’s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.

&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.

&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.

# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks

&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month’s end.

&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth “Lame Duck” Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other “Monthly Barometers” using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite

&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing “Last 11 Mon” years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 –19.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.

&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.

&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader’s Almanac) reports at month’s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow’s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.

# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout

&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).

# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline

&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.

&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.

Founded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988.

With an average net return of 39.1% after fees.

The Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.

Since, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.

Now, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).

Medallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.

Notice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.

In 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%

**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.

That certainly beats inflation...

So, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 1: The Early Stages**

Early on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.

Remember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!

“I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,” Simons said. “A pure system without humans interfering.”

Simons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information

Straus’ was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.

He became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.

Over time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.

In fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!

At the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.

The return in 2008 is a prime example of that.

Commodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.

The fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**

Now in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the ""best math department in the world"".

Therefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.

We are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.

RenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.

The strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).

Simons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.

In 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&amp;P 500 at an unusually low level.

This test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.

It had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.

Magerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.

Finally, the simulator’s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.

The resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman’s calculations.

Only then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 3: Infrastructure**

Now I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.

Big data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.

The problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:

Building a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.

To then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.

RenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.

They have completely automated the process of signal discovery:

They don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.

RenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.

The data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.

The mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.

**CONCLUSION:**

**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**

**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**

I've been trading and investing for almost twenty years. A few years back I started figuring out how to automate my own stock research and make it more effective. I got some good progress in non-financial due diligence (which is a very interesting part of investing to me – I’ll expand later on if someone’s interested). Then, I thought that it makes sense to apply some of the approaches on financials and stared building a system that might just do that:

[Robalyst](https://robalyst.com)

It does precisely what it says – it’s a robotic analyst processing corporate earnings reports.

Normally you go to institutions with that kind of thing but when we did I began realizing that its true value lies with just about everyone who’s interested in stocks or wants to learn about companies because of his own business, work or just interest.

And that’s the reason I’m writing this: ask for your opinions and feedback.

So what does it do?

* We all know that fundamental analysis never worked.
* We all know that analysts are usually biased and what they write and say on the TV is marketing.
* We all know that when you open an earnings report you get a pile of nothing.
* How about executives that have every incentive to disclose absolutely nothing?
* What about the fact that 99% of what you read about markets and companies is noise?

Robalyst tries to fix it all.

The goal? Help you **take your own decisions**. Expand your ‘circle of competence’. Give you the few important pieces that matter. Shield you from the marketing storm of any kind of intermediaries.

Traders, investors, we’re all natural learners, critical thinkers and skeptics: have a look and shoot back with opinions and questions, no matter if you like what you see or not. It's completely free and absolutely ad-free. Thank you!",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,296843,public,confidence,self,I've been trading and investing for almost twenty years.

Brad Lamensdorf, portfolio manager for AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF[**HDGE,** **-0.19%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/hdge?mod=MW_story_quote)  , used that expression to describe what he sees in his “[**Chart of the Week**](https://www.lmtr.com/near-record-proportion-of-ipos-losing-money-is-sign-of-trouble-for-stock-market/),” which, he says, should give investors cause for concern.

The chart, pulled from [**a recent Wall Street Journal story**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/money-losing-companies-mushroom-even-as-stocks-hit-new-highs-11578608209), essentially shows how much red ink is spilling in the IPO market. As you can see, the last time this “clear danger sign” popped up was on the brink of the dot-com implosion in 1999.

As the Journal pointed out, 42% of these money-losers come from the health-care sector, where investors look to make a killing on smaller biotech stocks with big upside. Another 17% come from the technology sector.

“Over-priced IPOs usually occur toward the end of a long bull run when stocks in general become very overpriced,” Lamensdorf wrote. “Why does this happen? Generally because investors have lost their sense of reality. They are willing to buy stocks on hyped stories instead of the facts.”

In other words, investment bankers, he explained, pounce on the opportunity to stuff the stock market — or, as the expression goes, feed the pigs — with overpriced companies as long as the public has an appetite for risk.

Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

It has a high expense ratio and it's susceptible to leveraged decay. But the long-term numbers speak for themselves: [https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SSO,SPY](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SSO,SPY)

&amp;#x200B;

Let's suppose you you invest at the worst possible time in the past 20 years, September of 2007 (that's actually worse than summer of 08), and that you held until the last couple years. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at the charts (link above) which take into account fees and leveraged decay, you'll see that after 10 years it outperforms the index. 

&amp;#x200B;

More specifically, you'll see that after the crash it took the normal S&amp;P index (SPY) 4 years to get back to 0% return, whereas it took SSO an extra 1-1.5 years (about 5-6 years from the crash), about another year (about 7 years from the crash) to catch back up to the the SPY yield, and another 4-6 more years to get close to 2x-ing the SPY (got close in 2017 and currently it's close again). Keep in mind those comparisons take as a given that you invested in the worst possible time (right before the 2008 crash) and also that the market goes up (as it did) 50% over the course of the 7 years after the crash (that's about a 6% annual average return). 

&amp;#x200B;

The argument, then, is that this bet makes sense given time horizons of 20-30 years. I'm willing to make the bet that on average, over the course of say 25 years, the stock market will (1) probably have a 2008 style crash (2) and then, if that happens, it would go up at least 6% annually for 7 years after the crash (if it takes more years that's fine too).

&amp;#x200B;

And of course that's all absolutely worse case scenario. I expect it to do significantly better. If you'd have bought in, say, 2010, it was doubling the S&amp;P pretty consistently over time and after 2 years (2010 onward) it was significantly above 2x maintained until the current day (because of the compounding effect).

&amp;#x200B;
