### Market Notes:

Joe Biden was called as the winner of the U.S. presidential election over the weekend. The news was expected but has given markets some certainty moving forward.

We are still in the middle of earnings season and the market is flying. Weed plays and EV plays are being hyped. I'm cautiously looking for setups. I always look at the longer-term chart.

Markets are super bullish right now as we approach record high levels. We could see a massive rally into the end of the year. As always I'm ready for the chart to prove me wrong.

### Watchlist:

**ONCS** is a low float, watching for a setup above $5

**ONCT** is a low float, on watch

**SUP** is a lowish float, support at $4.20

**MOD** is on watch

**OCUL** has support at $12.43

**EVRI** has support at $10.40

**NBEV** watching for a setup above $3.25

**MGNI** has support at $11.75

**CYH** has support at $9

**LTHM** has support at $14

**CRON** is on watch

So the stock market and economy seems to love the fact that Biden has won the election and that the Government will likely be split with the Democrats holding the House and the Republicans holding the Senate. The fight for the senate is not over as there will be 2 important elections in early-January to decide this. Even if both the seats are won by the democrats, that would result in a tie which would then be decided by the Vice Kamala Harris but people are not talking about the filibuster problem.

The filibuster is a political procedure where members debate a proposed legislation act to delay it as long as possible and this is sometimes called as „talking a bill to death”  

For debates to end there is still a 60% majority vote required for the talks to end,so i believe there is no immiment danger for any tax raises or something landscape shatering to happen. 

The only thing that Democrats can do in Senate without this problem is appoint executive branch nominations, federal judicial appoiments and as of 2017 they can also decide on Supreme Court nominations.

So any imminent tax raises or any other more radical decisions that would affect the stock market are very unlikely.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/JQTTXPk)

A couple of things about my portofolio is that Today i went and placed a couple of orders after depositing money in my trading account and i will increase my positions in Qualcomm and Pinterest as i really like the companies as well as opening a couple of new positions like Thermo Fisher, Nike and DraftKings and i also went i placed some orders that i regret not buying earlier but i didn’t have the funds necessary available like SunRun, First Solar and Aphria as they seem to have exploded pre-market already.

I was born pretty poor and lived in a 3 bedroom house with my mother, sister, auntie and cousin.

I got kicked out at the age of 18 for outing a pedophile in the family and was homeless for two years, living on the streets, in shelters and hostels.

Then at the age of 20, in April this year I lost my job; that was the final straw. So I decided I was not going to pay rent and I was going to splurge my final pay check and then kill myself. I bought my first and last lottery ticket ever and won £92k and proceeded to blow it all within 3 months on bs stocks

Tilray ran from $4.40 to $6.70 two-three weeks ago. This was the beginning of the election cycle move they have predicted. Over the last week, it pulled back, forming a bullish inside bar/bull flag. Now the stock is surging 10% to $6.11 by lunch time. Based on the stock chart setup, this Tilray bull flag breakout stock chart has upside to nearly $12.00/share. Hedge funds are extremely underweight marijuana stocks based on a chance of a Democratic sweep. It has happened, vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris has stated they will legalize marijuana on a federal level. If that happens, these stocks are worth double or triple where they are trading. Hedge funds need to pile in prior to the election even just on the chance that happens. Tilray has a great stock chart and a ton of upside.

The flagship Pure Alpha II fund has lost 18.6% through Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter. That’s little changed from the decline it reported through the end of August.

Bridgewater, which managed $148 billion as of September, also had at least one more client pull money from its hedge funds. The Delaware Public Employees’ Retirement System recently liquidated its $180 million investment in the firm’s Pure Alpha Major Markets fund, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Alison Williams said in a note this week, citing data from Pensions &amp; Investments. In the first seven months of the year, clients withdrew a net $3.5 billion from Bridgewater hedge funds.

Lets revert to post election in 2016. As soon as market opened, it started dropping because of the shock that trump won even though he was way behind in poll results. However within few minutes or an hour or so, markets suddenly switched direction and went up like crazy, for next 2-3 days. The reason was that some people figured out that Trump will be better for markets because of less red tape and being business friendly etc. A similar scenario was noticed this time as well when tech took off thinking Trump is about to be re-elected but when reality showed otherwise, the tech and markets continued up.

Hey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next

So late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk’s prime minister, Canada’s prime minister, France’s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden’s.

So this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)

Yesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.

So all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.

There were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren’t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.

Here is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)

The US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)

The market should now turn they’re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. 

Bank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)

And as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time.

Here are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)

Nvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)

Buffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company’s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.

The company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)

The buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire’s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company’s stock as long as they believe it’s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.

I just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix’s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)

Here is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings. [EARNINGS NEXT WEEKS](https://ibb.co/JFKh6kN)

Thoughts on Nio? 

The electric-vehicle market has plenty of room for growth in China, and Nio seems to be a key player in that market. 

China definitely is pushing for EV to become the norm, and so Nio seems is good stead to keep on with their growth being as though the market and government backing are proving favourable. 

NIO announced early in October that it had delivered 4,708 vehicles in September, an increase of 133.2% year over year. 

NIO has a market capitalization of $26.6 billion and is valued at roughly 12 times this year's expected sales. 

There’s also rumours they’re moving into Europe, planning to sell 7,000 of its ES8 and ES6 SUVs on the Continent within two years.

However unlike Tesla, NIO doesn't yet have a factory of its own; its vehicles are built under contract by Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group.

Although, as part of its ""Battery as a Service"" strategy, Nio also runs battery-leasing and battery-swapping services. Essentially, the car and the battery are sold separately. Subscribers to the program can rent the battery for a monthly fee.

Having said all that, Ford and voltwagen are also moving towards EVs and have much more capital and factories of their own, so could easily outpace Nio, as could Tesla.

They’ve managed to do well in the current climate with their virtual health care offering. 

It’s has seen its shares skyrocket 146% this year, soundly beating the S&amp;P 500 and its 8.5% returns.

Virtual visits for the three-month period reached 2.8 million, a 206% increase from the prior-year period.

For perspective, Teladoc's virtual visits totaled 4.1 million for all of 2019. It's on track to smash that number this year, already reporting 7.6 million visits through the first nine months of 2020. 

As a result of the strong increase in virtual visits, Teladoc's top line also got a big boost in Q3, climbing 109% to $288.8 million

With all this being said it looks very promising and I’m considering going bullish- does anyone have any thoughts against doing so?

I see that there are 2 bids of 500 shares each at $1.00 and $0.99.  


Scenario 1: If I set my sell price at $1.00, only 500 shares will be sold. And I get $500, before paying off the fees, commissions and taxes. I will have 500 shares left unsold.

Scenario 2: If I set my sell price at $0.99, I suppose all 1000 shares would be sold, 500 to each bidder? 

Bidder B at $0.99 would get 500 shares at his bid price. So that's simple. 

Now for Bidder A who bidded at $1, would he be charged for $1.00/share (as per his bid in buy order) or $0.99/share (as per sell order)? 

* If he's charged for $1.00/share as he bidded, the extra $0.01/share would go the seller (me)? 
* If he's charged $0.99/share -- $0.01 lower than he bidded -- then he would simply not be billed for the extra $0.01 when settling his trade?

Amazon will invest about $2.8 billion in Telangana to set up a new AWS Cloud region in the southern state of India, a top Indian politician announced on Friday.

But there is a lot in it for Amazon as well. Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at consultancy firm Convergence Catalyst, told TechCrunch that by having more cloud regions in India, it will be easier for Amazon to comply with the nation’s data localization policy. This compliance will also help Amazon, which currently leads the cloud market in India, attract more customers.

AWS has courted several high-profile businesses as customers in recent years. Some of these include automobile giant Ashok Leyland, life insurance firm Aditya Birla Capital, edtech giant Byju’s, Axis Bank, Bajaj Capital, ClearTax, Dream11, Edelweiss, Freshworks, HDFC Life, Mahindra Electric, Ola, Oyo, Policybazaar, RBL Bank, redBus, Sharda University, Swiggy, Tata Sky and Zerodha.

Wondery is one of the largest independent podcasting studios and networks, reaching a monthly audience of more than 8 million people, according to Podtrac, an industry measurement firm. A price tag of as much as $400 million would surpass what Spotify paid for the Ringer and Gimlet Media, as well as what Sirius XM Holdings Inc. paid for Stitcher.

For Apple, adding Wondery would mark the tech giant’s most prominent investment in podcasting in several years. It also would immediately give the company a strong library of original content.

Apart from diligent financial analysis and modeling, the largest reason for these massive long positions is Sweden.

Sweden is a world leader of digital payments, spawning multiple large fintechs platforms, such as Swish (Sweden domestic only), Klarna (Global payments), and iZettle (PayPal acquisition). As one of the world leaders of fintech, I use what works in Sweden to project into the US.

In the latest Central Bank (Riksbanken) report, Swish (Swedish Venmo/Cashapp) has surpassed total cash usage. It's used eveywhere, by everyone. Combine this potential future with Cashapp and Venmo (both of which show profitable margins), the potential for Square &amp; PayPal is much larger than is currently priced in. These stocks may look very over valued as of now, if you draw a line between where their e wallets are now to where swish is in Sweden, they have very very far to go.

SQ is especially hot as of this week after a smash earnings, but I have a massive conviction that this isn't the last smash quarter they will have. Over the next 5 years I am extremely confident they will both outperform the market in raw e-wallet growth. For the first time, cash will be monitized by private corporations. You don't want to miss it.

I mostly made this post for people who doesn't know how far e wallets have come in frontiers. In 5 years, cash will be very very close to dead in sweden. In 20, it'll be gone. Someone will profit and perhaps become the visa / Mastercard of the new age. 

Ps: ""hur durr bitcoin &amp; crypto will deseat fiat currencies"". PayPal and Square are the two largest corporations currently investing heavily into crypto. If the stable cryptocurrencies is part of our fintech future, no large company will profit as much as they. Get in.

He has expected a downturn for 5 years now. But he is the most qualified economist (PhD Stanford) of the fund managers, and this is not a timing opinion:

""But what if valuations literally never ever visit historical norms again? Fine, let’s examine that possibility. Suppose we assume that market valuations maintain the “permanently high plateau” that Irving Fisher famously projected at the 1929 market peak. What then?

Well, let’s do the arithmetic. We know that real “structural” GDP growth over the past decade has averaged only about 1.6% annually. That’s the rate at which real GDP has grown in recent years, excluding the impact of changes in the rate of unemployment. It’s essentially the underlying economic growth that’s driven by the sum of demographic labor force growth and trend productivity growth (output = workers x output/worker). Even a 3% structural growth rate would require a near-doubling of trend productivity. Let’s be optimistic and bump expected structural growth up to 2%. Adding 2% inflation then gives us 4% nominal growth.

It’s worth noting that at the very peak of the recent economic expansion, the actual nominal growth rate of S&amp;P 500 revenues over the recent 20 years had averaged just 3.6% annually, which reflects the full benefit of stock buybacks and share reductions over that period. Likewise, the growth rate of U.S. nominal GDP averaged just 4% in the 20 years measured up to the peak of the recent expansion.

Now, suppose we also assume that the profit margins observed at the peak of the recent economic expansion will never, ever normalize. We can then expect earnings to match the growth rate of revenues, and we’ll assume that dividends do the same, leaving us with expected long-term growth of 4% all around.

Finally, let’s assume that market valuations never, ever retreat. In that case, prices would grow at the same rate as fundamentals, which gives us 4% annual capital gains for a passive investment in the S&amp;P 500. Add the current S&amp;P 500 dividend yield of 1.6% (which would also remain constant forever), and if all of these assumptions were to work out for investors, **they would imply long-term investment returns for the S&amp;P 500 of 5.6% annually. Emphatically, that figure relies on the S&amp;P 500 maintaining the most extreme valuations in U.S. financial history forever.""**",False,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,555055,public,confidence,self,S&amp;P 500 Long Term outlook- Hussman.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jpo2ai/sp_500_long_term_outlook_hussman/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has increased their ability to learn trading (so many took up hobbies) and has surged money into the market.

I believe this surge is largely in part due to re-appropriation of funds. I know just anecdotally in my house we would travel, dine out, go do whatever wherever (concerts, etc.) when it sounded good, and that was quite frequently. We have done 0 of that since March. All of that saved money (no daycare costs either) has (for me) gone into Robinhood. I have to imagine this is the case for others.

The government literally pumped a couple trillion bucks into the economy and that has also helped keep things truckin'.

I think articles like this have some merit to consider (although MarketWatch feels like it is written by a bot): [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffetts-favorite-indicator-margin-levels-and-technicals-agree-this-stock-market-could-be-in-trouble-11604512872](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffetts-favorite-indicator-margin-levels-and-technicals-agree-this-stock-market-could-be-in-trouble-11604512872)

With COVID cases ramping, I know my school district in MN (I'm an educator) is shifting to distance learning and that adds a burden on families/jobs/income/etc.

I think the being home has actually just helped so much because we just aren't spending money like we used to. However, that means I've seen TONS of things shutter in MN. So many good restaurants, gone. I don't know how long the unemployment is going to last for those folks, and I am just wondering how this all coalesces.

I am NOT doom/gloom on this and I DO believe in America (i.e., the world too) and am continuing to invest. I am playing it a little differently on weekends though and monitoring that nasty temperamental pre-market and post-market activity as the big swings keep knocking me back during those times.

I don't have a point here, just my two cents at the moment. I've been shifting out of aggressively chasing the ups and downs (since March) and looking way more at ETFs, covered calls, selling puts, and mitigating risk.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.

# **After sharp bounce, market may take a ‘breather’ on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**
*****
&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. 
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.
*****
&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.
*****
&gt; “I think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,” said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon’s Wealth Management chief investment officer. “Perhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.”
*****
&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a “blue wave,” where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.
*****
&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.
*****
&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.
*****
&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.
*****
&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald’s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.
*****
&gt; “I think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There’s still a lot to figure out here,” said Grohowski. “The equity market’s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. “What I’m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.” After the votes are all in or recounted, “a sweep is unlikely but possible.”
*****
&gt; “I think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Different than 2000
&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.
*****
&gt; “In 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. “Historically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,” said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.
*****
&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.
*****
&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October’s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.
*****
&gt; “What does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There’s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,” he said. “I can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there’s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.”

&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting

&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.

&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.

&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.

&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here’s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**

&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan’s fifth year with a split Congress – a testament to how “The Great Communicator” was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43’s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it’s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.

&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise

&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.

&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed—those out of work for 27 weeks or longer—continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “While the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,” noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “With total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there’s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.”

&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.

&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month’s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don’t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.

&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks

&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are ""looking for a correction"" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.

&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See

&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don’t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. “Once the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Of course, 2020 isn’t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.”

&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90

&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.

&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win

&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**

&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**

&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.

&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency

&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**

&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.

&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.

&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**

&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.

&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**

&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**

&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.

Stocks took a breather today, trading slightly lower after a continuous four-day rally. Market participants closely await the results of the US presidential election. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.07% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.02% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the worst, 0.26% down on the day.

Today, the Labor Department released a better-than-expected October jobs report. The report shows that there were 638,000 non-farm jobs added to the economy versus the 580,000 expectation. The unemployment rate was 6.9%, compared to the 7.6% expectation (unemployment rate in September was 7.9%). The job report is surprisingly good, given the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the United States. 

The US Presidential Election remains the key focal point for market participants and Wall Street. Because of the surge of mail-in ballots, three days after Election Day several key swing states, including Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania,  have yet to announce results. According to the Associated Press, Joe Biden has 264 electoral votes to President Trump’s 214. Candidates need 270 electoral votes to win the election. As of this morning, Joe Biden took a very slim lead in Georgia and Pennsylvania and has increased his lead in Nevada. Below are the states that have been called, according to the Associated Press:

* States called for Trump: Ky., W. Va., S.C., Ala., Miss., Tenn., Okla., Ark., Ind., N.D., S.D., Wyo., La., Neb. (4 of 5 electoral votes), Kan., Mo., Idaho, Utah, Ohio, Iowa, Mont., Fla., Texas
* States called for Biden: Vt., Va., Conn., Del., Ill., Md., Mass., N.J., R.I., N.Y., N.M., D.C., Colo., N.H., Calif., Ore., Wash., Hawaii, Minn., Ariz., Maine (3 of 4 electoral votes), Wis., Mich.

A win for Biden is looking increasingly likely, given he only needs to win one more of the battleground states in order to take the White House. During a press conference yesterday afternoon he said that he had “no doubt” that once the counting was complete he and Kamala Harris “will be declared winners.” Trump, on his part, has doubled down on his calls “stop the count”, baselessly alleging widespread fraud during the election. His campaign has already sued multiple battleground states to challenge to ballot-counting process. A vote in Miching denied Trump’s efforts. 

Despite some of the uncertainty still surrounding the election, stocks rallied strongly again in the immediate aftermath of Election Day. According to a number of analysts, traders like a divided government, where no single party would control each of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Under that scenario, major policy changes are unlikely to get advanced.

I have just started a couple of months ago the exploration of trading and the stock market in general and was going to start paper trading Nasdaq stocks. I'm from Europe and work a 9-5 job and the market opens at 3:30pm in my timezone.

Was wondering if the market still experiences volatility after 5pm my time ( 11am US time) as I read a lot about violent price action in the first 30mins of the open. Does market close experience volatility? If yes should I try and tackle more market close opportunities?

Stocks rose today, continuing the week’s rally, as investors took in developments from the 2020 presidential election, which has so far produced no clear winner. The presidential race is extremely close, with a number of consequential battle states, like Pennsylvania and Nevada unlikely to produce results until at least tomorrow. The flurry of news made for a volatile overnight session, that at one point saw the Nasdaq futures spike from being slightly down to over 4% up. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 3.85% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 2.18% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 1.35% up.

As of this afternoon, according to the Associated Press, Joe Biden has 248 electoral votes to Pres. Trump’s 214. Candidates need 270 votes to win. However, because of the surge in mail-in ballots this election due to the pandemic, counting the votes is expected to take longer than normal. Despite the race being to close to call, last night, President Trump falsely declared victory while simultaneously questioning the veracity of the election process, due to the ongoing count of mail-in ballots. Trump indicated that he was willing to challenge attempts by states to keep counting ballots after election night, despite it being well known that the surge in mail-in ballots would cause complications and slow counting. “We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop,” Trump said to a crowd of supporters at the White House. “We don’t want them to find any ballots ... and add them to the list. We’re were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.” Biden’s campaign has suggested it would be willing to fight Trump in court.

Joe Biden also too expressed confidence that the vote would go his way. “We feel good about where we are. We really do. I’m here to tell you tonight we believe we’re on track to win this election.”

In the Senate elections, the so-called “blue wave” many pundits predicted did not happen. As of this morning, Democrats only managed a net gain of one seat, whereas they needed at least three to establish a majority. Democrats missed opportunities to flip seats where they could. South Carolina and Montana were rated toss-ups, and Texas was only rated slightly Republican. If Democrats broke through in one or more of those races, it would have likely portended a good night for them. Instead, Republicans appear to have won all of them handily:

**Highlights**

* California voters carried Uber and Lyft to victory, overwhelmingly approving Proposition 22, a ballot measure that allows gig economy companies to continue treating drivers as independent contractors. Uber, Lyft, and the delivery service DoorDash designed the measure to exempt the companies from a state labor law that would have forced them to employ drivers and pay for health care, unemployment insurance, and other benefits. As a concession to labor advocates, the initiative offers a wage floor and limited benefits to drivers.
* Health-care stocks led in the 30-stock Dow, with UnitedHealth Group rallying 9% and Amgen up more than 6%. Industrials including Caterpillar and Dow Inc. The index was up more than 550 points, or 2%.
* The communication and information technology sectors of the S&amp;P 500 performed very well today also.
* The Nasdaq extended its gain to more than 4%, as each of Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft surged
* Trading volumes in currency markets were unusually low for an election night, Mr. Tew said, in part because investors and traders were reluctant to put on new positions given the uncertainty.
* Bank shares dropped Wednesday, a sharp departure from the broader market as investors bet that another round of stimulus relief will be hard to come by. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index was down 3.3% around midday. The broader S&amp;P 500 rose 3.1% in volatile trading.
* Biogen Inc (BIIB) shares rose for the day because FDA briefing documents showed the company had provided enough data to support the approval of its Alzheimer's drug. Which is a pretty big deal, shares were halted at one point finishing up the day about 45%.
* Cassava Sciences (SAVA) share were also training higher, finishing 25% up after presenting positive phase 2b data on Alzheimer's study.
* AGCO (AGCO) had target raised by:
   * Morgan Stanley $84 to $95 EQUAL WEIGHT
   * BMO Capital Markets $90 to $110 OUTPERFORM
   * Royal Bank of Canada $88 to $104 OUTPERFORM
* Alibaba (BABA) had a price target raise by Raymond James from $320 to $335 at STRONG BUY.
* Booking (BKNG) had a price target raise by Credit Suisse GRoup from $2,150 to $2,200 at OUTPERFORM. Notable because stock is at $1,670.
* Catalent (CTLT) had several price target raise by:
   * Morgan Stanley from $98 to $115 OVERWEIGHT
   * Royal Bank of Canada from $98 to $105 OUTPERFORM
   * Jefferies Financial Group $107 to $115 BUY
   * UBS $105 to $115 at BUY
* Humana (HUM) had a price target raise by:
   * Oppenheimer from $440 to $460 OUTPERFORM
   * Stephens from $450 to $490 OVERWEIGHT
* Amazon (AMZN) had an upgrade by China Renaissance Securities from HOLD to BUY and a price target raise from $3,360 to $4,000
* Baidu (BIDU) had a nice upgrade from Barclays from EQUAL WEIGHT to OVERWEIGHT, and a price target raise from $140 to $170
* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) had a nice UPGRADE from Goldman Sachs (GS) from NEUTRAL to BUY and price target raised from $84 to $96. Nice call, will be keeping an eye on this one.
* Sysco (SYY) with target raise by Credit Suisse from $76 to $80 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $60
* Alleghany (Y) with price target increase by Deutsche Bank (DB) from $785 to $800. Notable because the stock is around $580 right now.

Personal Problem: Spending hours on Reddit, Twitter, Discord etc determining which stocks are interesting or hot and why. Often missing out on stocks because I’m not up to date with this and I’m busy with other stuff. 

My Solution: Tool that tells you which stocks are being spoken about more frequently with a sentiment analysis to guide you in the right direction with your research.

1. Forecast stock prices

I am Sejuty; currently working at a FTSE 100 Asset Management Company in the UK. At the peak of the 2020 pandemic, my passion project was born - The Subtle Investor - it was my way of scripting investing knowledge to encourage everyone to start investing.

I blog at [https://subtleinvestor.com](https://subtleinvestor.com) 

and, most recently I started a YouTube Channel (to make it even more accessible for everyone).

I started a small side hustle at the age of 16 buying used bicycles, fixing them up a little, and selling at a profit. I managed to turn that into $1000 then I got accepted to a job and I worked there for a couple months and then pandemic came and I'm jobless. I was bored one day and decided to try opening up a robinhood account because they gave $5 or something and I wanted to see what's up. Fast forward to a couple months and I'm waking up early everyday and I'm this ""stock guy"". I feel like I'm in my own world. It was a VERY stressful couple of months because one side of my brain was like ""STUDY how to do better"" and other side just wanted to gamble and feel the rush that it brings. It was a UP and DOWN kind of relationship and nothing stragteric at all but I managed to turn in a profit of $3000 at the end. (The end being around June when things slowed down I just wanted to get out of this toxic relationship lol)

So Now I'm 18 years old, it's my first year in college. I have $5000 saved up in my bank and it's been sitting there, not going up or down while I'm busy studying for my classes. I want it to move up of course, but don't know how to proceed. I was thinking of starting a business or start trading for real but that takes time and I literally have no time on my hands because I'm taking more credits than the average college freshmen so life if already stressful with college.

I've heard of retirement funds but I don't want to get my money when I'm 60 or something, I want it to be fairly accessible just in case I wanna start a business or whatnot. It's like.. I have this little baby and I grew it to $5000, but now I don't have time to care for the little guy (this sounds cruel lol). I want him to keep growing though! If anyone has any advice, it would be really appreciated. Thank you all!",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,553675,public,confidence,self,"I grew my money to $5000, now I'm stuck.

Here is the real consensus [price target](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/baba/analyst-research); its $335.86. 

Alibaba is one of the biggest companies in the world with 1000’s of analysts pouring over every detail of its books. If it went up 800%, the market cap would be $ 7.4  trillion, 4x that of Apple, the first trillion dollar company in history. This is outrageous..

Is this going to last? What are the latest news in the stock market, let’s dig a little into the stock market.**

All 3 big indices had a great day yesterday as they continue to gain back momentum since late in the trading Friday as well as the Monday trading session, the Dow was up over 2% yesterday [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/1T6q4Ny) while the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq were both up over 1,7% [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/R60hShF) with the Nasdaq 100 catching up in late trading to the others after being the laggard in the group [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/58W3VLQ). Meanwhile over 80% of the companies were up in the trading sessions despite volume being mostly below the average [CHART](https://ibb.co/JR2pXkR). The biggest gainers were industrials, consumer discretionary and technology while the Energy sectors keeps trailing the market [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/cTpgKnX).

The volatility also seems to be declining as we have seen another decline of about 2,5 points, the VIX closing at 34,6 [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/yQ6QS57) this is a very good indicator that the stock market will regain momentum as it has done in the past. [MOMENTUM CHART](https://ibb.co/fS66hLH)

Meanwhile the individual investor sentiment is exactly even on a bull/bear ratio. As this I believe is a great contrarian indicator [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/B3gK7x8) , the bearish investors have been increasing by 2,3% in the last week, if this continues to climb, I believe the buying opportunities in the market will become even better. I also believe that there is lots of cash on the sidelines that could come back in the market in the coming period which will also boost the stock market.

Shares are up pretty significantly in pre-market trading with the Nasdaq 100 being almost 3% while recording this video, they were even up almost 4% at one point in earlier trading.

Yesterday most auto stocks saw a jump in value [AUTO STOCKS](https://ibb.co/D4cvWps) as a strong report from Ferrari and the increased expected demand for vehicles, especially EVs in China bumped the sector. One company that seems to be announcing good things everyday is Ford [FORD NEWS](https://ibb.co/QDZCVxY) , as the new CEO Jim Farley has done a terrific job since starting. They have great growth potential with big vehicles coming up like the Mustang Mach-E, the EV F-150 and the Bronco. Also, another big winner in the last weeks has been Nio as the company is looking to enter the European market, the shares are up huge in the past year [NIO NEWS](https://ibb.co/9tBxy3J). While the used auto car market also seems to be rising with Carvana leading the group after a great Q3 report, good growth guidance and some insider buying also. [CARVANA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Bjr7894)

Tesla was another big gainer yesterday, up more than 5%, the company finally gaining some traction after trading slight down and sideways in the last weeks, the stock has an RSI level of 51 barely while it has seen a lower and lower average trading volume. I believe they have a great edge in technology and a huge head start from all the other car makers, as I believe the company is not only valued for it’s car manufacturing but for it’s technology also, despite this I don’t think that many people take into consideration the data that the company will be able to monetize through they’re cars, especially for Insurance, Maps and Advertising, while they will also benefit from a huge increase in demand for EV cars in the next decades. [TESLA CHART](https://ibb.co/23FT43W) / [DATA OPP](https://ibb.co/Jdj0S7m) / [EV PREDICTIONS](https://ibb.co/fSJyDBk)

Some big news yesterday came from overseas as the Ant Group IPO was suspended in both Shanghai And Hong Kong [ANT NEWS](https://ibb.co/VS4LDxc) as the biggest loser from this was Alibaba who saw the stock drop more than 8% on the news the biggest drop for the company in almost 6 years when they fell almost 9% at the beginning of 2015, the company having around a 33% stake in Ant Group [BABA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Kxg4wJX). Ant issued a statement in which they apologize for the event and stated they will try to resolve the problem as soon as possible [ANT STATEMENT](https://ibb.co/dtYTs4P) as they were on the way to become the biggest IPO in history at over 34,5 billion dollars. I don’t believe this will be the end of Ant Group, it may be delayed and the company may not have such a big IPO, but I still believe this will be a great company in the future, as they’re addressable market is huge and they already have over 800million accounts. [ANT IPO FORECAST](https://ibb.co/Y0yjG7t)

And if you do like Ant Group I think that PayPal is trading at a bargain price after the stock has dropped from the all time high of 215$ to 177$ [PAYPAL CHART](https://ibb.co/LxwRhw2). That is a lot of room for growth with very good results being ignored by investors due to the lack of great guidance for next quarter, but I expect the company to have great success in the Fin-Tech industry which will continue to see a boom [PayPal Earnings](https://ibb.co/F39YMhj) .

One other company that seems to be undervalued compared to the rest of the tech stocks seems to be google as investors didn’t buy the growth of this company as much as the others with Q2 revenue growth rate being negative, that was just an anomaly in my opinion as the company saw a 14% increase in growth revenue this quarter. [Google STOCK](https://ibb.co/X8NFx8t)

I believe this company has great growth potential in the cloud business as well as YouTube, so they dominate the search engine market and have a P/E of only 31. I see great room for growth for this company.

Good news for online retailers continues to come in as Wayfair crushed estimates yesterday with a huge beat , the company also saw a increase in revenues of over 60% year over year as the active customers also increase more than 50% year over year, the shares jumped a lot yesterday, erasing most of the loses from October [Wayfair Earnings](https://ibb.co/3SG8rSx) . This is great news for companies like Amazon and Shopify who saw the stock value drop despite beating earnings.

When everything is legal, these institutions will eventually be able to overwhelm state capital in this field, which is a structural advantage after monopoly.

The most fundamental reason for Ant’s postponement of listing is to touch the cake of the bank. The only way to buy the five funds is through Alipay. 

Systemic risk. ""Fintech companies' products such as ""Huabe"", ""White Tiao"", and ""Willful Payment"" have no essential difference between their cores and credit cards issued by banks. They also have the functions of credit supply and installment payment. Expenses are the main source of its profits; products such as ""borrowing"", ""gold bars"", and ""micro loans"" are not essentially different from the small loans provided by banks.""

Ant Financial does not need to back bank-level supervision, and can naturally increase its leverage to expand its capital volume.

Use other people’s money to form a pool of funds, use other people’s money to lend, and then collect money in the name of technology. Is this determined by technology or by monopoly? There is nothing wrong with this game, and 70% of the loan proceeds go to Jack Ma; when something happens, 98% of the losses belong to others (and most of them are banks).

**So the reason why Ant Financial stopped is probably very simple:**

### Market Notes:

There are three kinds of people in this world; people who can count and people who can't.

It's been comical reading social media where plenty of people have prematurely declared victory for their side. I'm waiting for projections from multiple sources at this point.

Key metrics in the election have yet to be called. At writing the Democrats are projected to maintain control of the House of Representatives but the Senate and the White House are still up for grabs.

Futures have been all over the place overnight. Spiking as Trump appeared to have an advantage and crashing as Trump appeared to declare victory and call the election rigged. At one point Nasdaq futures were briefly halted limit up at +5%.

I've been watching betting odds which gave Biden the advantage coming into the race. But flipping overnight at one point giving Trump an 85% chance of winning. At writing, odds are 60/40 back in favor of Biden.

Hold on for a wild ride the rest of the week as the election is being sorted it. Futures are mixed at writing.

In addition to basic necessities, a new class of cold-weather products, like propane heaters and fire pits, are also subject to price gouging as consumers find ways to extend the use of outdoor spaces.

A new survey from Inmar Intelligence shows that roughly 57% of shoppers are considering restocking in fear of a ""potential second wave of COVID-19"" and the consequent vacant grocery store shelves. Inmar, a technology and data analytics service, found that 27% of those shoppers are concerned about the safety of in-store shopping in the likelihood that a second wave occurs, casting a heightened spotlight on e-commerce platforms.

Stocks added to Monday’s gain in the final market session before the US presidential election. Market participants weighed a host of different outcomes for the election against the backdrop of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, economic strain, and heightened social unrest. 

The indices traded choppily but ended the day in the green. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.73% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 2.73% up as well, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, up 2.02%.

Regardless of who wins the presidency, the result is very likely to drive short-term volatility, especially given the political divide and social unrest present in the United States. Any potential outcome from the election is likely to disappoint a large portion of the population, leading to uncertainty and anxiety that could inject volatility into the market. For example, after the 2016 election, the S&amp;P 500 future slumped around 5%. The index went on to recuperate these declines to finish 1% higher by the end of the first post-Election session. Neil Shearing, chief economist for Capital Economics said, “The experience of 2016 suggests that investors should be careful about taking strong positions on political outcomes and, worse, mechanically translating those to market outcomes.”

Given the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a surge of early and mail-in voters this year. This could potentially mean that the results of the elections may not become until later on in the week, an outcome sure to negatively affect the markets. According to the US Elections Project,as of this morning, more than 100 million Americans cast their votes early, more than ⅔ the total numbers of voters during the 2016 election. According to Yahoo Finance, if turnout like this holds up, this election could have the highest voter turnout in 100 years. According to Quinnipiac’s final pre-election poll, Joe Biden has an edge in the national polls. However, when looking at key swing states, Biden’s lead is considerably narrower.

The US Senate is also holding elections this year. The combination of which party takes control of the White House and Senate is another issue of major concern. According to Blackrock Analysts, “We believe a Democratic sweep could pave the way for a new round of large-scale fiscal stimulus and boost spending on clean energy, transport, and housing. It may also bring higher taxes for companies and the wealthy. A Biden win with a Republican-controlled Senate would likely lead to much less fiscal stimulus, little public investment, and no major tax changes,” the analysts said. Fiscal stimulus under a second Trump term may lie somewhere between these two scenarios, we believe, while public investment could be similarly small as under a Biden divided government.”

Is tech going to sink? Why did PayPal drop after good earnings and apple announces new event next week, let’s talk about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Welcome I am going to react to the stock market news on movements from yesterday and what i expect next.

So, the stock market has done pretty well this year especially the tech heavy Nasdaq, being up more than 21%, while the broader S&amp;P 500 is barely up and the Dow industrial is down for the year. [YEARLY CHART](https://ibb.co/HtxbKGf)

In the last week or so we have seen the VIX testing the 40 level but being rejected every time so it seems that there is enough confidence in the stock market for it not to collapse like back in march.[VIX](https://ibb.co/WvJP6FC)

Yesterday we saw the Dow Jones rising 1,6% or 423 points [CHART](https://ibb.co/Jc3SDTk) , the S&amp;P rose by 1,22% [CHART](https://ibb.co/FBZSM2r) and the Nasdaq was the laggard only up 0,42% [CHART](https://ibb.co/55jSMzV)

While the strong economic reports that came in helped the stock market to rally, as the stock market was also helped by technical support and finally ended the selloff of October by bouncing of the SMA 200 [BOUNCE CHART](https://ibb.co/Ntqwh79) . As manufacturing PMI rose to 59,3, a number not seen in over 2 years [PMI](https://ibb.co/kgTMyrG) [PMI2](https://ibb.co/CsCrwVp)

The US manufacturing activity accelerate with new orders jumping to the highest level in nearly 17 years, the Chinese and Europeans also saw manufacturing sped up in the last month [MANUFACTURING](https://ibb.co/SsCxSg4)

Here is the heat map for the S&amp;P from yesterday, you can see that the big names dragged the market down while most of the smaller companies were in the green to start November [S&amp;P HEATMAP](https://ibb.co/SV569t0)

big companies in the tech sectors Apple, Amazon Facebook and Microsoft closed in the red yesterday while Alphabet continued to rise on the back of improved earnings and growth guidance. [TECH EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/BgNNZdH)

PayPal reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company beat the estimates of earnings per share by more than 10% and saw a revenue increase of almost 25% year over year. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/NpwwYB5)  This was the strongest ever quarter for growth in total payments for PayPal. While the earnings jumped more than 121% since last year. [QUARTER OVERVIEW](https://ibb.co/NWCxfGJ) The Company also saw a increase more than 15million new active accounts in q3 up to a total of 361 million accounts, up more than 50% year over year while the free cash flow for the company also is up more than 40% year over year [Q3 STATS](https://ibb.co/W2yxqYk)

While the operating margin was also up significantly since last year both on a GAAP and Non-GAAP accounting so the company seems to have a great future ahead with growth widely available on an international basis. [BALANCE SHEET](https://ibb.co/BLsvtHj)

The company did drop in after market about 5% do to the lack in guidance for next year, but the lack in guidance for next year is very widely spread, as not many companies know what exactly will happen in the near future, but I don’t expect anything bad for PayPal to happen, as the company also announced recently that they will accept bitcoin storage and payments within the subsidiary Venmo. [Bitcoin on PayPal](https://ibb.co/zhMt1Qy)

Apple announced yesterday that next Tuesday they will have an event in which they are expected to showcase the new Macs, the first ones to have internally designed processors, [Apple News](https://ibb.co/sKPR4ZM)  this Is a move away from Intel provided chips which I believe will further enhance performance and will eventually reduce costs for the company, resulting in a increase in gross margin for the products.

Also, Microsoft just confirmed that the new Xbox series will also make Apple TV available on the console, that means that Apple TV is available on all next gen consoles with Sony’s PlayStation 5 offering the service also [Microsoft - Apple TV](https://ibb.co/b6H7rWR)

This will likely be a boost for the service, apple really seems to be going all out to increase the services revenue which I believe is the right way to go, as the physical products are lasting longer and are not renewed ever year like in the past, this increase in services will make up for that lack of product sales. [iphone Revenus](https://ibb.co/pQCncWQ) Also recurring subscriptions revenue are more profitable for the company and are far more important in the eyes of the analysts. [Services REvenue](https://ibb.co/ggJ1txm)

Apple is one of the best, if not the best companies to own in your Portofolio as they are both a growth stock and a value stock since they do give out dividends. The company has given almost half a trillion dollars to shareholders and has many growth drivers like I said, the services, the new iPhone 12 that has the potential to be a super cycle and the company finally launching they’re own online sales in India.

With tech earnings coming in last week all delivered good beats on estimates. Google recovered from a Q2 slump in ad sales, as the biggest growth provider in the company was YouTube.  [TECH EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/BgNNZdH)

While Facebook revenue increased 22% year over year the company seems to be in a difficult position going forward due to privacy issues both from the US government and from the changes that Apple will make which will impact a large base of users.

Twitter was the one that disappointed the analysts the most, as the increase in users was minimal but ad sales did grow. Still the stock plummeted more than 20% after earnings.

Pinterest saw a huge jump after the sales rose by 58%, as they become more popular and the customer base in more than 60% woman who decide the household buying they stand to see an increase in ad sales in the future also. [PINTEREST](https://ibb.co/vv1wR9Q)

I believe that for Google and Facebook the most important thing at this moment is that they continue to grow the revenue from the huge amount of people that already use they’re services, while for the smaller companies it is far more important that they grow they’re user base, that ultimately will attract more ad revenues.

Peloton will report alongside Alibaba on Thursday after the market is very interesting to watch, that stock has dropped from it’s all time high about 20% but I can see that bouncing back if the numbers that are reported and guidance for next quarter comes in better than expected. (Full disclosure I am long Peloton) [Peloton](https://ibb.co/YyVxfxN)

Meanwhile Walmart, the biggest private company by number of employees in the world announced on Monday that they will stop using robots to keep track of inventory, despite the retailer not saying why the cut of the robots, I believe that for the moment it’s more efficient and cheaper that those jobs be done by the workforce. [Walmart](https://ibb.co/2PMx2s6)

So I strongly believe we should mostly trust the portofolios that we have build and not make any big changes as markets can seem chaotic. I believe that it’s almost impossible to time the market correctly and can hurt our returns if we are to sentiment driven.

Thank you for reading, please leave your opinion below, i will try to respond to everyone!

### Market Notes:

Today is the day. Be sure to get out and vote if you haven't already.

Election results may or may not be in tonight. The market will likely settle down a bit if we have winners in all the critical races. Failure to produce clear results will likely drive continued volatility.

Markets swung dramatically yesterday. I expect more of the same today. Futures are sharply higher at writing.

I might stay cash today and wait for calmer waters. There's always another trade.

with Dividends"" is a great book that provides a foundational understanding of Dividend investing. The pdf can be found here: [http://psulibrary.palawan.edu.ph/wtbooks/resources/pdf/908250.pdf](http://psulibrary.palawan.edu.ph/wtbooks/resources/pdf/908250.pdf)\n   * It is around 200 pages but is a very easy and informational read. Even if you are familiar with dividend investing, it can be useful to read up on certain chapters that you are unfamiliar with\n* There are basic ideas fundamental to dividend investing\n   * Dividend Compounding/Reinvesting, Dividend Yield, Dividend Growth, Payout Ratio\n   * Dividend Company Categorization: Dividend Champions, Dividend Contenders, etc. \n   * Dividend ETF\'s: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp)\n   * Drip Investing: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp)\n\n**How to Pick Dividend Stocks?**\n\n*  Spreadsheet of dividend paying companies along with key metrics \n   * [https://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp](https://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp) \n      * Since the users are international, this tool does have dividend data for Canada, Europe, Eurozone, and UK\n      * The only downside of this tool is that it is updated monthly. Therefore, I would recommend using it to find dividend stocks you are interested in and to put them on your watch-list.\n      *  I created a website that collects the same data as dripinvesting but uses an API to update daily. Due to self promotion rule, please feel free to pm for a link. The tool below is similar but less detailed.\n* Dividend Screener Tool\n   * [https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/screener/](https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/screener/)\n   * Has several important metrics but not as comprehensive as the spreadsheet above\n* Checking historical performance\n   * [http://www.tickertech.com/cgi/returns.mpl?symbol=O&amp;smonth=01&amp;sday=01&amp;syear=1995&amp;emonth=10&amp;eday=29&amp;eyear=2020&amp;compareto=SPY&amp;other=](http://www.tickertech.com/cgi/returns.mpl?symbol=O&amp;smonth=01&amp;sday=01&amp;syear=1995&amp;emonth=10&amp;eday=29&amp;eyear=2020&amp;compareto=SPY&amp;other=)\n   * I especially like this tool because you can compare the value of an investment in a stock over time with dividends reinvested\n* Understanding your own personal goals\n   * This is honestly one of the most important things in my opinion. Depending on your goals and timeline, the metrics you value will vary. With that said, you must acknowledge that dividend investing is a long term investing strategy. Compounding takes years and requires reinvesting dividends. You can use this tool to determine what kind of dividend yield and compounding you would need to reach your goal: [https://www.dividend-calculator.com/monthly.php](https://www.dividend-calculator.com/monthly.php)\n\n**Tracking Your Dividends**\n\n* DivTracker (app, free): Tracks your portfolio value, yield on market, yield on cost, yearly income, cost basis, and has several cool features.

Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.

After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.

On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.

Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus 

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until “at least 2023”. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed’s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, “too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.”

On Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.

The US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. 

Last week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it’s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).
* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.
* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!
* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles’ Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles’ Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles’ Day last year. Amazon’s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.

This  video is about the 12 habits of successful stock investors.  I'm trying to share my knowledge of some of the habits that have helped me improve on my stock investments over the years.

Investing in stocks is an excellent way to grow wealth. For long-term  investors,  stocks are a good investment even during periods of the  market  volatility — a stock market downturn simply means that many  stocks are  on sale.

If you've never invested  in the stock market before, it can be an  intimidating process. Stocks  are not like savings accounts, money market  funds, or certificates of  deposit, in that their principal value can  both rise and fall. The  stock market can be risky and if you don’t want to lose your money,   here are some important tips you need to know. We asked Successful Stock   Investors to tell us about their habits that made them rich.

### Market Notes:

It's Monday, it's November, and the big election is tomorrow. As American's brace for what's to come the market is already reacting strongly.

Last week was a bloody week for Wall Street. The worst week ever before a presidential election.

The COVID-19 pandemic isn't slowing down. New lock-down measures were put in place across Europe over the weekend. And States in the U.S. are being pushed to the brink.

Futures are higher this morning. I'm not convinced it will hold. Watching for A+ setups only today. Locking in profits quickly. I'll have a little more confidence once the election is settled.

### Watchlist:

**BBW** is a low float, support at $4

**ZDGE** is a low float, watching for a setup above $3.50

**MGI** is a low float, support at $5

**OIIM** is a lowish float, resistance at $6.55

**AIRI** is a lowish float, resistance at $1.50

**AVID** has resistance at $9.60

**DBVT** has support at $2.60

**DSKE** watching for a setup above $7

**TROX** has resistance at $10

**CYH** has support at $6, resistance at $6.25

&gt; The next question
everybody always asks
today and asked me back in
2000 is, “What do you think
is going to cause a
reversion?” Even having
lived through it, it is difficult
to pinpoint what caused the
collapse of the dot-com and
large-growth bubble of
2000. I think the rubber
band expanded too far and
finally snapped. Low-price
companies were able to
increase their value more
through share repurchase
while high-price companies
started to make acquisitions
of more traditional
businesses–like the AOL/
Time Warner merger. In
the midst of it, nobody
knew why it was happening,
but that 10x multiple
premium that investors
were willing to pay for
growth relative to cheap
started to collapse all of a
sudden.
We think this environment
is very similar to that late
1990s, early 2000
environment. 

&gt; I'm writing my quarterly letter right now and going
back to comments I made
20 years ago about how
small companies with large
valuations were taking over
the large-cap universe. I
wrote back then that
investors who thought they
were getting a low risk
portfolio because it was
large cap were actually
deluding themselves
because they were taking on
a magnified risk with smaller
businesses that had bigger
ranges of fundamental
outcomes on top of the risk
of very high valuations.
This analogy is important
today as we see big
businesses that were
previously large cap, like
Schlumberger, Phillips 66 or
Dollar Tree, falling out of
the large-cap universe and
being replaced by smaller
companies with very high
valuations. I think that
creates a dangerous
situation for the large-cap
investor who thinks they
have a relatively low risk

Sports-blogger turned day-trader Dave Portnoy’s pithy observation this summer was designed to both amuse and provoke. But if you’ve put money into U.S. stocks since the market bottomed out in 2009, the chances are you think Portnoy is basically correct. Plenty of professional asset managers would concur. 

Perhaps the most important question for those considering investing savings today, when stocks are by some metrics among the most expensive they’ve ever been, is whether Portnoy’s philosophy is about to be turned on its head. In other words: “what if stocks don’t always go up?”

There are reasons to think this fantastic period for the U.S. stock market might soon be followed by a prolonged hangover, possibly lasting a decade or more. Such a stretch of disappointing equity returns would have profound implications for millennials and generation Z. The standard advice around financial planning and retirement saving that’s worked so well lately — put your money in an index fund that tracks the market and forget about it — might no longer work so well.

In the past decade, investors who bought an index fund that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 Index and reinvested dividends have enjoyed a 13% average annual return, according to Bloomberg data.

Even a deadly global pandemic that’s triggered a deep recession and widespread unemployment only briefly interrupted the ascendancy of U.S. stocks. The Federal Reserve rode to the rescue once more, and the S&amp;P 500 hit fresh record highs (though lately investors have since grown cautious again).
Young investors may conclude that bumper returns are all but guaranteed in the years ahead. If only steadily rising stock prices were always the case.
Consider the FTSE 100, an index of some of Britain’s preeminent pharmaceutical, energy, mining and consumer goods companies. In price terms (ignoring the impact of reinvesting dividends for a second), the U.K. benchmark is lower now than it was two decades ago. It’s not alone.

The Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark also remains beneath its dot-com-era peak while the MSCI emerging markets index topped out in 2007 and has yet to recover. The market that really refutes Portnoy’s assertion though is Japan: The Nikkei 225 index remains about 40% below its 1989 peak, when a massive financial bubble burst.

""Stocks Only Go Up""?

Following a financial bubble Japanese investors suffered years of poor returns

Could the U.S. market face a similar fate? There’ve been bleak periods before, most famously in the two decades that followed the 1929 Wall Street crash.

Long Hangover

U.S. stocks took a long time to recover from the 1929 Wall Street crash

As recently as 2012 the S&amp;P 500 was below its 2000 peak. Value-orientated asset managers like GMO’s Jeremy Grantham think something similar could happen again, but it’s not just well-known Cassandras who worry. Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates and Blackstone’s vice chairman Tony James have both warned about a “lost decade” for equity investors. 

If you’d followed GMO’s advice in 2013 to steer clear of American large-cap stocks and load up on emerging market shares, you’d have missed out on seven years of stellar returns. So what’s different now?
1. Extreme valuations
Equity valuations have grown even more extreme. During the pandemic, they have become completely divorced from economic fundamentals thanks to the Federal Reserve’s largess. A stock market bubble pulls forward expected returns from the future, setting investors up for probable disappointment later on. “It’s exactly when past returns are most glorious that future prospects are most dismal,” investor John Hussman, another famously bearish investment manager wrote recently. He’s described today’s menu of choices for passive, long-term investors as “the worst in history.”

Expensive Stocks

U.S stock valuations aren't at dotcom era levels, but they're certainly not cheap

The CAPE ratio uses a ten-year average of inflation-adjusted earnings to smooth out short-term noise

2. Ultra-low interest rates
Low interest rates are often portrayed as bullish for stocks because they boost the value of future corporate cash flows in today’s money and reduce the cost of servicing debt. But with U.S. short-term rates now at zero, the Federal Reserve may find it harder to juice the stock market. Ultra-low rates also reflect pessimism about future economic prospects. “When real rates are low, future returns on equities and bonds tend to be lower rather than higher,” Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton wrote in Credit Suisse’s 2020 compendium of past market returns. “Investors should assume a sober view of the likely excess returns equities can generate from here.”
3. Profit margin reversion
A key determinant of equity returns, profit margins have been unusually high over the past couple of decades. But corporate profits have now suffered a massive hit due to the pandemic. Even without the virus, those oversize earnings should eventually dwindle as competitors spy an opportunity. Monopoly power may hinder this, but dominant tech companies are starting to face more competition and stricter antitrust enforcement. Globalization is also in retreat and workers are demanding are a fairer split of the rewards of capitalism.
4. An aging population
This is often considered a key reason for Japan’s prolonged stock market slump. Although the U.S. is aging less rapidly, the demographic changes underway are bound to have an impact on future equity returns. An aging population may be less productive, lowering potential economic growth. Furthermore, by 2030 the large and asset-rich U.S. baby boomer generation will all be over the age of 65, and they may need to cut their exposure to risky stocks or sell financial assets to fund their retirement, weighing on prices.

While this all sounds bleak, it’s some comfort that over the very long term stocks have tended to go up. In nominal terms, one dollar invested in the U.S. market in 1900 was worth $58,000 by 2019, according to the Credit Suisse market returns study, or an annualized 6.5% return when adjusted for inflation. In the meantime, there are a few things young investors can do to avoid being caught out by a duff decade for U.S. stocks.
For starters, if returns are lower I’m afraid you’ll also need to save more to build wealth. Consider adding some exposure to non-U.S. equities, which may at last be due a period of outperformance relative to the U.S. And by reinvesting dividends you can still obtain decent returns even if stock prices go nowhere. (The FTSE 100 has fallen 19% since the turn of the millennium, but investors who reinvested dividends received a 63% return in that period.)
Hopefully, the gloomy scenario I’ve painted won’t materialize and U.S. companies will develop new technologies that power the economy and the stock market to new heights in the next decade. But if that doesn’t happen, you’ll be prepared.

Call it investors selling or some manipulations downward to get in cheap, but in any event, you were at the party...and you partook. So now you own that stock at a highly-discounted price.

As the weeks go by, you notice that stock price is kinda stuck. Most likely, it goes lower....and lower. Fast forward 3 months and the conference call isn't bad! Revenues are good. So are profits. You know the insiders are making out quite well. 

But...

The stock price goes lower.

Okay....you figure...this is just Big Money trying to shake out weak hands. The fearful sell at hefty losses. But maybe you buy more! Now you're getting stock at a major discount. You're happy...you're a long-termer. You'll wait for the tide to turn.

A year goes by, and this company is doing quite well actually. You read the reports, you can see that money is flowing. But the fucking stock price keeps getting hammered. You start to wonder, is it me? Is this stock waiting for ME to sell and get out before it changes direction? You know in the depths of your mind that if you sell at these losses, the next morning, you're going to wake up to see this stock open at 20% above yesterday's close. So you hold on. 

Another year goes by, and again....there is really NO reason for this stock now to be under $5. Was $25 when you got in. And you now feel in your gut that this is bullshit. You know that this stock is headed for under $1. But you hold on. Planning to buy more when they drop it. 

And then after that, those motherfuckers send you the dreaded proxy vote! Yes....they plan to effect a reverse split. You throw your hands up in the air and start cursing. You might call an attorney to weigh your choices. But you can't help but feel that this is just not fair. If the company stock is falling, the insiders should go down with the ship too!

After all, even if a stock is criminally undervalued, if it does not have something in its future that will cause other people to wake up to its value, it could stay undervalued forever. Today I’m going to talk about a company that has a very clear catalyst which the value, as well as price of the stock, hinges upon. If the catalyst is positive, the upside is enormous, with the stock possibly doubling or tripling almost overnight.

It all started about 6 months ago when I decided to analyse automation. The coming 4th Industrial Revolution will see human-performed tasks being done by robots, and companies that provide these automation services could do very well indeed. After a quick screen, Hollysys Automation Technologies immediately jumped out at me: the company presented itself with spectacular financials characterized by high liquidity; low debt; steadily growing FCF/revenue/net income over the decade; consistent book value; an average ROE of 15% over a decade, ROCE 13%, a stock price trading at a 30-50% discount compared to competitors, and DCF models estimating a value of $30-40 (currently trading about $11). In other words, the dream of any value investor.

I will be the first to admit I don’t have as much knowledge in the automation industry as I’d like – and that’s something I’ve been working on over the past few months. So, after a quick look at their impressive financial statements, our next step was to talk to the IR of the various Hollysys competitors to better understand the competitive environment that Hollysys were operating in, and whether they could preserve their impressive return ratios over the long term.

As a quick overview of the company, Hollysys operates in two segments: industrial automation and railway automation. In industrial, most of the company’s revenue comes from automating fossil fuel energy plants. It would not be unfair to compare it to a defence company or a public contractor, since the Chinese Communist Party controls the state railways and owns a 75% stake in SINOPEC, China's largest and most important oil company. In addition, the company also has a dominant market position in safety systems for nuclear power plants in China, a sector that is growing with a CAGR of 17%, bringing the number of reactors in the country from 16 in 2012 to 56 in 2020. As the only certified provider of nuclear automation services in the country, HOLI has a monopoly in this subsector.

In the railway sector they hold a 30% market share, and they do not expect further increases in market share. Long-term organic revenue growth is likely to be 5%, primarily coming from after-sale services. However, they are actively researching new products such as CBTC (Communications-based train control) in subways, smart systems on highways, etc. If these products gain traction, which they should, then growth will be higher. Also, the company proved to have a great competitive advantage in the high-speed railway field as they are 1 of the 3 approved providers in 300-350km/h segment and 200-250km/h and the largest company in terms of ATP (on board equipment) sets.

In their ‘Smart factories’ subsegment, they provide solutions to accelerate product development cycles for large white goods companies like Haier. They provide integrated data collection products like SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), data utilisation and analysing services to understand the application situations, designing the system architecture, data management and so on, being the largest company in terms of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. Another example of this subsegment of industrial automation would be their contract with Diaobignshan where they used to collect data to build a factory virtually and rapidly iterated designs to optimise efficiencies at low cost. They provide after-build services such as combustion optimization, equipment monitoring and maintenance, etc. This segment generates real tangible returns for customers, with higher production efficiencies and lower cost. However, it’s worth noting that some of their revenue in this segment comes from fossil fuel companies as well, so a surge in renewable builds could see revenue dropping even more than it would appear at first glance.

All the segments that Hollysys operates in have been growing impressively for the past few years, at a rate above even the high growth of the general Chinese economy. To fuel their supply-side based growth, fossil fuel plants have been opening across China at an unprecedented rate, while China’s high-speed railway network has gone from virtually non-existent 15 years ago to being 2/3rds of the entire world’s track length. As Chinese wages rise, the pressure on factory owners to automate is also increasing to stave off price competition from South-East Asian competitors.

So far, the situation all looks good from a high-level company view. But when you either zoom out to look at the macro environment, or in to look at the specifics of the business, cracks begin showing.

The situation with the Chinese government is tricky – and not for the reason you might think. Despite the fact that most of HOLI’s revenue comes from state-owned entities, and it’s monopolistic market position also dependent on the government, we do not see the government introducing competition to the market to drive down prices as a big threat. China has applied a protect-and-nurture strategy for domestic companies in every sector you could think of very successfully, creating such behemoths as Tencent and Alibaba. You prevent superior foreign competition from entering the market, and choose a winner for each sector, allowing it to take monopolistic profits to accelerate the rate of innovation and shorten the timeline that it needs to compete with foreign companies. From the past decade, Hollysys is the chosen winner for the sectors that it competes in, and that the threat of increased competition due to the Chinese government is virtually non-existent. Companies like Siemens or ABB still have objectively superior products and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Until HOLI catches up with them and can compete in a global free market, the handholding from the government will not end.

However, while the Chinese government will not introduce competition to the markets that HOLI competes in, whether it will continue to incentivise those markets is another question entirely. In a recent Chinese government conference, China firmly stated that it would become carbon neutral by 2060 (pay attention: NET carbon emissions will be equal to 0, and not TOTAL emissions, which is quite different). I have no doubt that this will happen – the largest benefit of a single-party state is that these long-term plans can be set in stone and executed upon decades in advance, something which China has been doing since the ways of Deng. And quite obviously, there is consequently a very real threat to the heavily polluting fossil fuel-based power plants that HOLI derives a lot of its revenue from. Banning the construction of new fossil fuel plants is an obvious way to reach this target, but whether China chooses to do this or to find alternative methods of cutting net emissions is less obvious. I would like to remind you that coal consumption, which fell from 2013 to 2017, driven in part by China's willingness to significantly improve air quality, has started to rise again in more recent years as the economy suffered a severe backlash forcing the government to stimulate industrial growth. 

 Although the government has not released some specifics regarding how these emissions will be reduced, it is thought that this was strongly desired to allow the Communist Party to have the flexibility necessary in the short term to support the economic recovery following the pandemic. Renewables cannot as yet compete with fossil fuels in lifetime cost of operation, and building more fossil plants is a tried-and-true method of giving the economy a shot in the arm, something that any economy could do with right now.

At the same time, future constructions of railways are also uncertain. Most of the tracks laid in recent years is economically unviable, with low demand and a poor populace in these tier-3 cities laying a cap on ticket prices. However, the government views high-speed rail as a socially beneficial alternative to coaches and planes for the hundreds of millions of migrant workers that travel between large cities and the country every holiday, and thus heavily subsidises losses and encouraged more construction in the last 5-year plan. Whether continued construction in both railways and fossil fuel power plants will happen is up in the air and something that we will see in the next 5-year plan, due in March 2021.

A natural response to the threat to fossil fuel power generation automation would be to ask whether Hollysys could simply transition to automating the renewable power generation sector. My research indicates that this is not realistic. The various wind turbines, solar panels, dams, etc. they do not require a complex level of automation like that used in a refinery plan. The latter are huge power plants that occupy hundreds of square meters which require automated processes to obtain the greatest result with the least effort.

While as regards the structures and machines used for renewable energy, they do not require complicate automated processes such as those used in oil and petrochemical plants; the entire process is enclosed within the turbine itself (as far as wind energy is concerned), so that it becomes almost impossible to state that these types of energy require any automation processes. In the image below I have shown you what the inside of a wind turbine looks like, which differs drastically from the previous image of the refinery plant.

^(image from) ^(https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/inside-wind-turbine)

A field of application, which is very different from the one discussed above, could be to offer automation processes for the companies that produce the different solar panels, wind turbines and so on. This, however, has nothing to do with the automation processes used in oil and petrochemical businesses; here we are dealing with real industrial processes which cannot be connected to the former since they are completely different fields.

The problem is that we are not sure if Hollysys can provide such solutions and even if it is able, we do not know the time needed for this transition. One of Hollysys' strengths was its vast knowledge in the oil industry, which allowed it to keep various competitors away, but this advantage will not be reflected in the renewable sector since they have no knowledge in this field and, and from what I’ve seen, the company has not shown any interest in this sector, neither from the various conference calls held in the past nor from the annual or quarterly reports, which suggests management is either unaware of the threat or incapable of addressing it. The fact that management accounts for some fossil fuel plant automation revenue in ‘smart factories’ suggests the latter, and that they’re trying to make it look less serious than it is.

We are not saying that the company is in danger of failure, since it still has two other revenue streams to rely on, but we will certainly see a decrease in revenues (in 2019, 41% of revenues derive from automation sector, of those 41%, 40% are from oil industries) and a deterioration in the relationship with the Chinese government.

Overall, the conclusion can be drawn that if the coming 5-year plan is unfavourable to Hollysys, the company will face serious setbacks to its short and long-term prospects as the market is pricing in, while a positive 5-year plan that encourages construction of both fossil fuel plants and railways would be hugely accretive to the value of the company. My personal stance is to wait and see what the 5-year plan says – with a small-cap Chinese stock like this, the market is unlikely to immediately react and fully reprice Hollysys on positive news, allowing me a chance to get in after the future is secure even if I miss out some gains. The uncertainty regarding the possible downside to a company is something I hate, although if you have more stomach for risk and think the 5-year plan will be friendly to HOLI, you could jump in now.

If you are positive enough to jump in now you may find interesting that in my positive-scenario-model, I therefore attribute to the automation sector a CAGR of about 5% for the next 10 years, the railway sector a CAGR of 5-6% (assuming continued construction in the next 5-year plan) and attribute to the nuclear sector a CAGR of 12-15% given the enormous progress made in this particular sector in the last 10 years. The final stock price would be something between $25-30 but only if Hollysys starts to be valued with the same multiples of its peers and Chinese government postpones its good intentions to reduce their carbon impact on the rest of the world in order to sustain Chinese’s economy recovery.

* About 3 months ago the ex-CEO Baiqing Shao was changed, who has      held the role for more than 7 years and was one of the founders of the      company, with a member of the company's directors, Mr Colin Shang. The      reasons for this decision were not entirely transparent, as the company      initially stated that the CEO had left office and remained on good terms      with the company, but in the latest quarterly report the company states      the following: **""Dispute in connection with the ownership of Ace      Lead Profits Limited ("" Ace Lead "") may adversely impact us.""**      *We were made aware of a shareholder’s dispute regarding ownership of one      of the principal shareholders. In August 2016, Mr. Changli Wang, the then      sole shareholder of Ace Lead, one of our record shareholders, transferred      his single share in Ace Lead to Mr. Baiqing Shao for a nominal      consideration. As of the date hereof, Ace Lead owns 4,144,223 ordinary      shares of our company, representing 6.9% of the outstanding shares of our      company. We were recently notified that Mr. Wang indicated that, as Mr.      Shao had stepped down as the chairman and chief executive officer of our      company since July 2020, he should no longer be entitled to any share in      Ace Lead and he should immediately transfer the share in Ace Lead to one      or more persons designated by Mr. Wang. As of the date of this annual      report, Mr. Shao has not transferred the share in ACE Lead to any      designees of Mr. Wang. We cannot predict the outcome of the dispute. If      Mr. Shao refuses to transfer the share in ACE Lead to a person designated      by Mr. Wang, the dispute could escalate and litigation may ensue between      Mr. Shao and Mr. Wang, and our company may become involved. Any escalation      of this dispute, including potential litigation, may cause us to incur      significant time, resources and cost if we were to become involved.*  
As easily understood this does not seem a ""friendly"" decision by the old CEO, moreover with 7% of the shares in circulation he can do much more damage to the company by attending the shareholders' meetings, being one of the shareholders with the highest participation .
* Many impairments of goodwill. The M&amp;E refers to two companies      they bought, Concord and Bond. They are based in Singapore and Malaysia.      But their business spread in south east Asian and middle east. Before      COVID-19, the macro-economy situation in those areas was not good, and      then COVID-19 brought new challenges. Therefore, their management expects      future lower profit in M&amp;E. They also do not give guidance on the      development of M&amp;E since the company think risk control is the key      focus, rather than revenue growth.
* When they got asked what they thought about Trump will to delist      Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges they said that they are evaluating      recent issues that may potentially affect their status as a Nasdaq-listed      company and it is prudent to say that they do not exclude that option. So,      no real answer was given about that, which makes me think that they do not      have any plan for the near future.
* IR is slow to respond to investors. I sent two emails, the first of      which was generally positive and the second follow-up which raised some of      the issues discussed in this article. IR has not responded to the second      for more than a month, which makes me very uncomfortable.

Also, I wanted to give you a feedback on what Hollysys has to say about this matter but investor relator has not replied to my email for more than 1 month, this gives you a clue on how bad their communication with investors is.

# **Investors are hoping for a clear presidential and Senate election outcome to end the sell-off  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/investors-are-hoping-for-a-clear-presidential-and-senate-election-outcome-to-end-the-sell-off.html)**
*****
&gt; The best hope for markets in the week ahead is that there is a clear cut winner in Tuesday’s presidential election.
*****
&gt; The election looms large as the biggest wild card risk for markets, and there is a real concern that no outcome could lead to a period of uncertainty and turbulence for markets and the economy. On the other hand, some strategists say a clear winner and quick concession by the other candidate could lead to a relief rally. Also a worry is that Senate elections could be unresolved, which means it may not be known which party holds the majority.
*****
&gt; “If there’s no clear winner, it will be negative for risk assets...The market is really worried about not having clarity after the election. They’re worried about it dragging out four weeks as the results are contested,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The overall landscape is not a political one. It’s that we’re in a pandemic, and we don’t want an uncertain election outcome that leaves the country concerned about leadership.”
*****
&gt; Stocks closed out October on a sour note, losing about 6% for the week, the worst performance since March, when the pandemic first shut down the economy. Strategists say the coronavirus is again worrying the market, as major European countries go into partial lockdowns, and the U.S. faces record numbers of new cases.
*****
&gt; Lyngen said he does not expect the markets to react as much if it’s only the fate of the Senate that is undetermined. But that is still very important, and if it’s not clear which party has a majority for days or even weeks, that would cast doubt on the ability of whichever candidate wins the presidency to pursue their policy agenda.
*****
&gt; # Senate key for stimulus
*****
&gt; The Senate is also key to how much money will be poured into the economy to help battle the impact of the virus. For instance, if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, but Democrats do not reclaim the Senate, he will likely have to compromise on a smaller stimulus package and would not be able to implement tax increases. If President Donald Trump is re-elected and faces a newly Democratic Senate alongside the Democratic House, he will likely face push back on many issues though they may agree on a large stimulus package.
*****
&gt; As of Friday, Biden was leading Trump in the polls by 7.8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls. Democrats also appear likely to take the Senate, but some races are very tight.
*****
&gt; Bank of America strategists note that the Senate races are close with a few seats that could flip. Seven Republican seats are currently rated as toss-ups with four in battleground states, where they could be lost if there’s a strong Democratic surge. There could also be a clear majority, but still uncertainty in terms of final makeup.
*****
&gt; “The overall composition of the Senate is unlikely to be determined until sometime in January due to election rules in Georgia which stipulates the race goes to a run off if no candidates garners 50% majority in the general election and currently no candidate is projected” to hit that threshold, the BofA strategists wrote.
*****
&gt; The strategists say the timing of the results is unclear due to early voting but high volumes of mail-in ballots, which cannot be counted in some states until election day.
*****
&gt; “A short delay in the election result should have a trivial impact on the economy but a multi-week contested election could drag down H1 GDP growth by 0.5-1.0 pp,” according to BofA strategists. “Once there is a winner, the focus turns to stimulus.”
*****
&gt; # Watch bond yields
*****
&gt; That could mean bond yields will continue their move higher in the coming week. Yields have been rising on the idea that there will be some kind of stimulus after the election, and it will mean more U.S. debt and higher interest rates.
*****
&gt; “We expect rates to shift higher by 5 to 25 bps after the election outcome is known due to expectations for fiscal stimulus and improved growth prospects,” the BofA strategists wrote. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 0.86% Friday.
*****
&gt; However, if the election outcome is not known for awhile, the strategists said a contested outcome could push the 10-year yield materially lower.
*****
&gt; If there is a contested election, the strategist expect stocks to trade lower, but it would be a buying opportunity since the market typically recovers from headline-related losses within six months.
*****
&gt; “We expect a clear outcome to be neutral to positive for the market in the near term, except under a Biden win with a split Congress, which could potentially lead to continued gridlock in fiscal stimulus talks,” the BofA strategists added.
*****
&gt; Besides the election, there is also a Fed meeting, expected to end Thursday with no new announcements though it is likely the Fed will emphasize it will keep policy easy for a long time as the economy heals. The October employment report is expected on Friday and is expected to show continued job gains, after September’s 661,000 nonfarm payrolls.
*****
&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, does not expect the market to react much if the election outcome is as expected, with Biden winning and Democrats taking the Senate.
*****
&gt; “The most likely outcome is already discounted by the market. The best assumption is if you don’t have a big surprise, the market should do nothing,” Golub said, adding the most volatile week could be the one just ending. “This week is the one with the turmoil, and I don’t think the next week is the one where the market’s going to be crazy.”
*****
&gt; Golub said investors may be too worried about the election being unresolved and the real issue disturbing the market this past week is the growing spread of the virus.
*****
&gt; “There’s no rule we need to declare a victor,” said Golub. “We have four or five weeks. The market may not love that near-term indecision, but the system is set up to allow for it, and as long as things don’t go off the rails, and they really shouldn’t, this concern about a contested election is probably overblown as an investor issue.”
*****
&gt; Golub said there’s a greater chance that the winner of the presidency is known before the Senate. “The chances are that we’ll at least know directionally where the power sits, but that could take a little longer and the market may be a little uncomfortable with that,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Earnings reports
*****
&gt; Dozens of companies report earnings in the week ahead, and Golub said corporate profits are a bright spot for the market. The third quarter results so far are showing earnings down about 10%, compared to earlier forecasts of more than 20%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “The reality is the economy is robust. 55% of the market cap of the S&amp;P has higher earnings in 2020 than in 2019. More than half the market is acting like there’s no recession, no downturn,” Golub said.
*****
&gt; Golub said both Trump and Biden would push for fiscal stimulus, but while the market is clear on where Trump stands it does not know that much about Biden, if he were to win. “It is going to take some time to get clarity on which of his policy initiatives are going to happen. I don’t believe he’s going to implement these tax increases he’s talking about right away. I think the economy is too frail,” said Golub.

&gt; # November Almanac: Usually a Top Month in Election Years

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000 (since 1979).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/43b1cac3b88cfc6f79063d86ae9abfef/57e8d7f397fbeeb8-7f/s400x600/a8bff5e250ce7b9735197427f72d665b61fe0614.jpg))**

&gt; November is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 10 of the last 17 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.7%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&amp;P 500 November ranks best with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #7, #3 and #6 respectively. Fewer years of data (12 for NASDAQ and 10 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains when compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500.

*****

&gt; # Whatever the Outcome, Day Before Election Day Historically Bullish

&gt; Looking back at the last seventeen presidential elections since 1952, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.51% and 0.44% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.

&gt; # GDP Bounces Back

&gt; The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns triggered the largest quarter over-quarter decline in gross domestic product (GDP) since WWII, so perhaps it comes as no surprise that the following quarter tallied the sharpest rebound in that same time period. GDP expanded 33.1% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, ahead of Bloomberg consensus expectations of 32%, fueled by the continued reopening of businesses and reversing much of the economic fallout stemming from COVID-19-related lockdowns.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, consumer spending—the largest contributor to GDP in the US and roughly 70% of economic output—rebounded in a powerful fashion in the third quarter.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.29.20-Blog-Chart.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; However, spending numbers were uneven, with a considerably larger portion spent on goods rather than services—consistent with the continued behavioral and business restriction effects on these industries. Further, the timing of spending was also fairly uneven, as much of the growth in consumer spending came in the early weeks of the third quarter and tapered off in recent weeks where the effects of fiscal stimulus and rising new COVID-19 cases influenced consumer behavior.

&gt; “GDP rebounded stronger than expected in the third quarter, but the big question on everyone’s mind is whether the economy can remain on firm ground in the fourth quarter and into 2021,” stated LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Barring a new round of fiscal stimulus, it’s likely that growth will taper off in the fourth quarter, but we still don’t expect a double-dip recession.”

&gt; Regardless of the state of economic momentum, it is remarkable that GDP is already only about 3.5% away from recovering the entire pandemic losses. The resilience of US consumers has been the top story of the recovery, even with the historic fiscal stimulus.

&gt; The surge in growth in the third quarter may also have political implications. As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Are the Polls Wrong Again? the average GDP growth in the second and third quarters of election years can have predictive power for who wins the election, with stronger growth favoring incumbents. However, we also point out that recessions close to elections have favored challengers, sending some conflicting market signals heading into Election Day!

&gt; As the economy moves forward in the fourth quarter, we’ll continue to monitor real-time data indicators to gauge the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on consumer and business behavior.

&gt; # Slight Dip In Consumer Confidence

&gt; Consumer Confidence for the month of October was released earlier today and showed a slight dip relative to September. The headline index dropped from 101.3 down to 100.9 compared to expectations for a reading of 102.0. Given the rising number of cases and the upcoming election, it's not too surprising to see confidence come in a bit, so a decline of this magnitude isn't all that concerning. What is notable, though, is that even though Consumer Confidence remains right near post-COVID highs, it hasn't bounced all that much off its lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC.png))**

&gt; Breaking out this month's report by the sentiment of consumers towards both how they feel now and what they expect in the future, the Present Situation Index rose from 98.9 up to 104.6 while the Expectations component dropped from 102.9 down to 98.4. The drop in the Expectations component of this month's report looks like it's a partial reflection of growing uncertainty regarding COVID and the election as we head into the colder months of November and December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-P-Exp.png))**

&gt; In looking at the spread between Present Conditions and Expectations, it moved back into positive territory this month after dropping deeply into negative territory earlier this year. What's interesting to note about current levels is that in every prior recession since the late 1960s, by the time the spread moved back into positive territory after turning negative, the recession was already well in the rearview mirror.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Spread.png))**

&gt; Sentiment towards jobs also suggests a relatively positive trend. At the current level of 26.5, the Jobs Plentiful index is still far from its 40+ reading before COVID, but it did increase again in October as it has now done in four of the last five months. While it's by no means a strong reading at current levels, it hasn't been getting worse either. Looking at past recessions, it wasn't until well after the recession ended that the Jobs Plentiful index started to rebound.

&gt; # Industrials Malfunction

&gt; With poorly received earnings reports from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) and general weakness overall, Tuesday was just a bad day for the Industrials sector. Just five stocks in the sector were up on the day and the sector overall was down 2.2% compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was down just 0.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Perfoamnces.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and the Industrials sector over the last year. Positive readings indicate the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector and negative readings indicate that the Industrials sector outperformed the S&amp;P 500. With the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector by 1.88 percentage points on Tuesday, it was the widest performance gap (in the S&amp;P 500's favor) since 9/21. Even more notable, though, was the fact that there have only been three other days in the last year where the Industrials sector underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wider margin.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Spread.png))**

&gt; For the sector as a whole, it currently finds itself in a precarious position. After breaking its uptrend off the March lows on 9/21, the Industrials sector bounced back and rallied back to its former uptrend line, and while it just recently made a post-COVID high, the rally ran out of steam right at the former uptrend line. In the pullback that has followed, the sector closed yesterday right at a secondary line of support from the June lows. If this level doesn't hold through today's close, the technical picture for the sector will look a lot different than the way it looked just a few weeks ago.

&gt; # All or Nothing Days Back on the Rise

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's A/D line for the day (number of advancing stocks minus number of declining stocks) currently stands at about -460, which would be the weakest one-day reading since June. Today's A/D reading also is notable in that it represents the tenth 'all or nothing' day for the S&amp;P 500 since the index's last peak on 9/2. We consider 'all or nothing' days to be those days where the S&amp;P 500's daily A/D reading is either above +400 or below -400. To put the frequency of 'all or nothing' days into perspective, while there have been ten in the last forty trading days, in the forty trading days before that there weren't any.

&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of 'all or nothing' days on a 50-day rolling basis. The current pace of 20% is still well off the extraordinary level of 44% we saw back in late April/early May, but it is still relatively high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-50.png))**

&gt; Including today, there have now been 41 'all or nothing' days so far in 2020. If the current pace for the entire year keeps up that will put us on pace for fifty days this year. If the current pace keeps up and we do reach 50 'all or nothing' days this year, it will be the third-highest annual total behind 2011 (70) and 2008 (52), but even if there isn't another 'all or nothing' day this year, 2020 would still rank fifth behind the years from 2008 through 2011.

&gt; # Earnings and Economics Diverge

&gt; This earnings season, we have frequently mentioned how beat rates have continued to rise relentlessly. From our Earnings Explorer database, our 3-month rolling EPS beat rate currently stands at a record high of 78.19%. That is nearly 20 percentage points higher than the historical average of 59.37%. The sales beat rate is not at a record, but it too is elevated at 69.09% versus the historical average of 56.45%. That means that of the companies that have reported earnings over the past three months, a massive proportion are exceeding consensus sales and EPS estimates.

&gt; While earnings beat rates have continued to grind higher, economic data is another story. The Citi Economic Surprise Index basically tracks macroeconomic data and how it comes in relative to forecasts. Higher readings indicate the data is trending stronger than expected and vice versa for negative readings. With the unprecedented shock to macroeconomic data in 2020, this index for the United States plummeted, but that was followed by a sharp rebound to record highs. Although the index for the US remains higher than anything prior to the pandemic, it has been heading lower since the summer. In other words, economic data is still coming in better than expected but is not massively exceeding expectations to the degree it was back in the spring and early summer.

&gt; The two charts below compare EPS and revenue beat rates to the Citi Economic Surprise Index. Comparing the two series to the Citi Economic Surprise Index shows that while EPS beat rate has been somewhat connected (correlation: +0.325)) there is very little in the way of correlation between the Surprise Index and the revenue beat rate (+0.084). Given that EPS figures are typically easier to massage than revenues, that was a bit of a surprise. What is notable about the recent decline in the Citi Economic Surprise Index is that in prior periods where it became elevated and then pulled back as it did in (2003, 2009, and 2018), the EPS beat rate typically didn't peak and start to trend lower for another few months.

The stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday’s gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.

Yesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday’s issue of the daily recap. 

Today, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that “fees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans”. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.

Europe is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by “about a third” and daily deaths by “close to 40%” this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Today is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it’ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.

**Highlights**

* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an announcement Friday that it will allow U.S. cruise ships to begin a phased approach to resume sailing in U.S. waters starting this Sunday. “After expiration of CDC’s No Sail Order (NSO) on October 31, 2020, CDC will take a phased approach to resume cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters,” according to the CDC’s newly published “Framework for Conditional Sailing Order for Cruise Ships.” Cruise stocks spiked immediately following the announcement.

The programme which makes it easier for customers to discover and shop for sustainable products, launches with over 40,000 Climate Pledge Friendly products across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK with one or more of 19 sustainability certifications.

By Day One Team


Today, Amazon announced the launch of Climate Pledge Friendly in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK.
The new programme will help make it easy for customers to discover and shop for more sustainable products. Customers will now see the Climate Pledge Friendly badge on more than 40,000 products in Europe to signify that the products have one or more of 19 different sustainability certifications that help preserve the natural world, such as reducing the carbon footprint of shipments to customers.
The Climate Pledge Friendly selection includes beauty, fashion, grocery, household, office, and electronics products for consumers and businesses from brands including Cif ecorefill and Seventh Generation by Unilever, Faith in Nature, HP Inc., Haglöfs, Esprit, Calida, and Kite Clothing.



Climate Pledge Friendly products are clearly shown in shopping results, have additional sustainability information on the product page, and are featured in a dedicated section of our store. The Climate Pledge Friendly selection includes products made and sold by small businesses across Europe.
Amazon has partnered with trusted third-party certifications, and customers will be able to discover products that meet sustainability standards designed to help preserve the natural world. Climate Pledge Friendly includes a wide range of global certifications and Amazon is adding European certifications from EU Ecolabel, Blue Angel, and Nordic Swan. Amazon is working with more certification partners and brands to add to the selection of Climate Pledge Friendly products.
As part of the Climate Pledge Friendly initiative, Amazon is also introducing Compact by Design in Europe, a new externally-validated certification created by Amazon to identify products that, while they may not always look very different, have a more efficient design. With the removal of excess air and water, products require less packaging and become more efficient to ship. At scale, these small differences in product size and weight lead to significant carbon emission reductions.
Cif ecorefill offers a unique Compact by Design-certified cleaning spray refill that helps people reuse their spray bottles at home. Its 10-times concentrated formula delivers the powerful Cif cleaning performance with 75% less plastic and in a 100% recyclable ecorefill, enabling significant energy, material and transport savings.
Similarly, Faith in Nature’s plastic-free shampoo bars provide the ultimate zero-waste alternative to bottled shampoo. Their solid shampoo weighs just a quarter of the total weight in a liquid shampoo, significantly reducing the weight and packaging for each order.
“Climate Pledge Friendly is a simple way for our customers to discover more sustainable products that help preserve the natural world,” said Doug Gurr, Amazon UK Country Manager. “With 18 external certification programmes and our own new Compact by Design certification, we’re incentivising selling partners to create sustainable products that help protect the planet for future generations.”
“It’s fantastic to see Amazon helping to make sustainable shopping easier and more accessible for consumers. Fairtrade is committed to supply chain transparency and environmental protection, and we are therefore delighted to be involved in Amazon’s Climate Pledge Friendly program” said Darío Soto Abril, CEO of Fairtrade International.
“I look forward to seeing it launch in Europe, and hope it encourages even more brands to source more sustainably and certify their products so we can continue to drive positive impact that benefits farmers, workers and our shared environment.”



“It has never been more important to provide information that allows us all to contribute to a sustainable future, and our focus is on highlighting products that meet tough requirements on chemical usage, resource consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity,” said Ragnar Unge, CEO Ecolabelling Sweden, in charge of The Nordic Swan Ecolabel. “Climate Pledge Friendly will help guide consumers in Europe to easily find products with trusted sustainability certifications.”
“In line with our mission to make sustainable living commonplace, we are delighted to partner with Amazon on its Climate Pledge Friendly initiative,” said Seb Munden, General Manager Unilever UK &amp; Ireland, makers of CIF ecorefill, Comfort and Seventh Generation, among other brands available through the programme.
“Amazon’s initiative will drive scale and impact for more sustainable consumption by helping customers easily discover products that are Climate Pledge Friendly and encourage the manufacturers to make their products more sustainable. Unilever is committed to delivering products that provide the best experience for consumers while reducing the impact that our products and our operations have on the environment.”
The Climate Pledge Friendly initiative supports Amazon’s commitment to reach the Paris Agreement ten years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040. The company has already committed to reaching 100% renewable energy by 2025 and ordered more than 1,800 branded electric vehicles from Mercedes-Benz to make deliveries to customers in Europe.
Amazon also launched the Climate Pledge Fund, a $2 billion fund to back visionary companies whose products and services will facilitate the transition to a low carbon economy. Amazon is also working to minimise waste, increase recycling, and provide options for customers to reuse, repair, and recycle products. As part of this effort we are removing a wide range of single-use and oxo-biodegradable plastic products from our websites across Europe and the UK to help prevent plastic waste. Building on these actions, Amazon will now make it easier for customers to access product choices that align with our commitment to a more sustainable future.

Stocks rose today, reversing course after being deep in the red the last two days. Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.

After coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.

Today, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.

In Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.

On the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with [Pfizer Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PFE:US) and [Moderna Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MRNA:US) having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said. 

Some analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, “Markets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021. Those assumptions were always optimistic, though, and what we are seeing now is a reality-based repricing. As such, this drop is both necessary and healthy. Markets should reflect the most likely future path, not the most optimistic, and that is where we are headed.”

Given the week we have had, I realized I should have consulted a few strangers before putting my foot all the way down on the pedal.  I do not intend to make changes or rebalance until January, but I really need some constructive criticism/break down of my holdings.

I hope I am posting in the right sub. If not, I apologize and will take the post down.

**Portfolio holdings and Target Allocation**

VYM - 25% Allocation - Dividend play, yield is expected to be 3.25%. Heavy concentration in US specifically in Financial, Consumer Defense, and Healthcare sectors.

MGK - 24% Allocation - Growth play, top 8 holdings are the biggest names in the market now. 38% Technology and 20% Consumer Cyclical.

CLOU - 15% Allocation - Growth play, concentration in cloud computing. I expect cloud computing to continue to become essential to every business over the next 3-5 years.

QCLN - 10% Allocation - Clean energy play, clean energy will continue to become important. Especially if Biden wins election.

VWO - 10% Allocation - International exposure play, looking to take advantage of large cap international companies in emerging market.

VIG - 9% Allocation - Dividend play, contains top US companies that pay dividends.

VT - 5% Allocation - Diversification play, largest holdings are top US and International companies.

CASH - 3% Allocation - Did not purchase fractional shares. This represents actual cash Allocation as of 10.23.2020

**Reasoning and Methodology**

Intending on capturing large upside potential in the Technology sector diversifying with US large cap, cloud computing, and clean energy holdings. I am weighting 30% to technology while taking a diversified approach to the remaining sectors. I anticipate the Technology sector to continue its growth regardless of who wins the presidential election. I intentionally have little weight in Real Estate, Energy, and Basic Material sectors. If Biden wins the 2020 election, I anticipate increased regulations on energy, materials, and financials. If Trump wins the election, I anticipate continued decrease regulation on energy and financial sector.

This portfolio is heavily concentrated domestically with 82% of the holdings being US. 15% international holdings with 10% of the holdings concentrated in Asia including 7.7% concentrated in Asia Emerging markets. 73% of the holdings are an equally balance of large cap holdings since large cap has the best chance of weathering any storm Covid-19 or the election may bring. Beta is 1.56, R squared 93.98%, Sharpe Ratio .88, and Standard Deviation of 31.61%.

**The questions I have**

First things first, what positives and negatives do you notice? I have ALOT of overlapping holdings between these funds. I have no idea what my top weighted company actually is (I anticipate Microsoft, but do not know for sure). Is there a place I can input these tickers and it generate my percentage of holdings? Do my holdings actually make sense? VT and VYM are essentially the same play. While they have a lot of the same holdings, I like how the holdings are weighted differently.

However with yahoo finance.  It says that it closed On October 28th (yesterday) at 326.70.  Well that is different that what fidelity says.  And then just below that number it says, previous close of 338.22?  What gives.  Does the 338.22 refer to October 27th?  If so, that makes sense.

Yesterday was one of the biggest single day selloffs of the year. In a normal year it would've likely been the worst but 2020 is far from normal on any front.

Futures are green at writing but are trending down. We may experience a dead cat bounce before the sell-off continues.

The **VIX** is high. I'm watching for the selloff to continue through the election

### Watchlist:

**UUU** is a low float, key level at $4

**ZDGE** is a low float, watching for a setup above $3.50

Turned 21 this year. Getting to the point - I might be totally wrong and a big IDIOT but how is candlestick an accurate representation of stocks? I get the feeling of OHLC with the big bar filled with either red or green and highs and lows with a very thin line while the between is big and fat while it ONLY represents the opening and closing of the price. YET GIVEN A BIG FAT RECTANGULAR SHAPE MAKING US THINK THE PRICE WAS IN THAT RANGE MAINLY AND THIN LINE MAKES US THINK IT WAS THERE FOR MAYBE A COUPLE OF SECONDS.
Please if you did not understand what I just wrote, let me explain once again. Candlestick could be totally down for 4.5 mins and suddenly rise and it would very inaccurately show the candlestick as being green when it was very much in the red for 90% of the time duration. People say when there's no wick at the top it means huge buying pressure while it could totally be up at the very last moment and would be misinterpreted.
NOW, can someone tell me if there's a candlestick which shows 
— A TIME Based Candlestick which represents the duration of time the stock price was at a certain level. For eg. A price band from 105 to 96 with the stock price being at 96 for 2 minutes, 97 for a single minute, every penny counted for the seconds the price was in the price frame with 0.05 difference accounted for. 100 for 30 seconds and again 96 for another minute and suddenly 105 for a minute. 
If there's a tool that depicts this scenario, it would be very helpful. 
Which shows how much time a stock price was in a certain price range for how long.

Sorry, cannot cut and paste the chart ;

""Monday last week was the anniversary of “Black Monday” in the US, a day in 1987 when the Dow Jones managed to mislay over 25% of its value in a single session. We even wrote an article about it, deciding not to publish as it read like panic clickbait. Some analysts had pointed out the markets were in a similar position, ready for a sharp drop. Needless to say, markets WERE NOT in such a state but following reversals this week, we’re substantially less confident calamity isn’t far away.

When we reviewed matters prior to the 23rd anniversary of “Black Monday”, the DOW was trading around 28,700 points and we calculated in US index needed reverse below 26,500 before we’d risk concerns for the future. Alas, on Wednesday 28th, the DOW managed to bottom at 26,497 points and so far, we’re not seeing great evidence of a recoil in horror from the horrid reversal potential which just triggered (by only 3 points, it must be said).

The immediate situation is quite dangerous, weakness now below 26,497 risking entering a cycle to an initial 24,300 points. While this sounds dramatic, our secondary and hopeful bottom calculation comes in at 20,700 points. The secondary “bottom” number has a pretty unpleasant implication, taking the index into a zone where a hopefully ultimate wipe-out allows for an eventual 17,270 points. As the visuals confirm, this would entirely undo all the Dow Jones gains during the current Trump presidency! It’s perhaps not the ideal image to portray during a US Presidential shambles.

 

If this has all been a dreadful aberration, due to Covid-19 fears once again making themselves known worldwide, early signals of this being an over-reaction shall come if the US index manages exceed 26,830 points as this calculates with the potential of a fairly tame sounding 27,035 points. Achieving a rebound at this level will be the first tickbox hinting bottom is “in”. If bettered, our secondary calculation works out at 27,250 points and allows a deep breath. Above such a point, we shall tend relax and run the numbers again.

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as market participants nervously eyed rising coronavirus case counts in the US and Europe, the presidential election a mere 6 days away, and developments out of Washington regarding stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) slid 3.90$ down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 3.41%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 3.35%.

In the United States, there were 73,240 coronavirus cases reported yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University. Alarmingly, the average number of daily new cases in the US rose  21% compared to the previous week. According to an article from CNN Health, the surge is hitting all parts of the country, with 40 states reporting at least a 10% increase in daily average cases, compared to last week. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said, “Cases are rising quickly. If we go back about six, seven weeks ago to Labor Day, we \[the United States\] were at about 35,000 cases a day.”  U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have risen by at least 10% over the past week across 32 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One good thing is the FDA approval of remdesivir, a therapeutic developed by Gildead (GILD) that was used to treat the president.

In Europe, the average number of daily cases rose by 33% compared to last week, accounting for the greatest proportion of new cases in the world, according to data compiled from worldometer.info. France is the hardest hit country in Europe. On Tuesday, it reported more than 33,400 new cases and 523 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, as well as a net increase of 74 admissions to intensive care, bringing the total  to 2,918, over half the country's overall capacity of 5,800. French President Emmanuel Macron announced nationwide restrictions for the next four weeks. Germany joined France, imposing its own four-week nationwide lockwide, which includes curfew and restrictions on businesses like gyms, bars, restaurants, hairdressers etc.

Yesterday, President Trump publicly acknowledged that an agreement on additional stimulus would not happen until after the election. While he signaled that his administration was still willing to negotiate, with the election a mere 6 days away, the chances of stimulus passing before then are practically zero.

Members of Blair management, together with the broker groups (“*The Groups*“), **took steps to increase the prices of Blair stocks in the early aftermarket (after-market meaning post IPO) for those stocks.**

Before the deals went effective, there were trading agreements (“*The Agreements*“) between members of management, including Alan Stahler (“*Group Leader*“), and the leader or leaders of the broker group for that particular deal (“*Other Group Leaders*“).

Pursuant to the agreements, members of management arranged for their customers to **sell, at prearranged prices, newly issued securities,** which were thereafter retailed to customers of other Blair brokers (“*The Brokers*“), specifically **members of the broker group** for that deal, at **higher prices**.

*After the company completes the IPO, the Broker Groups buy and sell to each other at higher prices. This is also known as a* [***“daisy chain”***](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daisychain.asp#:~:targetText=Daisy%20chain%20is%20a%20financial,are%20chasing%20an%20upward%20trend.) *, and it happens more often than you might expect. Market manipulation schemes such as this are more likely to occur in the micro cap sector (stocks under $5.00) because it is easier to manipulate the price of these companies due to their lower trading volumes and PPS*

In addition to the activity in the early aftermarket, a primary purpose of the broker groups was to **support the price of the securities during periods of illiquidity.** Brokers in the groups were encouraged to be net buyers, for their customers, of the stocks they had agreed to support, and were actively discouraged from being net sellers of those stocks. For example, the brokers were frequently encouraged to **“cross” trades** — in other words, to place “sell” orders only if they had corresponding “buy” orders **(Buy and Sell To Each Other).** From time to time the broker groups **caused the price of the illiquid stocks to move to artificial levels,** **planned in advance** by engaging in programs of **coordinated buying or selling** on behalf of their customers.

Alan Stahler knew it was very unlikely that the brokers who were soliciting their customers to trade the Blair securities would disclose such techniques for manipulating the prices of those securities **(Broker Did Not Tell Customers About The Agreement).**

Blair gave its brokers incentives, in the form of **higher-than-normal compensation**, known as “specials,” to **help foster demand for and support the price of these securities.**

**Below is a hypothetical example of how this would work. First, the traders buy $1 million worth of stock. They then buy and sell to each other, increasing the price by $10 with each sequence up the chain.**

""By requiring their IPO investors to buy the stock in the aftermarket in return for IPO allocations (tie-in agreements or laddering), the underwriters created artificial excess demand for the IPOs, leading to distorted price levels in the immediate after-market. Since these manipulated prices cannot be sustained in the long run, the manipulated IPOs underperform significantly when fundamental values are finally reflected in prices. We show that these practices can explain a significant portion of the extremely high level of IPO underpricing during the Internet bubble period.""........

""**First, there is an investor affiliated with the underwriter (the ladderer)""**......

This **investor gets information from the underwriter about the future value of the stock**,"".....

....""which can be either high or low. If the affiliated investor learns that the stock value in the future will be high, then the affiliated investor chooses to trade on this information by buying shares.""........

""**If the affiliated investor learns that the stock value in the future will be low, then he may still choose to buy shares in order to manipulate the stock via a laddering arrangement with the underwriter. .........**

""***The second group of investors is momentum investors***. One can also think of them as being arbitrageurs, day-traders, sentiment investors, or information seekers (as in Aggarwal and Wu (2005)). The momentum investors can observe past prices and volume, but they have no access to fundamental information themselves. Instead, they try to infer from prices and volumes whether an affiliated (informed) investor is buying the stock, and whether they should be buying the stock as well, i.e., trading on momentum. Aside from having limited information, they are in all other respects completely rational. ***The third group of investors is a continuum of noise or uninformed traders***. These traders do not update or condition on any information, and they provide liquidity to the market.'

(October 1, 2003) “J.P. Morgan encouraged customers providing aftermarket interest to increase the prices they were willing to pay typically because other customers seeking allocations had provided aftermarket interest at higher prices. For example, a sales representative told a customer that their aftermarket price limit was “sort of out of the game” and there was “interest at much higher levels.” In the Dyax IPO, a sales representative told the syndicate desk in an e-mail, “If the customer gets 50,000 IPO shares, he will buy 50,000 more (up to $16). If need be, I will tell him to increase his aftermarket price sensitivity to a higher number.” [Link](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002221037/https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18385.htm)

(2006) Hedge funds are sometimes forced to buy unprofitable IPO’s under the condition that they will be given opportunities to purchase hotter, more profitable IPO’s in the future according to the International Association of Small Broker Dealers and Advisors..

**That was a long time ago, so maybe things have changed — but probably not.**

""The International Association of Small Broker-Dealers and Advisors,www.iasbda.com submits the following comments on the above referenced proposal to ban short sales for those participating in a secondary offering 5 days before the offering. We believe that the proposal fails to discuss the broader underlying issues behind the problem: potential violations of the locate and tie-in rules.Participation in a secondary offering is voluntary and therefore participants should not have to short to protect themselves. Arguably they should wait until the price drops in secondary trading,that is unless there is a tie- in to future hot issues. **In other words, hedge funds may be required to buy secondaries in order to get allocations in future more profitable IPO trades. If so, logically therefore they want to short to protect against an investment they do not make voluntarily**. When the positions are immediately closed upon distribution its hard to understand another more substantive purpose. The NYSE staff recently stated that prime brokers should not be ignoring the obvious in such transactions.. But there may be another group of more willing investors, the long lost *long term investor(LTI)*. The LTI will make a long term decision to buy at the offering discount and intend to hold the security. He may however want temporary protection and should be allowed to short and purchase if he holds both positions for a 30-60 day period. The PIPES investor is one example but others may include long term devotees of the company.This holding period would allow small issuers to raise capital in a secondary and allow their investors some protection while holding for the long term.Additionally, the Commission should seriously review the possibility that tie-ins are occurring and determine whether that is good for the capital markets.The Commission can also enforce its current rules more efficiently by insisting that the broker who takes the short sale order insure that a locate is made prior to the offering.These violations are occurring because the brokers handling the short sales are ignoring the fact that the same client is simultaneously shorting. The staff of the NYSE recently warned that it will not allow its prime broker members to turn their heads in such circumstances. These violations therefore occur not because of the lack of clarity but rather because of the lack of enforcement of the locate and tie in rules..""

*“The SEC alleges that a former day trader living in California, Steven Fishoff,* ***schemed with two friends and his brother-in-law to pose as legitimate portfolio managers and induce investment bankers to bring them “over the wall” and share confidential information about an upcoming secondary offering***\*. After promising they wouldn’t disclose the nonpublic information to others or trade an issuer’s stock before an offering was announced, they violated the agreements and tipped each other about the upcoming offerings expected to inherently depress the price of the issuer’s stock.\* ***The tippees then shorted the stock before an offering was publicly announced and assured themselves profits on the short sales after the stock price dropped”.***

The key take away seems to be that if you’re an institutional investor, you are **allowed to know about secondary offerings before everybody else**.

A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.

Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.

In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.

In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.

The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.

The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.

In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

I was gifted some stock in RR as a birthday (litterally) gift from a family member. I've been sitting on these shares for 20 odd years as they have accrued in value, and now the company has agreed to a rights issue.

I figure I have several options here, but feel fairly out of my depth in terms of actually making a decision, and would like to ask the good folks at /r/stockmarket for advice.

Would it be more intelligent to:

A) Buy the additional shares that are offered to me. The stock has been dependable, I can afford what has been offered, and I'm fairly confident that in the long term this move will likely pay off.

B) Sell all my existing shares now. The pandemic may hurt the value of aeronautical companies in the long term, now might be a good time to liquidate these stocks.

C) Sell my shares before the right issue, with the intention of purchasing **more** if RR stock drops. This is a 'risky' move but could potentially pay off. As I said in A, RR stock will likely be a solid investment in the long term, but in the short term with Covid continuing to hurt their profits, RR stock may drop to a point that I can acquire more overall stock by selling now, and buying on a downturn.

D) Just take the cashless take up. Zero risk, moderate reward. I feel like this is a weakest option, but what the hell do I know?

(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (MA.N) reported a 28% slump in quarterly profit on Wednesday as fewer people used its cards to shop, travel and pay bills during the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting transaction volumes for the payment processor.

Mastercard reported a 36% drop in cross-border volume on a local currency basis in the quarter. Gross dollar volume, the dollar value of transactions processed, rose 1% to $1.6 trillion. 

Net income fell to $1.5 billion, or $1.51 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.1 billion, or $2.07 per share, a year earlier.

#  Visa

The company is, without a doubt,  one of the most powerful and well-known financial institution in the world, the word ""visa"" become a nickname for a credit card which is obviously one of the known signs of a strong brand.

Despite a 17% decline due to COVID-19, there was $1.6 billion in capital returns to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

Visa is a must-have asset in any portfolio thanks to its size (assets, capital employees) and of course due to the fact that the world becomes more and more digital and dramatically lowers the use of cash by creating and monitoring cash use restrictions. 

The report will be published after the US market closes its trading session.

**Revenue in 2019:** $9.7 billion

**Q3 Revenue Forecast:** $5 billion

#  Mastercard

Another financial giant will publish its quarterly earnings report during the day.

Mastercard posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings but noted a sharp decline in transaction volumes as consumer spending collapsed during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. “Our platform uniquely positions us to support the shift to digital across consumer and business payments that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in consumers’ preference for contactless payments,” said CEO Ajay Banga.

Everyone in the financial sector and especially the credit companies understand the situation but the question is who will do it in the best and safest way for its customers.

The company will host a conference call today at 9:00 AM ET, 2020, to discuss Q3 20 earnings results.

**Revenue in 2019:** $7.7 billion

**Q3 Revenue Forecast:** $3.96 billion

#  Boeing

Boeing is among the largest global aerospace manufacturers; it is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2018 revenue and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. In 2019, the company recorded $ 76.6  billion in sales and ranked 40th on the Fortune magazine ""Fortune 500"" list, in 2020 the company ranked 121th.

2019 production output list: 

380 commercial aircraft 

229 military aircraft

2 satellites

Apart from the company's great influence on the US GDP, the company has strategic importance to the US government and military and it is impossible to even think of a scenario where the company is in difficulties and the US government does not send some money immediately meaning, the company is considered too big to fall.

**Revenue in 2019:** $76.5 billion

**Q3 Revenue Forecast:** $14.4 billion

#  eBay

Not many know this that on October 3, 2002, PayPal became a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay, only 12 years later, in September 2014, eBay Inc. announced the divestiture of PayPal as an independent company, which was completed in July 2015.

eBay generates revenue by a complex system of fees for services, listing product features, and a final value fee for sales proceeds by sellers.

eBay is also one of those few companies that benefit from COVID when consumers prefer ro buy online instead of going to a physical store (when they can...) and this can be clearly seen in their revenue and profits in recent months.

**Revenue in 2019:** $10.8 billion

**Q3 Revenue Forecast**: $2.69 billion  


# Ford

The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom, and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors.

The headquarters of the company is in Dearborn, Michigan, a Democratic country in six consecutive presidential elections from 1992 through 2012. Donald Trump narrowly flipped the state in 2016, defeating Hillary Clinton by just 0.2%. This was the closest state by popular vote percentage in 2016.

why it's important? 

The company receives a lot of money from the US government so they can pay salaries, in fact, the company did not fire employees in the first six months from the outbreak of the pandemic and paid its employees (who stayed at home) full salaries!

Trump wants to win the election again and he knows that Michigan is a very important state when with 16 electors that can keep him in the white house for another 4 years.

## Market Notes:

Yesterday we saw some strange trading. The Nasdaq closed well in the positive while the S&amp;P 500 and the DOW closed in the red.

Markets appear very choppy at the moment but the trend is still certainly down. The SPY had been trading in a down-trending channel and has fallen through the bottom of that channel in the premarket.

Futures are pointing towards a bloody open. Down more than 1% at writing. 

Risk is high as the election draws closer.

I've only a taken two trades this week. I could be on the sidelines again today. You can't lose what you don't risk.

 Cytocom Strategic Vision Conference Call Reminder 1:28 pm ET October 27, 2020 (PR Newswire) Print Cytocom, Inc., a leading biopharmaceutical company in the area of immune-modulation, today announced that its Chief Executive Officer, Michael K. Handley, will host a conference call on Wednesday, October 28, 2020, at 8:00 a.m. ET, to discuss the proposed merger with Cleveland BioLabs (CBLI) and provide a strategic vision for the combined company. 

 Cytocom, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies targeting autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious diseases and cancers based on a proprietary platform designed to rebalance the body's immune system and restore homeostasis. Cytocom is developing therapies designed to elicit directly within patients a robust and durable response of antigen-specific killer T cells and antibodies, thereby activating essential immune defenses against autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious diseases, and cancers. Specifically, Cytocom has four programs in late-stage clinical development in Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis and pancreatic cancer. Cytocom believes that its technologies can meaningfully leverage the human immune system for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes by eliciting killer T cell response levels not achieved by other published immunotherapy approaches. Cytocom's immunomodulatory technology restores the balance between the cellular (Th1) and the humoral (Th2) immune systems. Immune balance is regulated through T-helper cells that produce cytokines. The Th1 lymphocytes help fight pathogens within cells like cancer and viruses through interferon-gamma and macrophages.

Stocks traded choppily after yesterday’s selloff, with the indices losing an average of 5% from their October highs. Market participants are closely monitoring the rising number of coronavirus cases in the US and Europe and uncertainty surrounding stimulus and the presidential election a mere week away.

In the US, over the weekend, the US registered coronavirus cases hit a record high with more than 81,000 new cases, according to data gathered from worldometers.info. Yesterday, the US registered 70,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert said the US is still in the “first wave” of the pandemic, given that cases never stabilized to more than a “manageable level.” He explained that while the Northeast has been able to reduce its outbreak, the national baseline never fell to a more manageable number like 10,000 cases per day.

With a worrying surge of cases across Europe, governments have begun imposing a new round of restrictions. Today, the Czech Republic joined France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom in enforcing a strict nighttime curfew and placing new restrictions in businesses such as gyms and restaurants. 

Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin met for what feels like the hundredth time to discuss the passage of additional stimulus. Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hamill said of the meeting, “The Speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,” adding that “progress depends on Leader Mitch McConnell.” Today, Senators left Washington for a break ahead of the election. With the election a mere week away and Senators no longer in Washington, chances to pass a bill are extremely thin. 

Next Tuesday, November 3rd are the US presidential elections between Joe Biden (D) and President Trump (R). The election is set to be extremely contentious and will have enormous effect on the market for years to come.

* Siyata Mobile has 3 product lines, all in high-growth areas – Push-to-Talk-over-Cellular and Cellular boosters.
* Since its IPO in Canada in 2014 Siyata has been a company in development. while it had low-end sales, mostly in Israel, Siyata was working on FirstNet-Apporoval, product-development and carrier-type-approvals.
* In 2019-2020 the business started to accelerate in North-America Siyata got type-approvals and entered AT&amp;T and Verizon, in addition to launching a booster-line for first responders.
* A month ago Siyata raised \~12M USD in equity to in order to register on Nasdaq and to fund working-capital, all in preparation for what I expect to be a breakthrough year.
* In my estimates Siyata, with a market cap of \~15 Million USD including the 12 Million USD cash it raised, could trade at  &gt;90 Million USD within 1-2 years, and &gt;250 Million USD within 3-4 years, even assuming a 10X P/E multiple for a growth company.

This is the biggest RPG game of the decade. 8-10 years in making, it is not just slightly better than other games; it redefines the category. This thing is something everyone will be playing for years to come. Think of it as someone giving you a poke 3 weeks before the original Grand Theft Auto was released. This is the first in franchise.

**Huge moat:** Cost of production is in $120 Million to $200 million range which puts it in the same league as Grand theft auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. GTA V has made 6 billion to date. Red Dead Redemption 2 made over $725 million in revenue in three days, and over 17 million copies shipped in total in two weeks. They have a staff of 500 working on this. It took 8-10 years to make this. No one else is gonna be able to compete for a long time.

**Top dog within class:** There are many different game classes. This is gonna sit at the top of RPG class with anyone thinking about RPG games buying this.

**Buzz:** I don't play video games but even I noticed the buzz. Any trailer, teaser, review that gets posted immediately gets several hundred views within days. [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/) is losing its mind waiting for the release. This post got 134,000 upvotes and is the top post of the week: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jezwed/its\_been\_8\_years\_my\_friends/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jezwed/its_been_8_years_my_friends/)

**Huge nerd following:** Cyberpunk is a genre of fantasy that includes Blade Runner, Matrix trilogy, Terminator, Robocop, ... After dungeon and dragons and magic the gathering, cyberpunk role playing games have huge following. This is your chance to invest in nerds and fringe.

**Wall Street** hasn't woken up to this because the company is Polish. But recently their ADR has been trading OTC without any analyst taking notice. This is your opportunity.

**Uncorrelated** to the rest of the market. When everything else goes down this thing doesn't react. That's a massive advantage giving you uncorrelated gains.

The game has **Drugs, Nudity/Sex, Violence, Politically incorrect concepts, shooting, dystopia, and future technology.** You can even customize your penis in the game. I am not kidding. You really can customize your penis in the game.

**Lots of Celebs:**

* Keanu Reeves - Johnny Silverhand.
* Michael-Leon Wooley - Dexter ""Dex"" DeShawn.
* Grimes - Lizzy Wizzy.
* Samuel Barnett - Delamain A.I.
* Cherami Leigh

Positions: You can only get shares. No options available for North Americans. Also traded in France, and of course Poland.

The employees will help pick, pack and ship customer orders across Amazon’s network of warehouses in the U.S. and Canada.

Amazon said California, Texas, Maryland, Georgia and New Jersey are the top states where it will hire employees.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon has already staffed up its warehouses significantly. The company went on a hiring spree in March and April as it faced a surge of online orders.

## Market Notes:

We're now only one week from the election and uncertainty is everywhere. 

COVID cases are on the rise, new restrictions are being put in place. This will have an impact on business and unemployment.

Trump continues to claim election fraud and battleground states are warning they may not have results back on election night. At this point we aren't sure when will we have election results and if the results will be accepted.

Trade tensions are on the rise with China again. The US approved a sale of arms to Taiwan. Beijing isn't happy.

I've got a short list after yesterday's selloff. The trend is pointing decisively down.

filing: “We are a leading provider of solutions in Earth intelligence and space infrastructure. We help government and commercial customers monitor, understand and navigate the changing planet; deliver global broadband communications infrastructure; and explore and advance the use of space. Our approach combines decades of deep mission understanding and a proven commercial and defense foundation to deliver our services with speed, scale and cost effectiveness.”\n\nMaxar serves multiple customers, from telecom to government defense. Maxar says they serve the government for covert ops and civil planning using geospatial mapping. Maxar also helps in consumer services such as geospatial mapping, weather, forestry, energy, architecture, and they create technologies that aid autonomous driving. \n\nIn terms of satellite contracts, Maxar competes with Lockheed, Boeing, Thales, and Airbus. In terms of services (twice as large of a revenue source as products) their competitors are Booz Allen and L3Harris. This shows you how uniquely situated Maxar is, because of the variety in competitors. This also puts them in a tight spot when it comes to corporate stability and volatility. Around 2018 due to a storm of new leadership, a [failed satellite ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/07/why-maxar-technologies-stock-plummeted-315-today.aspx), and expansion that was a little bit too fast, the stock got absolutely battered. Institutions feared the heavy leverage and the 5x increase in assets over a year:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lmd1slzikv51.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab6c583a1ccef7cc8214c159a9ae0af24c16e4e\n\nAnd after that massive loss in 2018, who would want to invest in such a risky company? Thankfully fear is something that creates the best buying opportunities, and while Maxar fell nearly 90% from its highs, it has managed to recover back to a third of its all time highs due to cutting down on failed projects and deleveraging. Income also turned to previous highs and while returns on assets were damaged by the previous expansion, investing cash flows from those assets actually became positive in the last quarter:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9tp1zoq0jkv51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e68c1f392ea75dedcc1d4d07e037ab88b0444fa7\n\nCash provided by investing activities increased from -127m to 615m, and even though financing cash flows became negative due to the paying down of long-term debt, cash at the end of this period in 2020 remained 3x as high as in 2019. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xcxf3n9jkv51.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3cdc3b0319cdbbcb8664deacde9b43b69223352\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, from 2017 to 2020 Maxar had quite a rollercoaster, in 2017 they took on 2.235B in investing cash flow (debt financing) and then 2018 happened where they couldn’t use this debt to generate a positive NPV project. This led to negative free cash flow in 2018. In 2019 (and as we saw earlier the latest quarter of 2020) you can see Maxar turn free cash flow positive again, signaling a turnaround for this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/54uhkxn1jkv51.png?width=555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4917264ae75b8d09062b41d4d1303b54dabe8abd\n\nMaxar’s diluted EPS (bottom) more than doubled from 2019 to 2020 due to a coming back from a loss for income from continuing operations, and for the six months ended period between 2019 and 2020, EPS went from $1.52 to $4.27, about a 280% increase in EPS. This is why the stock is up from lows of 7-11$ to the 27-30$ range. If Maxar can maintain this trajectory, they can see $90 and higher again in no time. \n\nMaxar is a company that has been around since 1962, so this isn’t some tech bubble startup filled with hopes and dreams consisting of nothingness, it’s quite established. But, their overall growth will have to do much more with its entire industry, which I’ll cover later. First let’s take a look and see if Maxar has really changed or not.\n\nMaxar’s financials have  seen quite a bit of improvement over time:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1cb8smm2jkv51.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c34936466a9de78ea4670a6e19b92b53b17b49bc\n\nReturn on Invested Capital levels are back to pre-crash levels when prices were significantly higher\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/txmpwlpijkv51.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aa46821b33f533f5fc2604845726f870892f5c7\n\nLower cash conversion means less leverage is required and inventory is being cleared much faster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dercr5ujjkv51.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2659db834290ceb5156a524c15e52054341bc555\n\nFree cash flow has significantly increased since 2018, and it may be in its way back to all-time highs once financing cashflow turns positive again or even neutral\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ecojzborjkv51.png?width=391&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37c0270d0859a98deaf9985063e715ad5beefdb3\n\nEBITDA is currently above all time highs, signaling growth for this company pretty much never stopped, just one year was an outlier\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/up9t4gbtjkv51.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00018ddfb463f7bb33cb8ea49ea55fb6fc7b8831\n\nCash is higher than previous highs, signaling better financial stability under new leadership\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6kzso2wjkv51.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=586cd5bb25088e8223d0c9e07d85eaf56af83d11\n\nAssets are much higher relative to debt now, meaning that they’re becoming a safer company to invest in rather than just speculative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwrmm91xjkv51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ede46c8fcad43ddfc32716c38421f4af840d04da\n\n(SimplyWallSt)\n\nMaxar is also trading at about half of its DCF fair value, and it has a Price to Earnings ratio of 6.5, which is significantly lower than the S&amp;P’s current P/E of 31, and even at half that multiple MAXR could grow by another 240% from its current point, which isn’t saying much because it’s a growth stock. That means that Maxar would be a great buy-in even if it doubles in price from now. \n\nNow I’ll discuss the broader economy Maxar competes in:\n\n**The Space Economy**\n\nAccording to a Morgan Stanley analysis from 2017: [“The revenue generated by the global space industry may increase to more than $1 trillion by 2040”](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space).  Usually, these estimates don’t signify much for us considering the vast timeline, and the rather vague and possibly inaccurate preconditions provided to analysts to make these numbers up. It may seem like it’s a number just generated out of thin air, but I think there’s a lot of factors that could lead to the space industry becoming this big in possibly a shorter time span. Considering how cooped up this virus has kept us, it seems like we’re finally getting ready to stretch out and expand human boundaries. With the creation of Space Force, to SpaceX’s first manned flight, to Virgin Galactic's foray into luxury spaceflight, it seems like the only place we can go from here is up (literally)! \n\n[“The Space Foundation (2019), a nonprofit advocacy organization, reported global space activity to be $414.8 billion in 2018, with commercial space revenues representing 79 percent of total space activity”](https://apps.bea.gov/scb/2019/12-december/1219-commercial-space.htm), and seeing that in and of itself should be nothing short of amazing. Before, space ventures had to be sponsored by, funded by, and engineered by the government and taxpayers. Now a private company can lead expeditions for space, and do it while being profitable, which is a big advancement for the economy in general, when private companies and self-reliant citizens can take on the harrowing task of expanding the horizons of mankind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ct7ivkzxjkv51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=737418da70f4d1405be0df35fc1c3df54ce04ee5\n\nThe Morgan Stanley analysis from 2017 believed that the current level of space revenue would be reached in 2023, when in actuality it has thrived beyond their expectations and has continued to grow unperturbed by the pandemic, and it may still continue to increase in liquidity, according to the firm Space Capital, the aerospace industry is fairing rather well during the Coronavirus, probably because it’s not super grounded in consumables but more in broadband, television, and defense. Two of these are industries that have continued to thrive and one is consistent regardless of conditions: [“Investments in space-based companies totaled $5.5 billion in the second quarter, down 23% from the record highs hit in 2019, the report said. The decrease was primarily due to a drop in capital invested in infrastructure companies, like those which build rockets and satellites, but was made up partially by an increase in space-based application companies. Total space investment this year is up to $12.1 billion, a slight increase compared to the same period last year, the report found.” ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/20/space-capital-q2-report-coronavirus-effect-on-space-investment-not-as-slow-as-feared.html)\n\nSo with that being considered, you can almost say that the space industry has proven to be recession proof, and that’s not by necessity but it’s by our strive for innovation. Morgan Stanley also believes that due to the ever expanding need of bandwidth for autonomous driving, the costs to launch satellites into space will dramatically decrease. “While **reusable rockets** will help drive those costs down, so too will the **mass-production of satellites and the maturation of satellite technology.** Currently, the cost to launch a satellite has declined to about $60 million, from $200 million, via reusable rockets, with a potential drop to as low as $5 million. And satellite mass production could decrease that cost from $500 million per satellite to $500,000.”\n\nSpaceX has recently made reusable rockets commonplace. [SpaceX has also reduced the cost to transport 1kg of mass by a factor of 20](https://www.thestreet.com/tech/news/maxar072020), and this has let Maxar hitch rides with them so that they can run their geospatial mapping missions. Companies such as Maxar and others loosely involved in aerospace like Raytheon just needed the means to get out of the stratosphere, and companies like SpaceX have provided that for them. “[SpaceX is hardly the only group making this bet: OneWeb, Telesat and Amazon are also investing billions in networks of thousands of internet connectivity satellites. Apple is also reportedly chasing the dream of space connectivity.](https://qz.com/1774249/2020-is-the-year-of-the-1-trillion-space-economy/)” The purposes for each of these companies vary, from human spaceflight to IOT, which shows the vast diversity of businesses willing to expand into the expanses, and each of the different niches they occupy will have a sustainable spacetech sector soon in order to support further globalization, which ironically, won’t even be on the globe. \n\nMany different industries will explore the possibilities that space offers their business, including defense, energy, mining, communications, and further into the future, communications and real estate. Aerospace and defense will get even more tied in as funding for Nasa is increased and Space Force advances, “that means more money for private companies in space, with half-a-dozen defense agencies already pumping millions into space start-ups building everything from radar networks to high-tech materials”. Lockheed, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and other legacy manufacturers may get revived for innovation that doesn’t require bloodshed but rather innovation that is used for covert operations and reconnaissance, and it may create a more defensive weapons industry rather than the current one, which is more focused on developing offensive technologies.\n\n[NASA is currently working on commercializing low earth orbit, and trying to return to the moon by 2024. ](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/apollo50th/back.html#:~:text=These%20experiences%20and%20partnerships%20will,resupply%20the%20International%20Space%20Station)Such advancements will lead to more companies using the low earth orbit around earth for various goals, and so the satellite technology developed by Maxar will be instrumental to the many companies wishing to do business in low earth orbit. Introducing satellites around other celestial objects is also a major potential for profit for Maxar. NASA is currently also working on lunar orbiters as part of the same project previously mentioned. One of the most expensive objects currently orbiting earth is the international space station. [Its current expiry date is sometime in 2028](https://www.inverse.com/article/15852-nasa-chief-announces-a-2028-expiration-date-for-the-iss-it-is-inevitable). This gives Maxar another huge profit potential further in the future, as Maxar will be instrumental in whatever orbital project replaces the ISS.\n\nInternet communication is currently being taken to space by Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary, which is launching hundreds of satellites into orbit to provide cheap satellite internet. SpaceX is taking advantage of faster speeds in the vacuum of space, along with the larger area that can be reached with communication infrastructure that is orbiting the earth. There are currently 895 starlink satellites, and 120 satellites are being launched every month to reach an end goal of 12000 satellites. A global communications network this large will inevitably require maintenance, which is an opportunity for Maxar to deploy their on-orbit satellite servicing technology, and as more traditional companies realize that they can provide low-latency, high speed internet from low earth orbit, Maxar’s clientele will grow in size.\n\nAnother venture in space is asteroid mining. Although companies in the past have failed in this field due to [lack of funding](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/26/134510/asteroid-mining-bubble-burst-history/), a new [Goldman Sachs report](https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-space-mining-asteroid-platinum-2017-4#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%3A%20space-mining%20for,is%20%27more%20realistic%20than%20perceived%27&amp;text=Those%20economics%20make%20going%20into,be%20more%20realistic%20than%20perceived.) finds that the cost of asteroid mining for precious metals and other substances is continuously getting cheaper. “Caltech has suggested an asteroid-grabbing spacecraft could cost $2.6bn.” While this seems like a large amount, it’s nothing that a dedicated company can’t achieve with the proper funding from several VC funds or an existing billionaire or company willing to invest in the field. Profits margins in such ventures are very high as well, as “a single asteroid the size of a football field could contain $25bn- $50bn worth of platinum.” An opportunity this profitable will not remain untouched for long. The use of satellites for asteroid mapping in this situation provides another potential profit for Maxar, as their geospatial technology is used by energy companies to locate sites to work on. This new form of mining would require massive collaboration between traditional equipment companies such as Caterpillar and aerospace companies like Lockheed, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and Boeing. \n\nFurthermore, mining on other celestial bodies such as the moon can provide a fuel source to be used both on earth, and to power colonies. The European Space Agency, Indian Space Research Organization, and other companies are [interested in mining on the moon](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Space_for_Earth/Energy/Helium-3_mining_on_the_lunar_surface) for helium-3 -a highly efficient source of nuclear power with nearly no waste or radiation- and also for other energy sources. Solar power is also being explored as a potential source of energy on the moon by companies such as Blue Origin. Solar power in space is much more efficient on the moon due to the lack of a filtering atmosphere. This presents a large profit potential for companies with the capital to set up mining stations and fusion reactors. This also presents a profit potential for Maxar, which can provide satellite imagery that’s essential to find helium-3 reserves and optimal locations for solar power. \n\nMining for energy sources on the moon will lead to faster development of colonies on other celestial bodies, as well as orbiting habitats. Commercial space stations alone make a“[new industry \\[that\\] is anticipated to generate $37 billion in the next decade alone](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/industries-will-make-money-in-space/).” Maxar’s on-orbit assembly and servicing technologies will be essential in a project that is aiming to create human habitats that orbit earth. Space colonization is also something that governments and several companies are working on. Permanent settlements allow for better management of mining operations and other projects in space. As a result, it’s likely that colonies will be established on the moon in the near future to manage mining, and later on Mars as part of a larger exploration plan. While Mars colonization might be further in the future, when NASA unveiled their Artemis program, which plans to go back to the moon in 2024, they also unveiled plans to establish outposts on the moon by 2028 (Yes, that’s only 8 years from now). Such an undertaking will require large amounts of planning and exploration far before it’s actually established, and Maxar’s robotics division provides robotics and automation capabilities which are critical to building and maintaining infrastructure for outposts and colonies on the moon. Maxar’s satellite imagery will also be essential for mapping the lunar surface prior to exploration, so a Lunar outpost will definitely be a close collaboration between Maxar and NASA.\n\nMaxar and plenty of other aerospace companies will have tremendous growth opportunities in the future, and the space economy will only continue its expansion under our current STEM-focused environment. At the current rate, of growth (about 8% yearly) the revenues of the space industry will double in just 9 short years, meaning that we’re growing nearly twice as fast as expected.\n\nBTW would y'all be interested if I started writing this stuff on Medium or something? I think it's pretty high quality what do u think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsuggested positions: Maxar shares and apr 2022 leaps, but TBH i think this is something for your retirement portfolio"", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr, it’s the only space-tech company that you can reasonably invest in (looking at you, $SPCE)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maxar’s business as described by their annual 10k filing: “We are a leading provider of solutions in Earth intelligence and space infrastructure. We help government and commercial customers monitor, understand and navigate the changing planet; deliver global broadband communications infrastructure; and explore and advance the use of space. Our approach combines decades of deep mission understanding and a proven commercial and defense foundation to deliver our services with speed, scale and cost effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maxar serves multiple customers, from telecom to government defense. Maxar says they serve the government for covert ops and civil planning using geospatial mapping. Maxar also helps in consumer services such as geospatial mapping, weather, forestry, energy, architecture, and they create technologies that aid autonomous driving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of satellite contracts, Maxar competes with Lockheed, Boeing, Thales, and Airbus. In terms of services (twice as large of a revenue source as products) their competitors are Booz Allen and L3Harris. This shows you how uniquely situated Maxar is, because of the variety in competitors. This also puts them in a tight spot when it comes to corporate stability and volatility. Around 2018 due to a storm of new leadership, a &lt;a href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/07/why-maxar-technologies-stock-plummeted-315-today.aspx""&gt;failed satellite &lt;/a&gt;, and expansion that was a little bit too fast, the stock got absolutely battered. Institutions feared the heavy leverage and the 5x increase in assets over a year:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/2lmd1slzikv51.png?width=678&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aab6c583a1ccef7cc8214c159a9ae0af24c16e4e""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/2lmd1slzikv51.png?width=678&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aab6c583a1ccef7cc8214c159a9ae0af24c16e4e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And after that massive loss in 2018, who would want to invest in such a risky company? Thankfully fear is something that creates the best buying opportunities, and while Maxar fell nearly 90% from its highs, it has managed to recover back to a third of its all time highs due to cutting down on failed projects and deleveraging. Income also turned to previous highs and while returns on assets were damaged by the previous expansion, investing cash flows from those assets actually became positive in the last quarter:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/9tp1zoq0jkv51.png?width=554&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e68c1f392ea75dedcc1d4d07e037ab88b0444fa7""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9tp1zoq0jkv51.png?width=554&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e68c1f392ea75dedcc1d4d07e037ab88b0444fa7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cash provided by investing activities increased from -127m to 615m, and even though financing cash flows became negative due to the paying down of long-term debt, cash at the end of this period in 2020 remained 3x as high as in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/5xcxf3n9jkv51.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d3cdc3b0319cdbbcb8664deacde9b43b69223352""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5xcxf3n9jkv51.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d3cdc3b0319cdbbcb8664deacde9b43b69223352&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, from 2017 to 2020 Maxar had quite a rollercoaster, in 2017 they took on 2.235B in investing cash flow (debt financing) and then 2018 happened where they couldn’t use this debt to generate a positive NPV project. This led to negative free cash flow in 2018. In 2019 (and as we saw earlier the latest quarter of 2020) you can see Maxar turn free cash flow positive again, signaling a turnaround for this company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/54uhkxn1jkv51.png?width=555&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4917264ae75b8d09062b41d4d1303b54dabe8abd""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/54uhkxn1jkv51.png?width=555&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4917264ae75b8d09062b41d4d1303b54dabe8abd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maxar’s diluted EPS (bottom) more than doubled from 2019 to 2020 due to a coming back from a loss for income from continuing operations, and for the six months ended period between 2019 and 2020, EPS went from $1.52 to $4.27, about a 280% increase in EPS. This is why the stock is up from lows of 7-11$ to the 27-30$ range. If Maxar can maintain this trajectory, they can see $90 and higher again in no time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maxar is a company that has been around since 1962, so this isn’t some tech bubble startup filled with hopes and dreams consisting of nothingness, it’s quite established. But, their overall growth will have to do much more with its entire industry, which I’ll cover later. First let’s take a look and see if Maxar has really changed or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maxar’s financials have  seen quite a bit of improvement over time:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/1cb8smm2jkv51.png?width=665&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c34936466a9de78ea4670a6e19b92b53b17b49bc""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/1cb8smm2jkv51.png?width=665&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c34936466a9de78ea4670a6e19b92b53b17b49bc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Return on Invested Capital levels are back to pre-crash levels when prices were significantly higher&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/txmpwlpijkv51.png?width=547&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9aa46821b33f533f5fc2604845726f870892f5c7""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/txmpwlpijkv51.png?width=547&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9aa46821b33f533f5fc2604845726f870892f5c7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lower cash conversion means less leverage is required and inventory is being cleared much faster&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/dercr5ujjkv51.png?width=402&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2659db834290ceb5156a524c15e52054341bc555""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dercr5ujjkv51.png?width=402&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2659db834290ceb5156a524c15e52054341bc555&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Free cash flow has significantly increased since 2018, and it may be in its way back to all-time highs once financing cashflow turns positive again or even neutral&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ecojzborjkv51.png?width=391&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37c0270d0859a98deaf9985063e715ad5beefdb3""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ecojzborjkv51.png?width=391&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37c0270d0859a98deaf9985063e715ad5beefdb3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EBITDA is currently above all time highs, signaling growth for this company pretty much never stopped, just one year was an outlier&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/up9t4gbtjkv51.png?width=497&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=00018ddfb463f7bb33cb8ea49ea55fb6fc7b8831""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/up9t4gbtjkv51.png?width=497&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=00018ddfb463f7bb33cb8ea49ea55fb6fc7b8831&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cash is higher than previous highs, signaling better financial stability under new leadership&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/a6kzso2wjkv51.png?width=498&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=586cd5bb25088e8223d0c9e07d85eaf56af83d11""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/a6kzso2wjkv51.png?width=498&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=586cd5bb25088e8223d0c9e07d85eaf56af83d11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assets are much higher relative to debt now, meaning that they’re becoming a safer company to invest in rather than just speculative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/gwrmm91xjkv51.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ede46c8fcad43ddfc32716c38421f4af840d04da""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/gwrmm91xjkv51.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ede46c8fcad43ddfc32716c38421f4af840d04da&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(SimplyWallSt)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maxar is also trading at about half of its DCF fair value, and it has a Price to Earnings ratio of 6.5, which is significantly lower than the S&amp;amp;P’s current P/E of 31, and even at half that multiple MAXR could grow by another 240% from its current point, which isn’t saying much because it’s a growth stock. That means that Maxar would be a great buy-in even if it doubles in price from now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I’ll discuss the broader economy Maxar competes in:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Space Economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to a Morgan Stanley analysis from 2017: &lt;a href=""https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space""&gt;“The revenue generated by the global space industry may increase to more than $1 trillion by 2040”&lt;/a&gt;.  Usually, these estimates don’t signify much for us considering the vast timeline, and the rather vague and possibly inaccurate preconditions provided to analysts to make these numbers up. It may seem like it’s a number just generated out of thin air, but I think there’s a lot of factors that could lead to the space industry becoming this big in possibly a shorter time span. Considering how cooped up this virus has kept us, it seems like we’re finally getting ready to stretch out and expand human boundaries. With the creation of Space Force, to SpaceX’s first manned flight, to Virgin Galactic&amp;#39;s foray into luxury spaceflight, it seems like the only place we can go from here is up (literally)! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://apps.bea.gov/scb/2019/12-december/1219-commercial-space.htm""&gt;“The Space Foundation (2019), a nonprofit advocacy organization, reported global space activity to be $414.8 billion in 2018, with commercial space revenues representing 79 percent of total space activity”&lt;/a&gt;, and seeing that in and of itself should be nothing short of amazing. Before, space ventures had to be sponsored by, funded by, and engineered by the government and taxpayers. Now a private company can lead expeditions for space, and do it while being profitable, which is a big advancement for the economy in general, when private companies and self-reliant citizens can take on the harrowing task of expanding the horizons of mankind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ct7ivkzxjkv51.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=737418da70f4d1405be0df35fc1c3df54ce04ee5""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ct7ivkzxjkv51.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=737418da70f4d1405be0df35fc1c3df54ce04ee5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley analysis from 2017 believed that the current level of space revenue would be reached in 2023, when in actuality it has thrived beyond their expectations and has continued to grow unperturbed by the pandemic, and it may still continue to increase in liquidity, according to the firm Space Capital, the aerospace industry is fairing rather well during the Coronavirus, probably because it’s not super grounded in consumables but more in broadband, television, and defense. Two of these are industries that have continued to thrive and one is consistent regardless of conditions: &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/20/space-capital-q2-report-coronavirus-effect-on-space-investment-not-as-slow-as-feared.html""&gt;“Investments in space-based companies totaled $5.5 billion in the second quarter, down 23% from the record highs hit in 2019, the report said. The decrease was primarily due to a drop in capital invested in infrastructure companies, like those which build rockets and satellites, but was made up partially by an increase in space-based application companies. Total space investment this year is up to $12.1 billion, a slight increase compared to the same period last year, the report found.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with that being considered, you can almost say that the space industry has proven to be recession proof, and that’s not by necessity but it’s by our strive for innovation. Morgan Stanley also believes that due to the ever expanding need of bandwidth for autonomous driving, the costs to launch satellites into space will dramatically decrease. “While &lt;strong&gt;reusable rockets&lt;/strong&gt; will help drive those costs down, so too will the &lt;strong&gt;mass-production of satellites and the maturation of satellite technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, the cost to launch a satellite has declined to about $60 million, from $200 million, via reusable rockets, with a potential drop to as low as $5 million. And satellite mass production could decrease that cost from $500 million per satellite to $500,000.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SpaceX has recently made reusable rockets commonplace. &lt;a href=""https://www.thestreet.com/tech/news/maxar072020""&gt;SpaceX has also reduced the cost to transport 1kg of mass by a factor of 20&lt;/a&gt;, and this has let Maxar hitch rides with them so that they can run their geospatial mapping missions. Companies such as Maxar and others loosely involved in aerospace like Raytheon just needed the means to get out of the stratosphere, and companies like SpaceX have provided that for them. “&lt;a href=""https://qz.com/1774249/2020-is-the-year-of-the-1-trillion-space-economy/""&gt;SpaceX is hardly the only group making this bet: OneWeb, Telesat and Amazon are also investing billions in networks of thousands of internet connectivity satellites. Apple is also reportedly chasing the dream of space connectivity.&lt;/a&gt;” The purposes for each of these companies vary, from human spaceflight to IOT, which shows the vast diversity of businesses willing to expand into the expanses, and each of the different niches they occupy will have a sustainable spacetech sector soon in order to support further globalization, which ironically, won’t even be on the globe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many different industries will explore the possibilities that space offers their business, including defense, energy, mining, communications, and further into the future, communications and real estate. Aerospace and defense will get even more tied in as funding for Nasa is increased and Space Force advances, “that means more money for private companies in space, with half-a-dozen defense agencies already pumping millions into space start-ups building everything from radar networks to high-tech materials”. Lockheed, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and other legacy manufacturers may get revived for innovation that doesn’t require bloodshed but rather innovation that is used for covert operations and reconnaissance, and it may create a more defensive weapons industry rather than the current one, which is more focused on developing offensive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/specials/apollo50th/back.html#:%7E:text=These%20experiences%20and%20partnerships%20will,resupply%20the%20International%20Space%20Station""&gt;NASA is currently working on commercializing low earth orbit, and trying to return to the moon by 2024. &lt;/a&gt;Such advancements will lead to more companies using the low earth orbit around earth for various goals, and so the satellite technology developed by Maxar will be instrumental to the many companies wishing to do business in low earth orbit. Introducing satellites around other celestial objects is also a major potential for profit for Maxar. NASA is currently also working on lunar orbiters as part of the same project previously mentioned. One of the most expensive objects currently orbiting earth is the international space station. &lt;a href=""https://www.inverse.com/article/15852-nasa-chief-announces-a-2028-expiration-date-for-the-iss-it-is-inevitable""&gt;Its current expiry date is sometime in 2028&lt;/a&gt;. This gives Maxar another huge profit potential further in the future, as Maxar will be instrumental in whatever orbital project replaces the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Internet communication is currently being taken to space by Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary, which is launching hundreds of satellites into orbit to provide cheap satellite internet. SpaceX is taking advantage of faster speeds in the vacuum of space, along with the larger area that can be reached with communication infrastructure that is orbiting the earth. There are currently 895 starlink satellites, and 120 satellites are being launched every month to reach an end goal of 12000 satellites. A global communications network this large will inevitably require maintenance, which is an opportunity for Maxar to deploy their on-orbit satellite servicing technology, and as more traditional companies realize that they can provide low-latency, high speed internet from low earth orbit, Maxar’s clientele will grow in size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another venture in space is asteroid mining. Although companies in the past have failed in this field due to &lt;a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/26/134510/asteroid-mining-bubble-burst-history/""&gt;lack of funding&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-space-mining-asteroid-platinum-2017-4#:%7E:text=Goldman%20Sachs%3A%20space-mining%20for,is%20%27more%20realistic%20than%20perceived%27&amp;amp;text=Those%20economics%20make%20going%20into,be%20more%20realistic%20than%20perceived.""&gt;Goldman Sachs report&lt;/a&gt; finds that the cost of asteroid mining for precious metals and other substances is continuously getting cheaper. “Caltech has suggested an asteroid-grabbing spacecraft could cost $2.6bn.” While this seems like a large amount, it’s nothing that a dedicated company can’t achieve with the proper funding from several VC funds or an existing billionaire or company willing to invest in the field. Profits margins in such ventures are very high as well, as “a single asteroid the size of a football field could contain $25bn- $50bn worth of platinum.” An opportunity this profitable will not remain untouched for long. The use of satellites for asteroid mapping in this situation provides another potential profit for Maxar, as their geospatial technology is used by energy companies to locate sites to work on. This new form of mining would require massive collaboration between traditional equipment companies such as Caterpillar and aerospace companies like Lockheed, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and Boeing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, mining on other celestial bodies such as the moon can provide a fuel source to be used both on earth, and to power colonies. The European Space Agency, Indian Space Research Organization, and other companies are &lt;a href=""https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Space_for_Earth/Energy/Helium-3_mining_on_the_lunar_surface""&gt;interested in mining on the moon&lt;/a&gt; for helium-3 -a highly efficient source of nuclear power with nearly no waste or radiation- and also for other energy sources. Solar power is also being explored as a potential source of energy on the moon by companies such as Blue Origin. Solar power in space is much more efficient on the moon due to the lack of a filtering atmosphere. This presents a large profit potential for companies with the capital to set up mining stations and fusion reactors. This also presents a profit potential for Maxar, which can provide satellite imagery that’s essential to find helium-3 reserves and optimal locations for solar power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mining for energy sources on the moon will lead to faster development of colonies on other celestial bodies, as well as orbiting habitats. Commercial space stations alone make a“&lt;a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/industries-will-make-money-in-space/""&gt;new industry [that] is anticipated to generate $37 billion in the next decade alone&lt;/a&gt;.” Maxar’s on-orbit assembly and servicing technologies will be essential in a project that is aiming to create human habitats that orbit earth. Space colonization is also something that governments and several companies are working on. Permanent settlements allow for better management of mining operations and other projects in space. As a result, it’s likely that colonies will be established on the moon in the near future to manage mining, and later on Mars as part of a larger exploration plan. While Mars colonization might be further in the future, when NASA unveiled their Artemis program, which plans to go back to the moon in 2024, they also unveiled plans to establish outposts on the moon by 2028 (Yes, that’s only 8 years from now). Such an undertaking will require large amounts of planning and exploration far before it’s actually established, and Maxar’s robotics division provides robotics and automation capabilities which are critical to building and maintaining infrastructure for outposts and colonies on the moon. Maxar’s satellite imagery will also be essential for mapping the lunar surface prior to exploration, so a Lunar outpost will definitely be a close collaboration between Maxar and NASA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maxar and plenty of other aerospace companies will have tremendous growth opportunities in the future, and the space economy will only continue its expansion under our current STEM-focused environment. At the current rate, of growth (about 8% yearly) the revenues of the space industry will double in just 9 short years, meaning that we’re growing nearly twice as fast as expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTW would y&amp;#39;all be interested if I started writing this stuff on Medium or something?

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%.

Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. 

With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the \[Trump\] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

This week, my bot picked up insiders of 171 companies who transacted shares this past week. Here are some highlights:

1)  Highest Buy/Sell Ratio: Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)- supplier of solar tracking systems for solar panels. Note: they had their IPO on Thursday, October 15th.

|B/S Ratio|18.00 (18 purchases, 1 sale)|
|:-|:-|
|Total Purchased|712,430 ($28.89 million)|
|Total Sold|47,625,000 ($1.93 billion)|
|Weekly Return|7.83%|

\-Summary: More buying transactions than selling, but the one sale was pretty massive.

&amp;#x200B;

2)  Highest Purchase Value: Eargo Inc. (EAR)- hearing aid manufacturing company. 

|B/S Ratio|1.07 (64 purchase, 60 sales)|
|:-|:-|
|Total Purchased|71.2 million ($2.53 billion)|
|Total Sold|53.24 million ($1.89 billion)|
|Weekly Return|9.07%|

\- Summary: Tons of buying and selling for this company. They had a great weekly return, so keep watching to see if the trend continues.

&amp;#x200B;

3)  Highest Weekly Return: Konatel Inc. (KTEL)- wholesale discount telecom carrier.

|B/S Ratio|2.00 (2 purchases, 1 sale)|

|Total Purchased|2,050,000 ($184,500)|
|Total Sold|1,600,000 ($144,000)|
|Weekly Return|107.55%|

\- Summary: This is a penny stock so personally I would stay away from it. But they had a great week with a decent number of transactions.

4)  Interesting Transactions:

\- TSLA- B/S: 6.00, Purchased: 667,742 ($283.37 million), Sold: 1,250 ($530,462).

The fact that the stock market is going to crash soon is inevitable based on the amount of QE and such going on.

I was curious what indicators people are looking out for to predict the start of the crash. What kind of predictions are people making? I see allot of wild claims ranging from crashing in 2 years, to crashing within the next month, but people rarely provide justification.

My prediction is that the government will try and encourage as much spending as possible in the lead up to Christmas, and although many people have less money now I believe that they are going to be more willing to spend to compensate for an otherwise shitty year. This leaves people trying to scrape and save during the January period, which could possibly be the straw that breaks the camels back. So my guess is that stocks will take a turn in early Feb.

The company is working on new AirPods and new AirPods Pro, according to the report.

The new regular AirPods are said to launch as soon as the first half of 2021.

JV Aims to Disrupt the Data Center Transceiver Market with Superior Economics and Scale

TORONTO, Ontario, and Xiamen, PRC, October 22, 2020 – POET Technologies Inc. (“POET” or the “Company”) (TSX Venture: PTK; OTCQX: POETF), and Xiamen Sanan Integrated Circuit Co. Ltd. (”Sanan IC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanan Optoelectronics Co., Ltd. (Shanghai Stock Exchange, SSE: 600703) announced today that they have signed a definitive joint venture contract and have applied for the registration of Super Photonics Xiamen Co., Ltd.(“Super Photonics”) to offer a new generation of cost-effective, high-performance optical engines to transceiver module manufacturers, systems suppliers, data center operators and network providers globally.

POET and Sanan IC are forming Super Photonics with the signing today of the definitive joint venture agreements and the registration of the company in Xiamen, PRC. The venture has been capitalized with  a commitment of cash and manufacturing know-how from Sanan IC and intellectual property and design know-how from POET. Super Photonics will assemble, test, package and sell optical engines, a primary component of optical transceivers that transmit data between switches and servers in data centers and between data centers and metro areas.  Modular pluggable transceivers represent a major portion of the capital spending for equipment by companies such as Google, Alibaba, Facebook, Tencent and others engaged in building hyperscale data centers.

“Sanan IC is dedicating significant capital and management talent to this new joint venture,” said Raymond Cai, Chief Executive Officer of Sanan IC. “We strongly believe that by combining Sanan IC’s manufacturing capabilities and devices with POET’s advanced optical engine designs, Super Photonics will be able to offer highly attractive solutions to the data communications and telecommunications markets.”

“Super Photonics is both the culmination of a long path for POET and the beginning of a new phase in our growth and development as a company,” said Dr. Suresh Venkatesan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of POET Technologies, Inc. “We cannot overstate the importance of this moment and the depth of our commitment to making this joint venture a resounding success.”

Super Photonics intends to design, manufacture and sell products for a variety of applications, including optical engines for transceivers used in data centers and for the fiber-based segments of the 5G communications market, each among the highest growth segments of the data communications and telecommunications markets.

## Market Notes:

Today we kick off the last full week of trading before the election. Futures are pointing towards a red open.

Virus cases are on the rise as new restrictions are put in place across the country and around the world. 

Earnings season is in full swing. I expect a busy week ahead. The bears have the upper hand going in. Obviously, that could change, but I don't like to fight the trend.

## Watchlist:

**NTZ** is a low float, resistance at $7.50

**PRPH** is a low float, on watch

**VOXX** is a low float, support at $12.50

**SNSS** is a low float, resistance at $1.67

**BCOV** is a lowish float, resistance at $14

**AVXL** watching for a continuation

**NBEV** watching for a setup above $3

The only reason they are down is because Westpac had to sell their share in the company as they made a deal with afterpay. There is literally no reason for zip to be losing, this is potentially the best news the company has ever released. This isn't financial advice, just pointing out that there's no reason, in my opinion, for it to be down and it should go up as soon as people realise that.

This one will focus on Specific Clean Energy ETFs. I hope this post helps people who are interested in this topic.  
 

Before we go in, I'd like to share some potential Megatrends on Clean Energy:

1. 50% of the world’s energy is predicted to come from solar and wind by 2050, 7x the percentage in 2015.
2. $2T is the total investment needed by 2030 to implement government renewable energy targets.
3. Renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040.

(Source: [https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/product-brief/ishares-megatrends-global-clean-energy-etf-product-brief-en-us.pdf](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/product-brief/ishares-megatrends-global-clean-energy-etf-product-brief-en-us.pdf))

The *current* general thesis for Clean Energy plays heavily with the concepts stated above along with others.

One note to address before we go in is that these funds are non-diversified: when you invest in these funds, you are SOLELY investing in Clean Energy. Do not confuse this with global diversification, these funds are very focused investments and they all have under 100 holdings

**The ETFs**

First Trust Global Wind NRG ETF (FAN) - This one has the lowest ER out of three standing at 0.62%. FAN contains about 30 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 54.09%. This ETF is very globally diversified, the top 3 countries are Denmark (19.23%), Canada (18.05%), and Spain (14.40%) standing. The US comes in 4th place standing at 10.40% for anyone interested. This ETF tracks the ISE Clean Edge Global Wind Energy Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. The ETFs weighting consists of 66.67% 'Pure-Plays' (companies that provide goods and services exclusively to the wind energy industry) and 40% 'Diversified Category' (companies that are determined to be significant participants in the wind energy industry despite not being exclusive to such industry). Overall, this ETF focuses on the CORE components of Wind Energy.

Invesco Solar ETF *(TAN)* \- This one has the 2nd lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.71%. TAN contains about 27 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 63.62%. This ETF is globally diversified, the top 3 countries are The US (57.87%), Hong Kong (14.26%), and China (7.12%) This ETF tracks the MAC Global Solar NRG Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. Similar to FAN, this ETF also weighs itself through the concepts of 'Pure-Plays' (companies that provide goods and services exclusively to the solar energy industry) and 'Diversified Category' (companies that are determined to be significant participants in the solar energy industry despite not being exclusive to such industry), boosting weight for 'Pure-Plays' and underweighting 'Diversified Category.' Overall, this ETF focuses on the CORE components of Solar Energy.

Global X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech ETF *(LIT)* \- This one has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.75%. LIT contains about 43 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 59.91%. This ETF is globally diversified, the top 3 countries are, similar to TAN, China (30.94%), The US (24.12%), and Hong Kong (13.22%). A lot of Chinese weight, please research this carefully. China is still considered an Emerging Market so this is a very unique weighting situation. Anyways, this ETF tracks the Solactive Global Lithium Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. This ETF is unique because it focuses on the Full Lithium Cycle which means it offers exposure to the Metal/Mining, Lithium Refining, and Battery Production Segments. This ETF is similar in some ways to Commodity Metal ETFs, keep this in mind if you plan on going further with this.

What I provided is very brief. If you're serious about Clean Energy, you must read each ETFs fact sheet along with the prospectuses. This will educate you on the field more and provide more crucial data for each fund.

The main difference between each of these ETFs really comes down to the underlying holdings, sector allocations, and global diversification. Analyze your Risk Tolerance and Circle Of Competence in terms of holding/sector/globality for each fund before making a decision.

**Lonsdale**: ""If someone calls for the end of private equity, they are basically saying that there should be no competition for the big banks and pension funds that hold almost all of today’s capital. Far from an all-powerful behemoth, private equity today represents an important corrective to more centralized investors on the American scene.

Matt cites a handful of cases, without numbers or evidence, where he says private equity has wrecked an industry, or “looted” it. Yet there are a wealth of studies, including one that looked at over 35,000 manufacturing plants, which have showed that private equity buyouts [cause substantial increases in productivity](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/0034653053327540). And few would deny that the U.S. venture capital industry, which still has over 50% of the global market, is one reason the U.S. creates the world’s most successful companies, such as Amazon, Google, and Apple.

Private equity also can’t be blamed for “monopolization,” since concentration has actually decreased in recent years. The Fortune 500 firms have a lower percent of all workers and profits than they did back in 1980. And private equity helps explain why Fortune’s list only has 20% of the same companies as in 1960. Private equity [helps create a dynamic economy](http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/economics/docs/workingpapers/2017/White_WhatHasBeenHappeningtoAggregateConcentrationintheUSEconomyinthe21stCentury.pdf) with real turnover and competition, not stasis.

Matt somehow manages to blame the small private equity industry for recent declines in productivity and even life expectancy. Yet America experienced a doubling in productivity growth between 1995 and 2005, just as the private equity industry took off. And although the financial crisis put a damper on that growth, private equity neither caused the collapse nor received the federal bailouts that big banks and corporations got. I think the decline in life expectancy since 2015, as the economy grew, can hardly be laid at the feet of a few private equity investors.

In sum, private equity is a small but essential part of today’s capital market. It counteracts the tendencies of concentrated and run-prone banks with stable and nimble funding for new ideas. As a nation, we should be excited about the prospects for this industry.""",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,549085,public,confidence,self,Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale on why private equity matters,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ji3o7m/palantir_cofounder_joe_lonsdale_on_why_private/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'e15rm8wnD9f0Q2_kE6cwcFdJ6unSkHS_DhpTXfIOMP4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zbz7VOhGteUllJysuFPFfP3Oz4tSkbOxtgPi3NFWhFM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a744c9d59a2dc6e37d6085e13008b4c383de9b21', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zbz7VOhGteUllJysuFPFfP3Oz4tSkbOxtgPi3NFWhFM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52f8a2d10713ae6d26970fac739352de3f1efe42', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zbz7VOhGteUllJysuFPFfP3Oz4tSkbOxtgPi3NFWhFM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f68142fe1ae9e124ba32549e616a51f42e65f49', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zbz7VOhGteUllJysuFPFfP3Oz4tSkbOxtgPi3NFWhFM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3952df462f9fd5160d319e020dee872c96a2532f', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 600, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zbz7VOhGteUllJysuFPFfP3Oz4tSkbOxtgPi3NFWhFM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1cb4598bf5b7544b99393dca2a3e53675fdd2ac9', 'width': 900}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

I use mostly technical analysis with some fundamentals mixed in.

The more and more I learn and research into this it seems most all full time traders day and swing are trading options. Is that true?

**Introduction**

With the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation &amp; Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. 

**Finding our compatible companies.** 

I only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) 

1. Carrier (Day&amp;Night, Bryant, Toshiba &amp; 15 more)

2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King &amp; 7 more). 

3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). 

4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). 

5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)

**Understanding the HVAC market.**

Before we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.

Some facts: 

1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. 

2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. 

3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).

4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.

5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).

6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.

As can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.

\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.

\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.

\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.

\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.

\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.

\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.

**Market share.**

This was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:

\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.

\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.

\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.

\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.

\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%

My conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.

**Conclusion**

First of all, I should start with saying that Lennox really shouldn’t have been included, they are on a completely different level than these 4 other companies. Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.

Looking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:

\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.

\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.

\- Daikin spends the most on R&amp;D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.

\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.

\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.

\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise

\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.

\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. 

\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio

\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.

\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M

Now on to the less financial aspect of the data.

I really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.

To conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration.

Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors remains pro-big tech. His bull thesis: “People have to keep in mind that the five largest tech companies make more in earnings than the entire Russell 2000 combined, so this isn’t the internet bubble.”

Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller &amp; Washington LLC contends that fundamentals are driving capital into big tech, and a divestment due to current headwinds would be “a sucker’s trade.”

With all of that in mind, here are 10 tech stocks to buy for 2021:

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)

[Netflix Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NFLX:US) is moving into a new London headquarters that will triple the amount of its West End office space, as the streaming giant expands the production of television shows in the U.K.

The producer of programs including “The Crown” is taking over the lease on an 87,000 square-foot (8,082 square-meter) office building on Berners Street from current occupant [Capita Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CPI:LN), according to people with knowledge of the deal who asked not to be identified because the information is private.

Netflix, which has 269 employees in the U.K., currently rents about 30,000 square feet of space in two nearby buildings, one of which will be retained, one of the people said. The changes will give the company a total of about 100,000 square feet of office space in the capital.

“As part of our ongoing commitment to the U.K., we are excited to expand our operations in London,” a Netflix spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “It will ensure that we can better serve our members and the local creative community.”

Netflix Co-Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings is no fan of remote working, which has prompted questions about the outlook for commercial workspace since the onset of Covid-19. He said in a Wall Street Journal interview last month that not being able to get together in person, especially internationally, is a “pure negative.” A lot of companies will end up having employees work four days a week in the office and one from home, he said.

The company [added](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QDMADMT0G1KY) almost as many subscribers in the first half of this year as it achieved in the whole of 2019, as consumers enduring widespread lockdowns reached for their remotes. The company’s shares are up more than 60% this year.

Technology firms have become a vital source of demand for London offices, which have seen demand hit by Brexit and the pandemic. Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google owner Alphabet Inc. have all signed deals for major new headquarters in the city in the past few years, surpassing banks as the dominant source of demand for trophy office developments.

Capita, a business-process outsourcing firm, is giving up the lease on the Berners Street building as its employees spend more time working from home, according to an emailed company statement. It will shift its headquarters to its offices on Gresham Street in the City of London.

“It is clear our colleagues want to work in a more flexible way, which will involve increased working from home, but they will still spend a significant amount of their time working from offices that are based in their local towns and cities,” a spokesperson said in the statement.

best known for making equipment and software for next generation sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression. Genetic sequencing is simply acquiring the specific sequence of base pairs in a strand of DNA, and this sequence can be analyzed through genotype analysis to extract a variety of information such as diagnosing variants of cancer and study rare variants through finding differences between normal DNA and mutated DNA. Genome sequencing was used during the ebola outbreak to monitor live mutations in the virus’s DNA. Characterizing genetic variation and using our biological differences as strengths against pathogens and other life-threatening ailments is obviously a very important sector to understand as it has directly to do with the wellbeing of people (mostly developed countries with the means to afford access to such technology). Illumina’s innovation in this field will not only make genetic sequencing more affordable, it’ll make it a widespread solution for all sorts of individual genome related problems. Illumina in 2014 had reduced the cost of sequencing a human genome to $1,000, down from a price of $1 million in 2007. Not only that, but Illumina’s products make their way into the agricultural sector, where it helps agrigenomics, which is the use of genome analysis in crops and livestock. According to Illumina, “Researchers can identify natural and novel genomic variation and deploy genome-wide marker-based applications to accelerate breeding and production of healthier and higher-yielding crops and livestock”. Beyond accelerating artificial selection of desirable crops, genome sequencing also helps with the improvement of GMO crops. Genome sequencing helps scientists link certain genetic sequences with a positive phenotype (phenotypes are the observable characteristics caused by certain genes). For example, if scientists use Illumina’s genome sequencing technology and find that in all rot-resistant tomatoes, there is a common genetic sequence, they can use gene editing technology to insert these genes in all the tomatoes or use the aforementioned marker-based applications to make it easier to selectively breed the rot-resistant tomatoes. Outside of these consumer markets Illumina has a lot of penetration in clinical genomics as well, especially in the previously discussed issue of cancer detection and analysis. For cancer genomics, Illumina’s goal is to “identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one. Understanding these genomic changes will improve diagnostic accuracy, increase understanding of the prognosis, and enable oncologists to target therapies to individuals”. Illumina has also acquired GRAIL, a company that can target early onset cancers using blood by capturing cfNA in the bloodstream. Gene editing in crops for agriculture, however, isn’t the only use of gene editing. New gene editing technology called CRISPR is “a powerful technology that allows scientists to quickly target, delete and repair any mutated sequence of DNA in any gene” [according to Stanford Medicine](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2018winter/CRISPR-for-gene-editing-is-revolutionary-but-it-comes-with-risks.html). This new CRISPR technology is being tested for human health care as [reported by Time](https://time.com/5642755/crispr-gene-editing-humans/). The human genome was first reliably and precisely spliced with CRISPR 7 years ago, and these recent trials are promising as human gene editing has the potential to fix “genetic diseases ranging from sickle cell anemia to certain types of cancer and even blindness.” With the human health industry being such a large industry worth trillions of dollars, the ability to cure genetic diseases will be revolutionary and in high demand. Since every human is genetically unique, the health industry will need a large supply of genome sequencing technology, and Illumina’s sequencing technology, which reduced the cost of sequencing a human genome to $1,000, down from a price of $1 million in 2007, will be the best option. Of course, the premise for this increased demand in the future (due to the development of gene editing in humans) is just speculation based on current human trials, but based on what is being seen, and the possibilities for this technology, it is likely that it will be adopted, generating another huge market for Illumina’s technology.\n\nIn terms of where their revenue comes from, 2/3 of it is from consumables and the rest is from services and instruments. Consumables are the sequencing kits themselves, which are much heavier in sales volume than the instruments which are far more expensive and not as many are needed for labs. The totality of sequencing services, instruments, and consumables Illumina provides makes up 87% of their total revenue. According to Illumina it’s because of their innovation that sequencing has been made more accessible: “Since we launched our first sequencing system in 2007, our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by a factor of more than 10,000. In addition, the sequencing time per Gb has dropped by a factor of approximately 12,000”, which is an astronomical reduction in cost and hopefully at some point we can get to a stage where any individual can afford genome sequencing services. Illumina has tremendous integration in this business space as they provide a cloud analytics software to accompany instruments and sequencing kits. The BaseSpace Information Suite “integrates directly with our sequencing instruments, allowing customers to manage their biological sample and sequencing runs, process and analyze the raw genomic data, and derive meaningful results.”\n\nNot only this, but their software “facilitates data sharing, provides data-storage solutions and streamlines analysis through a growing number of applications developed by us and the bioinformatics community”. Being able to create a scalable solution for genomic analysis is just one of the many things that has given Illumina so much pricing power in this space. Arrays are where the other 11% of Illumina’s revenues come from and this is the technology that is used in consumer genomics. This technology has a chance to expand when genetic analysis becomes more of a luxury rather than just something for a medical industry. Arrays are used to measure gene expression. Illumina is expecting to continue to improve these systems, which is indicated by their desire to increment R&amp;D spending once again as they reported the following their most recent annual filing: “Research and development expense in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $647 million, $623 million, and $546 million, respectively. We expect research and development expense to increase during 2020 to support business growth and continuing expansion in research and product-development efforts”. This means the company does not yet have a fully developed competitive advantage, and that means it’s still at risk of being overtaken by a competitor which makes it a growth stock/speculative. Usually though, you’re far better off buying before the advantage is developed (at which point the company will taper off) which is why the growth stage tends to offer the best returns. Illumina also doesn’t plan on paying dividends any time soon, but Illumina does conduct stock buybacks which improves return on equity and return on assets as cash is offloaded and the total amount of equity available to the public decreases.\n\nRegarding Illumina’s finances, the company is relatively healthy. The debt/equity ratio is 0.25 which may lower returns due to lower leverage but also it makes it far more recession resistant. EPS is forecasted to grow by 56% next year, and Illumina’s great margins will be what allows for that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mb9lofgxl2v51.png?width=226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c3d068158ec95407dd4a82306458369cd8b32df\n\nBut as you can see, the gap for operating expenses is pretty big and net cash inflows from operations have decreased from 2018–2019 as R&amp;D expenses and investment outflows due to GRAIL shot up (see bottom line for net cash from operations):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vc80kyzl2v51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871f583ac3435304719004113e8fc8d2590a531e\n\nWhile consolidated net income has increased drastically YoY, the expenses and investment outflows have consistently weighed down cash flows, and this is partly due to the GRAIL acquisition, which brought the stock price down from 400 to nearly 283 (where I first saw the best position to enter) and since then it has rebounded back to the 315 range. The thing is, now the investments are generating positive cash flows for Illumina. Although operating cash flow has flattened out, cash flow from investments has finally turned positive, which shows that while operations may not be consistent yet, they will consolidate more in the future as investment cash flow starts becoming positive. The long term implications for this strategy suggests that management has less of a cost-cutting and cash scraping mentality but rather that they tend to go for growth. They believe in their products so they continue to reinvest cash and spend more on R&amp;D as the future prospect for their product grows, especially during a pandemic which selectively targets certain **partially gene-based traits** such as diabetes/heart disease vulnerable populations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihf4i1p2m2v51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6464b6f8f3218adba5d10da6faf5ee269184efab\n\nThe best news one could take away from the recent annual report is that Illumina has begun to pay down debt as financial cash flows were heavily reduced in 2019:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52fqd5n4m2v51.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2944328f5f573baa658467bf8f545d0f9598bc05\n\nIf financing cash flow was negative, it means Illumina paid back more in debt than it took in and conducted stock buybacks, which shows that it’s consolidating itself more in the conservative healthcare sector. Due to the net decrease in financing cash flows, net cash and cash equivalents were counted as an **increase** and cash from the beginning to the end of the year increased from 1.14B to 2.04B. As you can see, common stock repurchases also increased by over 50% in 2019 from 201M in 2018 to 324B most recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tg04w86m2v51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28ac46c57bdbe42b1be08898e02d72b57b6b0561\n\nAnd now for a quick time series summary of financials:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[consistently rising gross profit](https://preview.redd.it/3q6on4k8m2v51.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d6dc81dc2531e405b25b9a0decdeac743038968)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Decrease in interest rate spending per $ of gross profit](https://preview.redd.it/5wuarfq9m2v51.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6097c8b59f3bcaea261c1b7dfe1a490c1f17866f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Despite increased R&amp;D spending, as a &amp;#37; of gross profit it has declined due to the massive increase in profits.](https://preview.redd.it/u3ijkiecm2v51.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c1adaaeb4129f384653023d2d5beb813d495b91)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[EBITDA margin has increased since 2019 due to positive investment cash flow, lower debt](https://preview.redd.it/04omgu5em2v51.png?width=411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a322f7cb31f4c87bee7346b8b244c2ea91cec42a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Historically increasing operating cash flows](https://preview.redd.it/u0gpnfnfm2v51.png?width=436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5787776ff5a428bae92c66c15c033934cf49fc6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Better debt coverage now](https://preview.redd.it/ms6c3x7im2v51.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed07280a0804f6b19b96719a931c1e28e3723a8f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[P\\/E Ratio decreased slightly even though earnings shot up](https://preview.redd.it/lxw16xvjm2v51.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f239a241e493df5c5cd809e7ea24f927f61e2000)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More cash means more liquidity and long-term security](https://preview.redd.it/4thb6r0mm2v51.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea2074f7945174413f55e9511ef720447087ebbc)\n\nBottom line: Despite selling a relatively new and innovative product, Illumina maintains steady financials and exponential growth. Setting out to revolutionize healthcare is no easy feat, but with financials like these and the pricing power they have on genetic sequencing makes them the biggest competitor in this space. Illumina has nearly half of its customers outside of the US making its consumer base very well diversified. It doesn’t have too much of its revenue come from just one customer either, so this is another sign of a stable and growth-oriented company. However, it may be a bit too late for investors to see immediate gains, so I’d start with a small position and continue to average down rather than go in for the short term.\n\nRegardless of your cost, Illumina’s technology is set up to make it a huge gainer in the future.\n\nPositions: Shares LOL', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr Illumina is really profitable for a growth stock and its technology will be industry leading when a serious health-tech revolution happens&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Illumina is best known for making equipment and software for next generation sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression. Genetic sequencing is simply acquiring the specific sequence of base pairs in a strand of DNA, and this sequence can be analyzed through genotype analysis to extract a variety of information such as diagnosing variants of cancer and study rare variants through finding differences between normal DNA and mutated DNA. Genome sequencing was used during the ebola outbreak to monitor live mutations in the virus’s DNA. Characterizing genetic variation and using our biological differences as strengths against pathogens and other life-threatening ailments is obviously a very important sector to understand as it has directly to do with the wellbeing of people (mostly developed countries with the means to afford access to such technology). Illumina’s innovation in this field will not only make genetic sequencing more affordable, it’ll make it a widespread solution for all sorts of individual genome related problems. Illumina in 2014 had reduced the cost of sequencing a human genome to $1,000, down from a price of $1 million in 2007. Not only that, but Illumina’s products make their way into the agricultural sector, where it helps agrigenomics, which is the use of genome analysis in crops and livestock. According to Illumina, “Researchers can identify natural and novel genomic variation and deploy genome-wide marker-based applications to accelerate breeding and production of healthier and higher-yielding crops and livestock”. Beyond accelerating artificial selection of desirable crops, genome sequencing also helps with the improvement of GMO crops. Genome sequencing helps scientists link certain genetic sequences with a positive phenotype (phenotypes are the observable characteristics caused by certain genes). For example, if scientists use Illumina’s genome sequencing technology and find that in all rot-resistant tomatoes, there is a common genetic sequence, they can use gene editing technology to insert these genes in all the tomatoes or use the aforementioned marker-based applications to make it easier to selectively breed the rot-resistant tomatoes. Outside of these consumer markets Illumina has a lot of penetration in clinical genomics as well, especially in the previously discussed issue of cancer detection and analysis. For cancer genomics, Illumina’s goal is to “identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one. Understanding these genomic changes will improve diagnostic accuracy, increase understanding of the prognosis, and enable oncologists to target therapies to individuals”. Illumina has also acquired GRAIL, a company that can target early onset cancers using blood by capturing cfNA in the bloodstream. Gene editing in crops for agriculture, however, isn’t the only use of gene editing. New gene editing technology called CRISPR is “a powerful technology that allows scientists to quickly target, delete and repair any mutated sequence of DNA in any gene” &lt;a href=""https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2018winter/CRISPR-for-gene-editing-is-revolutionary-but-it-comes-with-risks.html""&gt;according to Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. This new CRISPR technology is being tested for human health care as &lt;a href=""https://time.com/5642755/crispr-gene-editing-humans/""&gt;reported by Time&lt;/a&gt;. The human genome was first reliably and precisely spliced with CRISPR 7 years ago, and these recent trials are promising as human gene editing has the potential to fix “genetic diseases ranging from sickle cell anemia to certain types of cancer and even blindness.” With the human health industry being such a large industry worth trillions of dollars, the ability to cure genetic diseases will be revolutionary and in high demand. Since every human is genetically unique, the health industry will need a large supply of genome sequencing technology, and Illumina’s sequencing technology, which reduced the cost of sequencing a human genome to $1,000, down from a price of $1 million in 2007, will be the best option. Of course, the premise for this increased demand in the future (due to the development of gene editing in humans) is just speculation based on current human trials, but based on what is being seen, and the possibilities for this technology, it is likely that it will be adopted, generating another huge market for Illumina’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of where their revenue comes from, 2/3 of it is from consumables and the rest is from services and instruments. Consumables are the sequencing kits themselves, which are much heavier in sales volume than the instruments which are far more expensive and not as many are needed for labs. The totality of sequencing services, instruments, and consumables Illumina provides makes up 87% of their total revenue. According to Illumina it’s because of their innovation that sequencing has been made more accessible: “Since we launched our first sequencing system in 2007, our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by a factor of more than 10,000. In addition, the sequencing time per Gb has dropped by a factor of approximately 12,000”, which is an astronomical reduction in cost and hopefully at some point we can get to a stage where any individual can afford genome sequencing services. Illumina has tremendous integration in this business space as they provide a cloud analytics software to accompany instruments and sequencing kits. The BaseSpace Information Suite “integrates directly with our sequencing instruments, allowing customers to manage their biological sample and sequencing runs, process and analyze the raw genomic data, and derive meaningful results.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only this, but their software “facilitates data sharing, provides data-storage solutions and streamlines analysis through a growing number of applications developed by us and the bioinformatics community”. Being able to create a scalable solution for genomic analysis is just one of the many things that has given Illumina so much pricing power in this space. Arrays are where the other 11% of Illumina’s revenues come from and this is the technology that is used in consumer genomics. This technology has a chance to expand when genetic analysis becomes more of a luxury rather than just something for a medical industry. Arrays are used to measure gene expression. Illumina is expecting to continue to improve these systems, which is indicated by their desire to increment R&amp;amp;D spending once again as they reported the following their most recent annual filing: “Research and development expense in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $647 million, $623 million, and $546 million, respectively.

“It has now become a “new normal” that many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees. For instance, the 459 companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index in January 2016 that were publicly listed over the ten-year period 2006-2015 expended $3.9 trillion on stock buybacks, representing 53.6 percent of net income, plus another 36.7 percent of net income on dividends. Much of the remaining 9.7 percent of profits was held abroad, sheltered from U.S. taxes”.

""As Steven Solomon commented, “companies, frankly, are scared” and “\[their\] mantra … is to settle with hedge funds before it gets to a fight over the control of a company.”

&amp;#x200B;

""An impetus for the phenomenal growth of the hedge fund industry and the consequent rise

of hedge-fund activism was provided by the 1996 National Securities Markets Improvement Act

(NSMIA), which was part of financial market deregulation during the Clinton administration.

According to David Dayen who delved into NSMIA’s implications for hedge funds, the regulatory

change, “largely unnoticed at the time” and “advanced with broad Wall Street support and almost no resistance in Congress,”effectively allowed hedge funds to pool unlimited financial

resources from institutional investors without regulations that would have required disclosure

of the structure of their firms or prohibited overly speculative investments.""

Like many retailers that have had to shift amid the coronavirus pandemic, the new ""Express"" format changes the classic layout of the Apple store by integrating a wall towards the storefront and using plexiglass on the sales counters to separate employees from customers.

The concept was first tested last month at the Burlingame, California location, Engadget reported. There are now around 20 Express stores in the US and Europe with plans to grow to 50 stores by the end of October, senior vice president of retail and people at Apple Deirdre O'Brien told Reuters.

(Bloomberg) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. held discussions with Apple Inc. and Netflix Inc. about taking its new James Bond film directly to streaming, according to people familiar with the situation, but the studio says it’s committed to a theatrical release.

The film, “No Time to Die,” could fetch hundreds of millions of dollars in a potential streaming sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. MGM declined to comment on any talks, but said the film “is not for sale.”

Nabbing the rights to “No Time to Die,” would have been a major coup for a streaming service and could have helped entice subscribers looking to watch the latest Bond movie. The Daniel Craig film, which cost about $250 million to produce, would be the most notable movie to switch to streaming due to the pandemic, though other films have taken a similar route.

Finally apple is start to paying attention to streaming. Apple currently has a lot of cash on hand, so it could easily to spend them to buying up contents.

This post will focus on breaking down the differences between 3 of the largest clean energy ETFs, QCLN, ICLN, and PBW. The focus will be exclusively on these ETFs and not single stocks. Now is an excellent time to invest in clean energy, According to several sources, renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040. For the US alone almost $2 trillion is the investment needed to implement renewable energy targets by 2030.

NOTE: It would be wise to keep a long-term investing mindset. Investments that focus on particular segments of the market can see significant short-term fluctuations in price. Additionally, in the past 10 years, clean energy ETFs have had returns that range from low single-digit gains to low single-digit declines.

Alrighty let's get into it.

# ICLN - iShares Global Clean Energy ETF :

Between the 3, ICLN currently has the most assets under management at $2.05B and the lowest expense ratio at 0.46%, however, it is also the least diversified, having only 30 current holdings. This ETF tracks the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index. ICLN holds a portfolio of 'clean energy' companies, such as biofuels, ethanol, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar and wind industries. Additionally it also holds companies that develop technology and equipment used in the process. It does not have exposure to the Electric Vehicle Market! Of these 3 it has the most Global Exposure.

Top 10 sectors (5 in this case since it doesn't even have 10):

* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **59.31%**
* Electric Utilities - **25.80%**
* Independent Power Producers - **9.28%**
* Multiline Utilities - **3.28%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.32%**

Top 10 holdings: SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.50%,** Plug Power Inc. **7.21%,** Sunrun Inc. **7.16%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.97%,** Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd **6.24%,** First Solar, Inc **4.88%,** Vestas Wind Systems A/S **4.53%,** Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. **4.50%,** Contact Energy Limited**3.48%,** Boralex Inc. Class A **3.42%. (NOTE** Total Top 10 Weighting - **55.89%)**

# QCLN - First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy ETF:

QCLN currently has $756 million assets under management with the middle expense ratio at 0.60%. Additionally, between these 3 ETFs, it is the second-most diversified with 43 current holdings. This ETF tracks the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index, which, compared to the previous, includes a mix of U.S. and Canadian clean energy companies. For this ETF companies are from the following four sub-sectors: advanced materials (that enable clean-energy/reduce need for oil products), energy intelligence (smart grid), energy storage and conversion (hybrid batteries), or renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, geothermal, etc).

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **32.34%**
* Auto &amp; Truck Manufacturers - **23.97%**
* Semiconductors - **13.18%**
* Electric Utilities - **7.40%**
* Electrical Components &amp; Equipment - **6.97%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **5.97%**
* Independent Power Producers - **3.21%**
* Construction Supplies &amp; Fixtures - **2.45%**
* Commercial REITs - **1.70%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **0.84%**

Top 10 Holdings: NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **10.00%,** SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.03%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.53%,** Tesla Inc **5.94%,** Albemarle Corporation **5.06%,** ON Semiconductor Corporation **4.21%,** Brookfield Renewable Partners LP **4.08%,** Cree, Inc. **3.96%,** Universal Display Corporation **3.81%,** First Solar, Inc. **3.75%. (NOTE:** Total Top 10 Weighting - **54.37%)**

# PBW - Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF:

PBW currently has $962 million assets under management with the highest expense ratio of 0.70%, however it is also the most diversified with 48 current holdings. PBW is more diverse than just industry pure-plays like wind, solar, and biofuels, it aims to include companies based on their perceived relevance to the renewable energy space as well. Additionally, it follows a tiered, equal-weighting structure and caps any holding to a tax of 4%.

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **44.46%**
* Auto &amp; Truck Manufacturers - **13.70%**
* Semiconductors - **7.36%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **6.74%**
* Construction &amp; Engineering - **4.47%**
* Industrial Machinery &amp; Equipment - **3.97%**
* Electric Utilities - **3.40%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **3.17%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.76%**
* Agricultural Chemicals - **2.17%**

Top 10 Holdings: (Remember 4% cap) JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. Sponsored ADR **3.85%,** NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **3.12%,** Lithium Americas Corp. **3.06%,** Daqo New Energy Corp. Sponsored ADR **3.02%,** SunPower Corporation **2.93%,** Livent Corporation **2.85%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **2.69%,** SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **2.68%,** Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. **2.61%,** Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile S.A. Sponsored ADR Pfd Class B **2.49%.**

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

Clean energy has a very bright future but the industry is still emerging. For this reason, market risk and price volatility may be higher than the broader market, and ETFs may be more favorable compared to individual stocks.

**For those looking for a Clean Energy ETF that has more Global Exposure and is more diversified than ICLN, I would recommend checking out PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF.**

As always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement, and if anyone else has any other great Clean Energy ETFs that they may prefer please comment!

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.

# **There’s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**
*****
&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter’s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.
*****
&gt; “For some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.
*****
&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average is down 1.2% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.
*****
&gt; “We’ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. “If she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we’ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there’s still some significant areas that we’re working through.”
*****
&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.
*****
&gt; “It’s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “So I’m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it’s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It’s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.”
*****
&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.
*****
&gt; “The market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It’s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,” said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden’s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.
*****
&gt; “We are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,” said Grohowski. “I think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.”
*****
&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.
*****
&gt; “As we get closer to the election, we’re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,” said Grohowski.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. “Active managers have the most net long positions they’ve had in a number of years because they’re fearful of missing a year-end rally,” said Emanuel. “The options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.
*****
&gt; “What we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It’s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,” Emanuel said.
*****
&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.

&gt; Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance

&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.

&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**

&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.

&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.

&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery

&gt; The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing—a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers’ new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.

&gt; “It comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “However, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.”

&gt; The decline in manufacturers’ new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.

&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time

&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:

&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.
&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.
&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.
&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.

&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.

&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.

&gt; # ""Quitters""

&gt; Like an old pair of ""quitters"" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**

&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.

&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders

&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**

&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.

Stocks once again traded very choppily, with the market pulling back before reversing intraday to finish mixed. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around stimulus talks, rising coronavirus infections, and the final presidential debate last night. 

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) performed the best today, finishing the day 0.29% up. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.2%, and the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell a modest 0.11%.

It appears almost certain that there will not be additional stimulus before the November election, a mere eleven days away. House Speaker Pelosi still thinks it’s possible for a bill to pass before the election, but says it’s up to President Trump. She said, “We put pen to paper… we are writing the bill, and hopefully we will be able to resolve it… we could do that before the election if the president wants to.” Any additional stimulus will likely include a new round of checks and more money for unemployment benefits, schools, state, and local governments. 

This morning, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg TV that “the ball’s not really moving much right now” in discussions, and that he “doesn’t want to make any predictions about the timing of an agreement.”

Unfortunately, in the US, around 71,600 new cases were recorded yesterday, according to data from John Hopkins. According to CBS News that is the fourth-highest number of new infections reported in the country since the pandemic began and the highest number reported since July. During the debate candidate Joe Biden warned of a “dark winter coming” and once again urged the public to wear masks and follow federal social distancing guidelines. President Trump, on the other hand, incorrectly claimed that the virus was “going away” and that the US is “rounding the corner.” These statements were meant with severe criticism from health officials and are simply not true from a number’s perspective, the country is averaging more than 50,000 new infections a day and it appears to be climbing.

In Europe, governments and health officials are scrambling to deal with a surge of infections across the continent, with many fearing a second wave. Millions across Europe are now facing tougher coronavirus restrictions. Italy, France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere are introducing curfews in large regions of the country in a bid to stem the recent spike in cases. In England, the government has imposed restrictions in the capital of London and in cities in the Northern parts of the country.

**Highlights**

* Intel (INTC) sold off more than 10% after the company unexpectedly posted a quarterly decline in data center chip sales, driven by a near-halving of revenue from enterprise and government clients during the pandemic.
* Today, remdesivir, Gilead’s (GILD) antiviral treatment, became the first drug to receive formal approval by the FDA to treat Covid-19. The drug was used as part of President Trump’s treatment after his diagnosis earlier this month.
* Tesla (TSLA) plans to recall more than 29,000 of its Model S and Model X vehicles from China after problems with the cars' front and rear suspension were discovered.
* Wells Fargo (WFC) is reportedly planning to sell its asset management business for around $3 billion.
* AstraZeneca (AZN) reported that its COVID-19 vaccine trial will resume in the U.S. The Phase 3 clinical trial for the vaccine candidate that the company is developing with the University of Oxford was placed on hold in multiple countries over concern about an unexplained illness. The trial has already been restarted in the U.K.
* Remark Holdings (MARK) jumped 39% in late-afternoon trading on Friday after the company tweeted that for the first time, the company is selling its technologies in partnership with Intel (INTC)
* Joe Biden's remarks Thursday that he would seek to phase out oil stoked concerns among some oil and gas executives that a Democratic administration would further weigh down an industry hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

It is estimated that more than 1,800 of these firms disappeared into consolidations, many of which acquired substantial shares of the markets in which they operated”.

my portfolio is around tech/clean energy/future innovation.

I was heavily thinking of just selling everything else and putting it into long term etfs liks VTI and then putting into individual sectors like arkk, arkw, icln etc 

should i just keep the things i have right now?, all look promising, will gradually buy every month or two a few more shares of etfs or blue chips like msft

Im still relatively new to this, started late september and im 18. Put some money that was laying around doing nothing to maybe benefit me during the later years.

If i wanted long term just sell everything and buy etfs???

People don't like that since it hits their ego. So I created more enemies than friends and my energy has been depleting.    


However, I've also learned that I am very hard worker, ambitious, risk taker (and risk manager), and very patient. I love maths, physics, finance(crypto too), can code well and love to make money. Last but not least, I tend to be very peaceful in most situations.  


So I was experimenting with trading the past 2 years(5hrs/week) and feels like I deal with THE MARKET (which has some sort of patterns) compared to dealing with multiple individuals in business (whose patterns can't be determined). So far thing has been okay since I was just investing little money but now need to make a slow but steady moves to add more to my portfolio.   


**Cons**  
\- Less leverage since I won't be raising money. Yes I can do leverage trading but you are the only risk taker compared to a star-up who has multiple risk takers.

**Pros**  
\- I only deal with myself, the market, and a few softwares.   
\- You can join like minded people to share ideas but you are being responsible for your own.   
Is my hypothesis correct and could lead me a better life balance compared to running my own biz ?

Compared with last year’s iPhone 11 line of phones, the iPhone 12 line is showing strong demand in China. The country is estimated to account for 35 to 45 per cent of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro, according to a recent report from TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi, who is known for his Apple analysis. There were between 7 million and 9 million pre-orders of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro globally during the first weekend of sales, according to Kuo.

The new iPhones have also proven to be a hot commodity on Chinese e-commerce sites. The available stock on JD.com sold out within 30 seconds after pre-orders started on October 16. And Alibaba, the parent company of the South China Morning Post, said that about 30 million users have searched for the new iPhones over the last 30 days on its Tmall marketplace. That is twice the search volume for the iPhone 11 in the same period last year.

Sales of the iPhone 12 could be aided by the fact that it is the first iPhone to support 5G after Apple skipped the feature last year. Sales of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro reached an estimated 1.7 to 2 million units globally in the first 24 hours of pre-orders. The three iPhone 11 models only saw 500,000 to 800,000 units sold in the same period after pre-orders opened in September last year, according to the report from Kuo.

## Market Notes:

We are in the home stretch of the election cycle. One full week of campaigning to go and the weekends on either side.

New jobless claims are still high. 

The market was fairly choppy yesterday but end the day higher. The trend is still down.

We continue to have elected leaders dangle the carrot of a stimulus package. But talks keep breaking down too. I'm not convinced we will get a stimulus. If we do it could be a buy the rumor sell the news situation.

Futures are up. I'll give it 15-mins after the open to see what way the market decides to more.

        First, I'm going to tell you why a short sale in a U.S. exchange-traded stock is actually a meaningful indicator of buying activity. Then we're going to demonstrate this using only data that is freely available. Finally, I'm going to invite you RETARDS to replicate our results (and extrapolate) using the same data, to which we will provide a URL.

*Why Short Is Long*

-  A short sale is the sale of a security that the seller does not own. Traditionally, short sales are associated with speculation―traders betting that a stock will go down.
-  But according to the SEC, trades marked with the seller “short” comprise about 49% of equity share volume.* In other words, about half of all selling volume in the market is short selling. Unless we actually believe that half of market volume is speculative short selling, this demands an explanation.
-  To understand, you need to know how market-makers (MMs) do business. Traditionally, market-makers make their money by “quoting a spread.” This means placing a bid at, say, $19.95, and an offer at $20.00. Since the MMs have no position in the stock, the offer at $20.00 is necessarily entered as a short sale―they don't own it, so they can't actually sell it.
-  Now imagine the common scenario where one investor sells to the MM at $19.95 and another buys from the MM at $20.00. Knowing that MMs place short sales at the offer, we know that only one of these trades will be reported as “short”―the one where the investor is buying stock at $20.00.


      •. This means that whenever a market-maker fills an investor's buy order, the MM is facilitating the trade by shorting shares. Thus, *short volume* is actually representative of investor *buying volume*, and *non-short volume* is representative of investor selling volume. It's no coincidence that short volume is predictably *half* of total volume―*short sales* represent the *buying half of the market*, and long *(non-short) sales* represent the *selling half*.
Maybe you don't find this convincing. What about those speculative short sellers? Don't they throw the number off? (No. That volume is tiny.) What about passive sell orders from traders who aren't market-makers? Wouldn't their sales show up as not short? (Yes. But they'll still be selling to a MM, so we would correctly interpret them as sales.) 




*The U.S. equities market is infamous for its complexity―how can I make such sweeping assertions?*
      -Granted, it does seem that the market is too multifaceted, and opaque, for short volume to simply equate to investor buying volume, but there's a practical reason that today's market is more transparent than you might imagine. In a word, *rebates*. Here's the story.

-    Back in 1997, when the U.S. market's tightest spread was 12.5 cents,* the Island ECN (an off-exchange trading venue for NASDAQ stocks) started doing something different: They paid market-makers to do what market-makers already do―quote a spread. Whenever a trader “took” the liquidity that the MM posted at the bid or offer, that trader would pay a small fee, and most of that fee would be given, as a “rebate,” to the MM.
    As a result, Island attracted all kinds of MMs, ending up with tighter spreads, and more depth, than their competitors. Naturally, customers liked this, and within two years, Island had gone from 3% to 13% market share of NASDAQ volume. The idea caught on and other exchanges, public and private, started using the “maker-taker” model and offering rebates. 

  So spreads tightened everywhere.

  By 2005, when the SEC's Regulation NMS officially made sub-penny pricing a reality, nearly everyone had adopted the maker-taker model. By then, MMs made more money by collecting rebates than their traditional business of quoting spreads. This was a new environment. There were tiny margins, and no margin for error―only the very fastest MMs would get that rebate.
    High-frequency trading (HFT) is primarily the story of the mad scramble for these rebates. If you submit an order to buy 100 shares of XYZ at the market, you will buy those shares from an HFT market-maker. If you later submit a passive limit order to sell 100 shares of XYZ at the offer, you will sell those shares to an HFT market-maker (once someone buys 100 shares from him at a higher price elsewhere). Call it “frontrunning” if you like, but competition by MMs to garner the rebate that has actually *been a boon from the average investor.*
    
*Here's why it matters to us:*

The competition to provide liquidity guarantees that the vast majority of orders go through MMs, because with spreads at a penny or less, they can't afford to let anyone else collect those rebates. Thanks to this state of affairs, there is a *middle-man for just about every order that is executed on the market*. Lucky for us, this middle-man always leaves a trail―*he is compelled to sell short whenever he fills a buy order*.
This decades-long struggle to collect a liquidity rebate, culminating in aggressive HFT market-making, *is why short volume has become such a strong indicator of buying activity.*

*TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS*

      What we would hope to find from a test is that high short sale volume is positively correlated to intraday stock gains. Unfortunately, there is no real- time short sale reporting requirement, and so we cannot simply dig through the ticker tape to find the volume of short sales.* Luckily, we can use a proxy, and even better, it's free.

     Ever since 2010, FINRA has collected short sale volume data from their Trade Reporting Facilities (TRFs). The TRFs receive data from exclusively off- exchange, or “dark,” venues. Some of these venues are Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs), or “dark pools” and some are “internalizers.” Since our analysis doesn't need to distinguish between types of off-exchange venues, we'll refer to all data from the TRFs as “dark pool” data.

       The only thing that's “dark” about a dark pool is that there is no *pre-trade data*, i.e., there is no *visible order book* or *quoting*. The one thing that's particularly appealing about dark pools for the customer is that you can buy or sell stocks between the bid and ask prices, usually at the midpoint. This can dramatically reduce trading costs.
For a market-maker in a dark pool (don't be fooled, dark pools have MMs) this only changes one thing―midpoint trades mean spreads become even tighter (it's sub-penny). But for our purposes, this is irrelevant. The rebate is still king, and the MMs will still buy what's sold to them and short sell what's bought from them, just like they do on the lit exchange.

       With all of this In mind, the only suitability concern about using short volume data from dark pools as a proxy for the whole market is that it just isn't enough data. Fortunately, off-exchange volume accounts for about a third of all trade volume. This should be more than enough to get a picture of the correlation between short volume and intraday stock gains―if there is one.

       Our approach to test short volume is simple: First, find the average intraday return (open to close) of all exchange-listed U.S. stocks, preferreds, CEFs, ETFs, ETNs, etc., from 2010 to present. This is the baseline return. Then, break down those intraday returns according to the ratio of dark pool short volume to long (i.e., not short) volume on any given day. Naturally, we expect to see that a higher short volume―representative of buying activity―is correlated to higher intraday returns. 

*HERES WHAT WE FOUND*

      Across a universe of 11,254 securities, listed between 2010 and the present, we are able to sample a total of 12.74 million discrete days of returns. The mean intraday return of this data is 0.003%―an average gain of three thousandths of a percent from open to close.
     When we subsequently halve the data according to dark pool short volume composition, the lower quantile being 0–49% short and the upper being 50– 100% short, we find that the mean intraday return of the lower quantile is -0.0593%; the upper, 0.1184%.
While this is already supportive of our hypothesis, we can see much more detail when we average returns by percent, dividing the data into 101 parts, 0 to 100%. In the following figure, intraday returns are plotted by their respective dark pool short volume percentages (blue) alongside data frequency (green). 
Especially if we focus on the part of the figure where data is most abundant (and thus the section of data that is most relevant), starting around 20% and ending at 60%, we see a nearly linear relationship between short volume and intraday returns.
     Outside of this band of data, we encounter what could mostly be characterized as “unusual” volume composition. Exceptionally low short volume will often be linked to days with large block trades between two parties with no market-making intermediary.* Exceptionally high short volume will often be linked to either large buy orders facilitated by a broker or a high volume of speculative short sales. But, a few outliers aside, we expect that our thesis is correct.

*EXTRAPOLATING*

Naturally, I view this market phenomenon with more than academic interest, and I expect that readers are similarly interested in practical applications. To that end, adventurous souls can retrieve the short volume data used in this analysis directly from FINRA. The data is, of course, provided without warranty, and requires some wrangling. For advice or assistance in replicating the data I've used here, message me. My research suggests that there is, at least, longer-term predictive value in short volume data when aggregated. The Dark IndexTM (DIXTM) has chronicled, in dollar-weighted terms, dark pool short volume across all components of the S&amp;P 500 since 2011. Because the index is dollar- weighted, volume is multiplied by share value, giving more weight to larger and more frequently traded stocks.
Very high relative percentages (≥45%) of dollar-weighted short volume are associated with mean 60-market-day returns of 5.3%, as compared to 2.8% across the whole dataset.
    Since DIX tends to rise into corrections, we are left to believe that it reflects a broad willingness of investors to accumulate S&amp;P 500 component stocks at lowered valuations, and that high levels of short volume correspond to positive medium-to-long term investor outlooks. This has certainly been reflected in the data.

*IN CONCLUSION*

It is unfortunate that we only have 10 years of data to perform these tests, but the SEC has been reluctant to make more, or more detailed, data available. Among cost feasibility concerns, the SEC worries that providing too much data to the public may facilitate strategies disruptive to liquidity providers (MMs).

Furthermore, they go on to say that:

*Market participants, including issuers and investors, do not appear to widely monitor or use this data, and data vendors informed the Division [of Economic and Risk Analysis] that they had not created products utilizing this data. The Division is unaware of the transaction- level data being widely used by any group other than academics.*

Given what I see as potentially valuable information, this may come as a surprise. How can this data have been overlooked? (Academics don't count.) Our suspicion is that the explanation is simple: The conceptual link between short sales and investor buying activity―the key to understanding what “short volume” really means―has never been clearly drawn before.

And so, armed with this fresh understanding, we hope that the reader might feel compelled to explore this new avenue of market data. And perhaps to be more receptive, generally, to the value of unconventional methods and information both in the investing process and process of internalizing any information in life.

*WRITER'S NOTES;*

     I kept this as simple as my original piece. I can link my official write ups and further data sets in personal DMs if my time is worth it, naturally. I'll be responsive to questions and the likes.
    This research started as a paper for one of my financial analytics classes, to a personal interest for obvious reasons. Using dark pool scanners, and some big math, I've been able to catch many, many, many of the large moves. The past 3 weeks, there have been 11 separate occasions where price movement reflected a 300%+ gain intraday on apple, and 600%+ on amazon, only. It's easier to catch big volume highly traded stock; however, stock like amazon and tesla and apple are easy to trace if you know the math and ALSO have a macro perspective i.e catalysts and important news.

Stocks traded choppily once again, going to the red in the morning before recovering throughout the rest of the day. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments from Washington regarding stimulus, a better-than-expected unemployment report, and third-quarter corporate earnings. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) underperformed today, finishing the day even. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.56% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.62% up.

House Speaker Pelosi once again expressed optimism that an additional round of fiscal could be passed before the November 3 election, even as disagreements on key provisions remain in the White House. Pelosi said, “We’re just about there. The president wants a bull. That’s part of the opportunity we have. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were scheduled to speak on Thursday to discuss the deal, and the White House’s last public offer stood at around $1.88 trillion for a stimulus proposal, versus the $2.2 trillion plan put forth by House Democrats.

However, the proximity of the election and the lack of support for a bill in the GOP have market participants increasingly doubtful that a bill will be passed, fueling further volatility and uncertainty in the market.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday it has invested $100 million in opening new warehouses in Mexico, including its first shipping centers outside the populous capital area, in a bid to offer faster deliveries.

Amazon is also striving to make inroads in Brazil, where it recently opened its fifth and biggest fulfillment center in the country, with 100,000 square meters (1,076,391 sq ft).

In both countries, which are the biggest economies in Latin America, Amazon is vying with local rivals for shopper loyalty, despite its ranking as the world’s biggest online retailer.

Amazon kept investing into Brazil and Mexico to grow the prime memberships internationally.

## Market Notes:

No one is counting on a stimulus package anymore. The headlines can keep saying otherwise but it's not a realistic possibility before the election.

The election is now less than two weeks away. A decent percentage of the nation has already voted.

People are starting to reduce exposure to the market. Positions are being sold. The Fed is still a buyer, don't be surprised if the dip gets bought back up.

Short list today. The trend is down. Futures are lower. I'm bearish.

## Watchlist:

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have held QBTC.U for nearly 2 months, at my own mistake of failing to do my due diligence, and have learned a few things I'd like to share:

1) Do not expect price action to move in exact correlation to real Bitcoin. For example, if Bitcoin goes up 5% in a day, do not expect QBTC.U to go up 5%, as well. More often than not, it will usually go up a fraction of what Bitcoin goes up.

2) Volume on QBTC.U is terribly low. Many a time, when Bitcoin has gone up, QBTC.U has actually gone down, or remained the same.

3) Most importantly, you should know there is a significant cost associated with buying QBTC.U which is charged to you through ""decay"". This is not disclosed by them. So, the longer you hold QBTC.U, the longer you are paying their fund through decay.

To illustrate an example of how ""decay"" affects you, it would be as follows; let us say that on a day where Bitcoin costs $10,000 CAD, you purchase QBTC.U at a share price of $10 CAD/share. Then, say that the price of Bitcoin falls to $5,000 CAD, which should \*loosely\* mean QBTC.U falls to a share price of $5 CAD/share. So, you end up deciding to hold QBTC.U until Bitcoin goes back up to $10,000 CAD, to break even. Well, when Bitcoin goes back up to $10,000 CAD, QBTC.U should go back up to $10 CAD/share, too, right? Wrong. Your QBTC.U shares will only go up to $8 or $9 CAD/share, which means you now have to wait until Bitcoin goes to $11,000 or $12,000 CAD, just so that you can break even at $10 CAD/share.

4) Lastly, it's worth being skeptical of QBTC.U, as I'm personally not inspired with any confidence in its integrity. As far as I'm concerned, they can just disappear from the market any day and all your money would be gone.

Long story short, if you're interested in investing/trading Bitcoin, then just buy real Bitcoin. I hope this helps some people.

Stocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi’s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is “optimistic” about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.

Despite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell’s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump’s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.

In other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans’ attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in “all-or-nothing obstruction” as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she “has a prospect for an agreement” with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. “There will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent — my goal — or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.” It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.

SPY / SPY Futures

Starting from the higher 1D timeframe we can see that price action has been finding support right on the 1D 21 (yellow line).  The last 3 candles all have touched the 1D 21 and bounced showing major support here. Additionally we can see that 4 out of the last 6 candles have major upside wicks showing some major sell pessure.  So there is definitely a bit of a war going on at the moment. 1D momentum oscillator's are also in a bearish posture. 

1D chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/tDxBmexd/

On the 4 hour chart we can see major buying under the 4 hour 100 (teal line).  This buying has been taking place in the 341-342.50 area which we have identified as a supply zone.  In the screen shot you can see major wicks to the downside under the 4 hour 100 causing all 4 hour closes to be above this level.  The 21 and 55 EMA look likely to cross down in the next 24 hours as well.  I think its likely that price action gets up to the 4 hour 21 today and get rejected (but a break upwards would be a strong long signal.).  The 4 hour oscillator's are mid range and if anything a neutral / bearish.  Looknig at the 4 hour I think its likely we get a little bit of a bounce this morning. 

4h chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/YaSHLSll/

On the 1 hour Chart we can see there has been a lot of action around the 3439 horizontal.  On the left size of the screen shot we can see the break of this area at the beginning of october lead to a nice run.  Then in mid Ocober this horizontal acted as major support that lead to another bounce back up to 350.  Now the last few days price action has been up and dowm over the horizontal multiple times, but oveall finding support.  1 Hour roscillator's are low in the range and crossing up giving a bullish signal at least for the next few hours.   Another important thing to look for on the 1 hour timeframe is the death cross of the 55 and 200 EMA (green and purple lines).  We can see the death cross occured on the 20th and was retested yesterday the 21st and rejected.  It is very common for the area of a death cross to get tested and act as resistance.  Though it looks like we are likely to get another test of the cross area today.  Watch to see if spy breaks through this area or breaks upwards. 

1 hour chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/IfxylVan/

My ovearll thoughts are simple.  If spy is able to break back above the highs of yesterday we will likely see the 350's again.  Though if spy breaks below 342 on a daily candle we likely see a major sell off potentially back int the 320's.  The 342.50 supply zone reminds me a lot of how price action acted around 320 a few weeks ago.  And we can see that at 320 there was a ton of buying that has lead to a huge bounce.  I am getting similar vibes from this area which leads me to believe that if 342 holds we could see new ATH's.  Though if it breaks probably back down to 320's.

PayPal customers will also be able to use cryptocurrencies to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network starting in early 2021, the company said in a statement.

U.S. account holders will be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in their PayPal wallets over the coming weeks, the company said. It plans to expand to Venmo and some countries in the first half of 2021.

Futures are near flat at writing after initially surging into the green. The overall trend of the S&amp;P 500 is currently down. Headlines appear and disappear constantly about a new stimulus deal but I'm very doubtful we will see one before the election.

Rapid sell-offs keep have become the norm over the past few days. I'll be cautious about any position I take. I'm looking to lock in profits quickly if I trade at all.

In particular I'd like to look at the number of symbols in a particular index trading above their VWAP's.

I've been manually collecting data through scans on the ThinkOrSwim platform but it's a time consuming process with zero flexibility (ie: if I want to change criteria, I have to run all of the manual scans over again). 

I know people are going to say I can use Python or R, but the ideal solution would be something that doesn't require a working knowledge of database management or more complicated coding.

Stocks traded higher today, with market participants hoping that lawmakers may succeed in coming to an agreement for more stimulus in the near-term. 

Stocks lost some momentum in the last hour of market, but still ended the day higher overall. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.21%, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.38% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.35% up.

Over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a deadline for today to reach a deal with the Trump administration for an additional round of stimulus before the November election. However, in an interview today, Pelosi downplayed the importance of the deadline she had set, signaling that she is willing to keep talks going. “It isn’t that this day was a day that we would have a deal, it was a day that we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step. Hopefully by the end of the day today, we’ll know where we stand.” In other words, if a bill is to be voted on and passed before the November election, terms need to be agreed and the bill written soon.  Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama responded saying, “You never know what's going to happen around here at the last minute but it's getting to be toward the last minute and the clock keeps ticking away. I’m not optimistic about doing anything.”

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Pelosi are set to continue discussion regarding stimulus today at 3 p.m. easter time, as both officials make a push to come to an agreement very soon. Discussions between the pair have been ongoing for weeks but unfortunately very little progress seems to be made, grappling with disagreements on issues including state and local funding and liability protection, per the Wall Street Journal. Let’s hope they are able to come to a decision. 

Pres. Trump also supported the idea of a large, comprehensive stimulus package  saying “I want to do it even bigger than the Democrats. Not every Republican agrees, but they will. I want to do it even bigger, because this is money going to people who did not deserve what happened to them.""

The partnership comes as Microsoft expands into the space industry, with the company a few weeks ago unveiling a new service called Azure Orbital to connect satellites directly to the cloud.

Azure Space and the new partnership sets up Microsoft and SpaceX to compete further with Jeff Bezos’ businesses Amazon and Blue Origin, which have announced plans for similar satellite services and more.

That allows 20% upside and looks reasonable given the stock was valued at $42 in July and $52 in February.

Those valuations were before the Ohio Consumer Council asked the state's Public Utilities Commission to conduct an independent investigation of FirstEnergy, which federal authorities have tied to a $60M bribery scheme involving Ohio's former House Speaker.  In its defense $FE has asserted that it acted ethically in its actions.  

However even assuming the worst the $6bn drop in market cap seems to exceed any likely downside.

* $FE has not received any benefit from the alleged bribery (the relevant HB6 legislation does not come into effect until next year), 
* the overall impact of HB6 is not material for $FE (the stock did not move significantly when it was signed
* the $6bn drop in market cap far exceeds the total $60M bribery
* The $6bn drop in market cap far exceeds comparable cases (Exelon paid a $200M fine for bribery in Illinois in July)

All in all the valuation looks attractive with a trailing PE of 12 and forward dividend yield of 4.9%

SAP and SAGE are literally boomer companies like IBM which are kept alive because of their legacy software that's embedded in all the old companies. Most of them are technology but not software companies (NOKIA, ERICCSON) or just semiconductor manufacturers but not AMD, Nvidia or Intel. Sweden's largest 'technology' company makes computer peripherals or a music streaming app.ASML, the only EUV lithography machine makers in the world, and Adyen are the only 'new economy' stocks that are growing. They also have Prosus which is an investment holding company like Softbank but more conservative. \n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOnly Netherlands is worth investing in for European exposure. The rest of the companies are old economy companies and large healthcare/pharma are not growing as quickly and are more similar to J&amp;J in terms of growth except your dividends will get taxed too.\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Extra opinion**\n\nJapan and (Asia) Pacific are not worth investing in too, only Taiwan (TSMC, FOXCONN), South Korea (Samsung), China (BABA, TENCENT, MEITUAN, PINGAN, etc) are worth it. Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand are full of boomer economy companies too. Emerging markets are a different story but in the age of economical colonization, large companies from other countries will probably swallow them up before they can get big so you can't really participate in their growth if you invest in them."", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this &lt;a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jdpz0x/i_still_struggle_to_get_my_head_around_this_aapl/""&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about Apple being larger than the FTSE 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Most American companies already derived a large amount of money from Europe, by investing in the S&amp;amp;P 500, you are already gaining exposure to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT""&gt;Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF  (VT)&lt;/a&gt; has about 16.6% of exposure in Europe but none of them are in the top 10 holdings.

PROSUS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poland&lt;/strong&gt;: CD PROJECT SA&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many of these companies do you even know? SAP and SAGE are literally boomer companies like IBM which are kept alive because of their legacy software that&amp;#39;s embedded in all the old companies. Most of them are technology but not software companies (NOKIA, ERICCSON) or just semiconductor manufacturers but not AMD, Nvidia or Intel. Sweden&amp;#39;s largest &amp;#39;technology&amp;#39; company makes computer peripherals or a music streaming app.ASML, the only EUV lithography machine makers in the world, and Adyen are the only &amp;#39;new economy&amp;#39; stocks that are growing. They also have Prosus which is an investment holding company like Softbank but more conservative. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only Netherlands is worth investing in for European exposure. The rest of the companies are old economy companies and large healthcare/pharma are not growing as quickly and are more similar to J&amp;amp;J in terms of growth except your dividends will get taxed too.\n&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra opinion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Japan and (Asia) Pacific are not worth investing in too, only Taiwan (TSMC, FOXCONN), South Korea (Samsung), China (BABA, TENCENT, MEITUAN, PINGAN, etc) are worth it. Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand are full of boomer economy companies too. Emerging markets are a different story but in the age of economical colonization, large companies from other countries will probably swallow them up before they can get big so you can&amp;#39;t really participate in their growth if you invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'investing', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qhhq', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/investing', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1183822, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': '[Discussion] Is it worth having exposure to European companies?', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 1, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jenx9y/discussion_is_it_worth_having_exposure_to/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]"

It's earnings season! The banks kicked things off last week with mixed results. This week has a lot of big names reporting like **NFLX**, **LUV**, **TSLA** to name a few.

The election is just over two weeks away as we all look forward to seeing furniture commercials once again. 

No major news on either of those fronts right now. I'm keeping an eye on both these as the week progresses.

Futures are higher this morning the recent dip continues to get bought up. I still think new record highs are possible before the election. 

**Watchlist:**

**ENLV** is a low float, resistance at $15

**AMTX** is a low float, resistance at $4

**BGFV** is a low float, watching for a setup above $9

* Expect [""dramatic fall"" in markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/mark-mobius-on-market-reaction-to-us-elections-investing-in-tech.html) if US elections are contested warns Mark Mobius
* [Robinhood being Robinhood](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-warning-raise-cash-margin-widely-held-stocks-market2020-10-1029687430) with the announcement before the open on Thursday that there would be margin requirement changes. Smart idea but poor timing it would seem.
* **European markets**: European stocks rising this morning as hopes of US. stimulus deal and a vaccine following Nancy Pelosi statements yesterday. ,
* The FTSE also finished strong up over 1.5% on Friday, reversing previous declines with a [renewed hope on a vaccine](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/19/european-stock-futures-virus-brexit-weighs-on-sentiment.html) &amp; signs the Brexit talks might continue for a possible trade deal with the EU. It's opened strong today too up 1%.
* [China growth figures](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/16/pfizer-hopes-to-apply-for-coronavirus-vaccine-emeg/) added to the early positive moves in the European markets too
* **Forex:**  It's a day of speeches for top officials in both the UK &amp; USA. The list of speakers include Fed Clarida, Fed Harker, Bank of Englands Cunliffe &amp; ECB's President Lagarde. Their speeches could add volatility to the currency markets. The Chinese GDP rate (yoy) was [announced earlier today](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/18/economy/china-q3-gdp-intl-hnk/index.html) coming in at 4.9% adding some volatility to the major currency pairs

I hope this post helps people who are interested in Clean Energy Index Funds. I know there are specific ETFs such as TAN and FAN, but for this post, I will only focus on the main Index Funds.

One note to address before we go in is that these funds are non-diversified: when you invest in these funds, you are SOLELY investing in Clean Energy. Do not confuse this with global diversification, these funds are very focused investments 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The ETFs**

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF *(ICLN)* \- This one seems to be the most popular. It has the lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.46% and it's globally diversified. ICLN contains about 30 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 55%. This fund is 40% American and 60% Global. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and New Zealand. Basic preliminary knowledge of each country's economic/political situation can be helpful. This fund contains a ton of CORE Renewable Stock (Biofuels, Ethanol, Geothermal, Hydroelectric, Solar, Wind) but it's devoid of Tech Built On Renewables such as EVs — which seem to be the talk of the town nowadays. This fund follows the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index and it's Market-Cap Weighted. Overall, this fund focuses on the CORE components of renewable energy.

&amp;#x200B;

First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green ETF *(QCLN)* \- This one is similar to ICLN. This globally diversified fund has the second-lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.60%. If you are interested in American Renewable concentration, this may be a contender for you as QCLN is 80% US weight. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and Canada. This fund follows the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index which holds 44 stocks, of which their top 10 accounts for 54% of the whole fund. This fund is very similar to ICLN though containing a few differences. ICLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy whereas QCLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables. Tech Built On Renewables would consist of technologies such as EVs and Light-Emitting Diodes, supported by companies like TSLA, NIO, and OLED. 

&amp;#x200B;

ALPS Clean Energy ETF *(ACES)* \- This one is a little different. ACES has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.65%.  This fund is NOT globally diversified, with its only focus on Canada (20%) and the US (80%). This fund follows a unique index known as the NACEX Index (which focuses on US/Canadian Clean Energy) and it is Market-Cap Weighted. The top 10 holdings account for about 50%. This ETF is very similar to QLCN (Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables) *minus* the Global Diversification. Ultimately, this fund is a North American focused Renewable Energy Index Fund.

**Fact Sheets**

What I provided is very brief. If you're serious about clean energy, I highly recommend you read each Index Funds fact sheet along with the prospectuses. This will educate you on the field more and provide more crucial data for each fund.

The main difference between each of these funds really comes down to the underlying holdings, sector allocations, and global diversification. Analyze your Risk Tolerance and Circle Of Competence in terms of holding/sector/globality for each fund before making a decision.

I'm trading options and I realize that it's basically gambling, but I'm trying to use the principle of [expected value](https://www.randomstock.net/ExpectedValue) in order to only make winning trades.

I have to say, in my experience, selling call options is a 50% success rate. So as long as the return on investment is more than double, then you see success in the long run.

Let's say you have a hefty chunk of capital invested in a stock you trust and believe in long term. However, you've been monitoring a couple other stocks closely, daily, for over a month and you feel confident in your ability to make short term gains from those two stocks (they express higher volatility than your trusted stock). Do you: A) Take the risk, sell your ""trusted"" stock (even if it is a small capital gains loss) to buy up the other two stocks you see as a good price leading to a short term gain? or B) Leave it alone, just stay with the stock you trust and believe in with low volatility?

Q.2. When you're going in to buy a stock you want, do you wait for a desirable price or do you set up a cash covered put to buy the stock? 

Q.3. I'm currently setting aside $1,000 monthly from my paycheck into a managed portfolio through MetLife. It's moderate risk (more towards low risk). I have been trading on my own for a while now, I've gained some confidence on trading options and feel as though I could make as good as if not slightly better gains than my MetLife portfolio. Would you put that $1,000 monthly into your own self-managed brokerage portfolio or for quality-of-life (I have two little kids, a wife, a dog, a mortgage, a career I need to focus on) would you just let the money ride out in your 403b (or 401k whatever the case may be)?

“One shareholder avoided much of that drop: the CEO. On June 19, the day the stock peaked, Olsen contracted with an investment bank to hedge 150,000 shares—a quarter of his stock in the company—against losses if the price fell below 18. As part of the complex maneuver, he agreed to sell his shares to the bank one year later and got an advance of $2.2 million. Olsen, who disclosed his hedging in public filings, declined to comment for this story”. To facilitate this transaction, the banker would immediately short the stock, then buy a call to protect themselves from further appreciation. They make money by charging a fee, while also potentially attracting new customers”.

I started in July this year and learned a lot from all the amazing people in reddit. Reposting in this sub because I did not get any advice for some of my questions below, specifically question 3. After many months of following this sub (since August) and starting to understand calls, especially buying calls and selling covered calls. 

I am looking for fellow redditors to 
1-critique my position
2-pitfalls on a beginner selling covered calls (some of my stock I do not want to lose as a result of selling calls against the premium).
Eg. I have 100 XPEV and sold a 11/20 25c for $115 ( it must be natural to get greedy, given the environment around EVs) how do you all work on yourselves? For now I say to myself, have fun and see what happens I get to pick back 2500 if it gets assigned, should the share hit &gt;25

3- how do I pull in my shares from RH and Ally together? Can I transfer my shares easily?

Stocks traded mostly sideways today to end the day slightly negative as investors weighed disappointing news on the stimulus front, a challenging reopening with some places being forced to go back on partial quarantine measures, and a US election which is now less than 3 weeks away.

For the day the SPY was down 0.07%, the QQQ down 0.57%, and the DIA incredibly up 0.37%. This price action, hints to a rotation out of the high flying names and into the reopening of the economy and more industrial names.

On the COVID front, this week was difficult as cases in the US have topped 8 Million. Furthermore, two of the vaccine frontrunners, Johnson and Johnson and Eli Lilly halted their trials due to safety and quality concerns. Also the CEO of Pfizer today stated that the company would not apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine any earlier than the third week of November.

The United States Budget Deficit has increased to a record $3.1Trillion in fiscal year 2020. In comparison to last year's, it has tripled in size, mostly due to the measures put in place in response to the COVID pandemic. As a share of GDP this represents 16%, the largest since WWII, to put this into context in the 2009 crisis it reached almost 10% at its peak. The biggest chunk of spending came as federal spending jumped 47% due to increased unemployment compensation needs. Still Fed Chair Jerome Powell as soon as last week kept warning that recovery will be fragile and more so without additional aid from Congress and added that providing too much stimulus shouldn’t be a problem, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The figures for retail sales for the month of September have been reported today and they show that US retail sales have grown for the 5th month in a row driven by strong spending in clothing, cars and sporting goods, according to a report published by MarketBeat. Sales jumped 1.9% which is more than double of the consensus estimate. “Americans raced to the stores in September,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Sal Guatieri, in a note to investors, adding that they were “buying just about everything in sight, especially clothing.”

In Europe things have been shaky as the U.K. faces resurgence in COVID cases, and a bumpy BREXIT negotiation. Partial quarantine measures have been put back in place, and negotiations between the U.K. and European Union will continue next week. Boris Johnson has told Bloomberg that he believes a deal is unlikely.

Highlights

* A new plan was unveiled today to get COVID shots to nursing homes, even though such a vaccine does not yet exist. This led to skepticism from experts. Under the program, trained staff from CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA) would deliver the vaccines and administer the shots.

* Netflix (NFLX) had a price target raise by UBS Group and Morgan Stanley from $575 to $670 at BUY, and $600 to $630 at OVERWEIGHT.
* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) with another price target raise, this time by Mizuho from $127 to $152 at BUY. We like this one.
* ON Semiconductors (ON) had a price target raise by Mizuho from $25 to $30at BUY. We like this one.

After the video-streaming giant raised monthly prices in Canada to $15 from $14 in October for standard HD service, and to $19 from $17 for premium HD service, the speculation immediately turned to when we might expect the same in the U.S. Adding to the intrigue, Netflix has quietly eliminated its free trials, requiring a paid plan to gain access to its streaming service. The company’s help center page now says free trials “are not available.”

“The Canadian price increase supports our view that broader price hikes are probable in the near-term,” Jefferies analyst Alex Giaimo said in an Oct. 8 note that reiterated a Buy rating and price target of $570, and estimated that Canada, with about 7 million subscriptions, accounts for 4% of Netflix’s user base worldwide . “[Netflix] typically adjusts pricing every 2-3 years.”

The conglomerate is set to provide an update on its stake in a regulatory filing in mid-November.

“Clearly Warren Buffett has less confidence in the future course at Wells Fargo, in the perhaps future expected performance of its stock,” David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, said in an interview. “He may perceive that there’s a lot more risk than he originally foresaw.”

Twitter is capping off a [tough week](https://taylorhoffman.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=abfd6114e6972955bfd6f87f4&amp;id=908650ac33&amp;e=0a139504b4) for them with [another gaffe](https://taylorhoffman.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=abfd6114e6972955bfd6f87f4&amp;id=9642cef31e&amp;e=0a139504b4). For multiple hours Thursday, Twitter users were greeted with an error message as the app could not function. Twitter released a statement claiming an inadvertent change to its internal systems caused the error.

**Why does this Matter?**  
Twitter, Facebook, and other tech-giants have been in the crosshairs of legislators and users this week. As the United States approaches election season and political tensions run high, the question of how social media platforms should react to new information and its validity is back in the public eye. With users already upset over censorship claims, a widespread outage compounds the harm to the firm.

Investors and executives alike have reason to be concerned should Twitter and other social media giants not clarify what their role is in the process of validating information. Legislator involvement would certainly not bode well for Alphabet, Twitter, Facebook, and others. In fact, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has already been subpoenaed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The potential externalities of legislative involvement in the space may cause unforeseen headwinds in the space.

Robinhood is receiving major backlash for sub-par customer support along with a massive data breach leaving thousands out to dry. Should they be forced to change? Is this a risk investors take by using a low-price, zero-fee platform?

**Why does this Matter?**  
Robinhood Markets has over 13 million users worldwide. Horror stories of compromised accounts have surfaced in recent days. In particular, Robinhood’s lack of an emergency hotline (or any phone number for that matter) has garnered intense criticism. Some users claimed to have noticed or had been notified of a breach for *days* before hearing back from Robinhood.

So far, Robinhood has attempted to address the issue by sending a push notification to their users, insisting they implement two-factor authentication for entry. However, some users claim this isn’t enough, and there are a handful of anecdotes claiming accounts have been compromised despite two-factor authentication.

What should Robinhood do? Surely consumers will leave given the app’s insecurity, but as [seen here](https://taylorhoffman.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=abfd6114e6972955bfd6f87f4&amp;id=6ae6030c6b&amp;e=0a139504b4), leaving a brokerage can take weeks or even months depending on transfer fees or whether or not you want to sell your current holdings. For certain, it feels as if Robinhood has a responsibility to its users to provide live support in the event of a crisis.

**The Takeaway:**  
Robinhood users have long been fed up with the lack of customer support from the brokerage. However, as the tales compile and data breaches become more complex, it appears the time has come for the firm to take action or lose users.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,544134,public,confidence,self,Robinhood Data Breach Impacts Thousands,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jcb2ty/robinhood_data_breach_impacts_thousands/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company, started by William Li Bin in 2014, delivered 3,226 of its ES6 sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) in September, a year-on-year increase of 87 per cent, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). In August, its sales rose 58 per cent, with the company selling 2,840 ES6s.

Tesla, on the other hand, led the sector by quite a distance last month, by a margin of 8,103, having delivered 11,329 of the Model 3 cars built at its Shanghai-based Gigafactory 3. In June, however, the gap between Tesla and Nio was wider, at 12,478, with 14,954 Model 3s sold and 2,476 ES6s delivered.

China is on a faster recovery and the ev market there is big, so nio is definitely following the trend and capturing the ev market. It slowly catching up with tesla and producing affordable ev.

Hims has around 250k customer subscriptions. Out of the revenue that Hims generates, 91% is recurring revenue. That is very powerful. That increases LTV for customers. Around 83% of its revenues come from prescriptions. And most of its revenue comes from sexual health, around 57%.

Hims also has strong unit economics. Their LTV, lifetime value is 3 times the CAC, customer acquisition cost. Their CAC has been going down over time, and their revenue per customer has increased for newer cohorts as you can see in this graph.

As of 10am on Friday, over 1.5 million people had made reservations to buy iPhone 12 handsets from the official Apple store on JD.com, a major e-commerce site in China. The standard iPhone 12 had over 737,000 user bookings, while the iPhone 12 Pro had 390,000, according to company information.

“Apple’s strategy [with the four new handsets] is to expand a new user base through a broader range of price offerings,” said Eric Tseng, chief executive of Taiwan-based semiconductor research firm Isaiah Capital &amp; Research. He thinks Apple could take 15 to 20 per cent of smartphone market share away from Huawei in 2021 if the Chinese firm remains under heavy US pressure.

The dip got bought yesterday. It was a textbook gap and fill. The market opened way down but managed to recover most of those losses closing the day near flat.

It's now Friday and we are headed into the weekend with the election well underway in several states as early voting has begun. Futures are choppy ahead of the open.

As long as we hold above yesterday's low I believe this dip will get bought right back up and we could still see record highs before the election results are tallied. I'm bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

Retail trading platform Robinhood warned users late on Thursday to raise their cash reserves on ""several widely-held stocks,"" hours before market open.

The company, which has spearheaded commission-free stock and ETF trading, said it would increase the margin maintenance requirements for those stocks affected by election volatility. It maintains the move would help protect customers from increased election volatility.

Packy McCormick, a day trader, **posted the warning in a tweet** at 9:42 p.m. ET on Thursday, minutes after receiving it. Regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange starts at 9:30 a.m. ET.

Other users blasted the move, with [**one**](https://twitter.com/Nobel_Zobel/status/1316930116837146624) even saying ""I'm not sure how this could be legal.""

Investing on margins means that traders can borrow money as loans from Robinhood to buy stocks and options, making it possible to boost investment gains. Margin maintenance, meanwhile, is the minimum amount required to be held in the account to avoid stumbling blocks with Robinhood.

""If you hold any of the affected stocks on margin, your buying power may decrease or your account may be in a deficit after these changes go into effect,"" the warning read.

Users will be issued a ""**margin call**"" if they fall short of the required minimum and don't deposit additional funds to increase their account value by the end of the trading day on October 16.

""If you do not resolve the margin call, we may need to sell off some or all of your stock to cover the call,"" it said.

It is common practice on futures exchanges for margin requirements to increase as market volatility rises, because of the greater potential for traders to rack up losses that they cannot then afford to cover.

Stock market volatility rose earlier this year to its highest since the extremes witnessed during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, as investors around the world dumped equities to hold cash, government bonds, and even gold.

The warning was issued on the same day that Bloomberg reported **hackers gained access to ""almost 2,000""** trading accounts on Robinhood's platform.

This week, the company sent a push notification through its app prompting customers to start using  two-factor authentication. Security ""is a top priority and something we take very seriously,"" a spokesperson told Business Insider.

The trading platform has seen its popularity explode recently, with COVID-19 only fuelling its prominence, given the boom in retail trading thanks in part to the volatility across markets from uncertainty over coronavirus. Lockdowns earlier this year that halted most professional sporting activity, for example, encouraged many amateur investors to try day-trading.

Stocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election

The Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. 

The Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week’s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.

After Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.

Market participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180° turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that “getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details”. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, “I would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.” Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery.

I've only recently started buying stocks, and was told in order to calculate dividends, you move the decimal point in the dividend yield number two places to the left and multiply by the current stock price. This gives you your yearly dividends from one share. Divide that by 4 and you get what your quarterly dividend payments should be.

The dividend yield for the stock I own is 52.50, I have 72 shares, and the current stock price is $2.77.

0.5250 x 2.77 = 1.45425

Divide by 4 = 0.3635625

multiply by 72 = 26.1765

Upside or downside. 

Mine:


1. Square ($SQ) is going to be a $1 trillion dollar company in my lifetime. I am honestly amazed how well this company is positioning themselves. They will move away from small business as they slowly replace the wallet and cash of the US. Similar things have already happened in Sweden, world leader in digital payments. Square is doing the same but in the US, while being the best trusted bitcoin handler and small business backend.

2. Paypal ($PYPL) is slowly moving themselves into e commerce in a way they haven't before. They are light years ahead of anyone in ease of payment, and is rapidly spreading into a global power. If your country has a population, it takes PayPal for online purchases. On top of it, Venmo is the only threat to Squares cash app, so why not own both. 

3. Facebook ($FB) is going to be one of the solid heavy weights of the next 10 years, where some people vocally hate on them while they are raking in money hands over fists from the entire world. They have shown an almost disgusting ability of killing completion, and wouldn't be hurt much from a potential breakup (which I personally doubt will happen. Future post). Additionally, they just had a massive blow out success in VR, releasing the quest 2 incredibly successfully. VR will be mainstream and Facebook WILL be the king of it. 

:) 

As you may notice from my picks, I am betting on the death of cash. And I really really do. No price targets as I plan holding these forever. My models to suggest overpriced fairly, but I belive their growth will accelerate as new services/monitazationa are released.

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.
