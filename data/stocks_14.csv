I started investing about a year ago, while i’d like to think i somewhat know what i’m doing, would like to hear what you folks think about when to sell a stock. If you invest in a stock/company, do you sell when the price reaches a target price you had in mind ? Or after a period of time ? Or when the narrative/business strategy changes to something you don’t think is sustainable/competitive ? 

When i first started, i bought apple at 190 last summer, watched it creep up to 233 where i debated whether i should sell or not, decided to hold for another couple of years since i loved the company, then watched it tank to the 140’s, i didn’t really consider selling at a loss, and it evidently went back up to 203 as of today. However in hindsight i wish i would’ve sold at 233 with a healthy ~20% gain.

Now i’m in a similar situation with facebook, bought the stock a month ago at 167, now the stock is around 198 and creeping up, at 18% gain in a month, would you sell and bag the profits and hope for a dip in the stock to buy again or just hold for a few years ?

I know i’m not one of the luck 0.01% that can time the market, and don’t mind holding fb for another 3-5 years, but i’d be lying if i wasn’t tempted to sell at 20% gain if it creeps up some more to the 200’s.

&amp;#x200B;

What play would you make?

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at SPY LEAPS - if SPY is for sure going to hit $200 sometime in the next 3 years, pretty much all the strikes are going to reward you with a 250-300% ish return.  I was actually surprised when I looked into this and found how similar all the payouts are.  You'd think that buying a $230ish strike, would net you a way greater return if it went to $200, than buying a $290 strike on a 3 year LEAP would but it doesn't look that way. (perhaps im wrong here, and not accounting for the change in extrinsic value on options as the further OTM puts get closer to their strikes?).

&amp;#x200B;

Currently for 3 year SPY LEAPS expiring December 2021:

1.) A $230 SPY put costs you $9.55. Assuming it $200 hits - that's $30 intrinsic value and $20.45 profit per contract after costs.  %314 return.

&amp;#x200B;

2.)A $290 SPY put costs you $25.79. Assuming it hits $200 -  that's $90 intrinsic value and $64.21 profit per contract after costs. %248 return.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesnt seem like THAT significant of a payoff to pick the riskier, further OTM strikes. (Again, unless im wrong about how extrinsic value changes but im not sure how to precisely calculate that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, are there simply better plays to make if the bet is that SPY will hit $200?

I was considering also making a bet with the ultra short SPY ETF SPXU - but those ETF's arent meant for long plays and it's impossible to get the timing right.  If 3 years is even the right amount.

My university has Bloomberg terminals that we can use and i did a FCFE calculation of the stock. Here what i gathered. (keep in mind this is not perfect and want to see if what others thought)

Things to know: 
Beta - 1.37 
rf = 2.02% 
rm (S&amp;P 500) = 18.25% 

our required return would then be Ke = rf + b ( rm - rf) this gives us 24.255%

Bloomberg estimates of growth rates: 
*2018 (actual) = 30% 
*2019 (estimate) = 18.1% 
*2020 (estimate) = 17.7%
*FCFE (reported by Bloomberg) = 11,714

Now here's the cash flow construction: growth FCFEt Discounted by Ke 
*2018: 0.3 -- 15,228.2 -- 12,255.6 
*2019: 0.181 -- 17,984.042 -- 11,648.519 
*2020: 0.177 -- 21,167.76144 --

FCFE3/K-g = 21,167.76144/0.24255-0.177 = 322,925.4225 

Discount this by Ke (last period) = 322,925.4225 / 1.242553 = 16,8329.65 

We now add all the discounts together: 
12,255.6 + 11,648.519 + 16,8329.65 = 192,233.7673 

This is our Equity Value Now i divided it by shares outstanding which was 432.34 that gave me a intrinsic value of $390.48/share

My university has Bloomberg terminals that we can use and i did a FCFE calculation of the stock. Here what i gathered. (keep in mind this is not perfect and want to see if what others thought) 

Things to know: 
Beta - 1.37 
rf = 2.02% 
rm (S&amp;P 500) = 18.25% 
our required return would then be Ke = rf + b ( rm - rf) 
this gives us 24.255% 

Bloomberg estimates of growth rates: 
2018 (actual) = 30% 
2019 (estimate) = 18.1% 
2020 (estimate) = 17.7%  
FCFE (reported by Bloomberg) = 11,714

Now here's the cash flow construction:

                                                   FCFE3/K-g = 21,167.76144/0.24255-0.177
                                                                   = 322,925.4225 
                                                   Discount this by Ke (last period) 
                                                        = 322,925.4225 / 1.24255^3
                                                        = 16,8329.65
We now add all the discounts together: 
12,255.6 + 11,648.519 + 16,8329.65 = 192,233.7673 
This is our Equity Value 
Now i divided it by shares outstanding which was 432.34 
that gave me a intrinsic value of $390.48/share

I'm aiming to hold most of these stocks long term and don't really have the desire to mess with my investments too much.

I'm in my early 20's, and have over 10k invested in the stock market thanks to leftover college funds my parents let me invest. In the beginning I put most of my money into Tesla which made me some money in the short term but I realized it was not a viable long term solution. Last year I split my holdings into 6 stocks, and put around 3k into VFIFX in my Roth IRA. My current stock holdings are as follows:

AMD 22.65%

BABA 10.15%

GOOGL 24.45%

AAPL 21.4%

NVDA 7%

TSLA 13.5%


I want to change my portfolio to be a bit more diverse and safe, and this is what I'm thinking:

* Sell GOOGL, redirect that cash into SPY.
* Hold AAPL because I think it is rather stable and will continue to grow
* Hold TSLA and AMD because I think long term these two stocks have a lot of potential. I believe in these companies.

My questions:
1.	I want to dump BABA and NVDA so I can put more cash into SPY, but I’m currently down 15% in BABA and down 38% in NVDA. Should I wait for them to rebound back up and then sell, or should I just sell now? I don’t really understand the correct mindset in these scenarios. 

2.	My goal is to end up with roughly 60-40 split of individual stocks (AAPL, AMD, TSLA) and safer investments (VFIFX &amp; SPY). I know I should split up the individual stocks more, but I’ve been told to invest in markets I know stuff about, and I pretty much only know the tech and auto industry. Is this plan good if I plan to not touch my portfolio much and just let time do it’s job?

3.	I know the S&amp;P 500 just hit a record high. Is now the best time to buy, or is the price inflated because of July 4th? Should I just liquidate some cash and then buy in later?",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,373324,public,,self,Advice on how to change portfolio to be safer/more long term,0,1562351691,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c8rynt/advice_on_how_to_change_portfolio_to_be_safermore/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not a house flipping initiative, providing a service allowing sellers to get their house sold quicker for a fee and then marketing those houses back out to a massive audience. Win/Win for seller, allows them to get paid quicker and not have to worry about updates/selling process/typical real estate commissions.
 
Zillow website/app is the 18th most visited website in the United States, most of those coming from mobile (easily accessible).
18th sounds good? that beats Netflix #19, Pinterest #23, Linkedin #25.
 
-Zillow is able to constantly advertise their houses first and send emails to users/notifications, as well as the constant traffic they receive.
 
-Zillow has mass amounts of data that will help them improve their system as time goes on. This will make their estimates better and can help them market houses out more efficiently. Think Netflix and how they leverage data to pick the perfect show for you!
195 Million monthly visitors
 
Traditional Real Estate market is a massive opportunity and Zillow does not need the whole pie...only a piece of it.
 
Younger generations will browse apps for homes, Zillow being the largest allows them to be ahead of the game.
 
Zillow offers currently:
Phoenix, Arizona

Accelerated revenue opportunity. Not to mention that they still make a good portion of revenue from their underlying advertisement business. Sellers can use Zillow offers to get a ballpark value for their house, even if they do not sell with Zillow...Zillow can update data and fine tune.
 
Obviously capital intensive and has its fair share of risk…but upside in my opinion is significant. Big data is important and they have mass amounts of data coming in. Look at the reports they are able to release on housing data…more detailed then what the government can even put together. The key point I like to push, is this does not need to kill of traditional real estate…I do not think it will…but it can definitely take a piece of the pie and more as time goes on.
I know there is other companies that do this, but none have the traffic/user data that Zillow will be able to leverage as time goes on.
 
It has had a nice run recently, so it may not be the ideal time to hop in..but that being said as of 6/14 it had 26million shares short, with only 2.8 million daily volume. There is definitely room for a large short squeeze if we see the positive momentum continue.
I was lucky enough to get in around 35, but I am holding strong. Might be a spot to look for a dip and buy if u were interested, but up to you! Food for thought!

I’m new here, hope this is relevant enough- if not I’ll gladly move it elsewhere.

So I’m very new to investing. I’m 18 and haven’t even started college yet, but I have a decent little amount saved up from working a part time job pretty consistently and saving well for the past two and a half years. Nothing crazy, but I’m proud of it, and am aware of its growth potential if I harness the power of time and patience. Exciting stuff!

However, I’ve run into a bit of a mental roadblock. While I’m very confident in both the long term growth prospects and stability of my portfolio (nvda, amzn, msft, fb, adbe, vlvly, v) and am excited to be taking concrete steps towards my (very) long term goal of financial prosperity, I find myself becoming increasingly fixated on short term returns, ideal portfolio diversification and equity weighting to an extent that I know contradicts my simple long term focus and reason for ever investing the first place: to have finances be something I don’t have to think about too much, yet still serves my future well.

I already deal with anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, and have found myself frequently stressing about my choices. For example, I sold my stagnant Cisco stock to be able to buy visa. I then began to stress about the fact that I’d only be able to afford one visa stock, making it about 2% of my portfolio, unless I liquidated some of the others to balance things out. I began to think, if i’m going to invest confidently, might as well have my numbers reflect that... 2% seems pretty insignificant. But what if by redistributing, I lose the value of a good price basis on my other stocks just due to my own anxiety? and on and on my mind goes, convincing me that I’m making the wrong moves and will not achieve an ideal portfolio.

At the end of the day, I guess I understand that chasing an ideal portfolio is facile and it’s more valuable to not set a precedent of shuffling your portfolio or looking to better position yourself so frequently. Long term goals are only fulfilled from an initial period of rational choice, and then patience and waiting. And I do have confidence in my picks, diversification, etc and understand that I have a high risk tolerance, and am not facing any true threats. 

But I just remain having a lot of trouble with not opening up the app and starting my day worrying about whether I’m best positioned to achieve my goals or not. I guess my question is, am I alone or is this common at the beginning?

My ""Break Even"" price is $235.65.

This costed me $630 (3.15*200).

My understanding is that for every dollar Tesla stock rises above $235.65, I profit $200 (because I have 2 contracts). Obviously, anything below $235.65 means I lose $$.

Tesla is currently trading at $240. Shouldn't my profit, if I chose to sell, be around $870 for the 2 contracts?

When I go to RH, it says my profit so far is $36.

Is this because they don't take into account after-hour changes?

Furthermore, when attempting to sell my contracts, I get the regular ""SELL"" button, along with ""Other Options"", which leads me to a page with a bunch of price points of selling my calls, similar to when I bought them. Any explanation on how this shit works would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

In the second quarter, Tesla achieved record production of **87,048 vehicles and record deliveries of approximately 95,200 vehicles**. In addition, Tesla made significant progress streamlining our global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes, enabling cost efficiencies and improvements to our working capital position.

&amp;#x200B;

||Production|Deliveries|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Model S/X|14,517|17,650|
|Model 3|72,531|77,550|
|**Total**|**87,048**|**95,200**|

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Orders generated during the quarter exceeded our deliveries, thus we are entering Q3 with an increase in our order backlog. We believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Customer vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter were over 7,400. Due to the order-to-VIN matching process we described in our Q1 2019 Shareholder Letter, which we extended to Model S and Model X in Q2 to improve process efficiency, this metric has become less relevant. As a result, we do not plan to disclose the customer vehicles in transit metric going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&gt;Electric vehicles have been hailed as part of the answer to the climate crisis, but for some people they represent a new danger.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Pedestrians can struggle to hear quiet electric and hybrid vehicles coming, which presents a particular risk for blind and visually impaired people.  
&gt;  
&gt;But as of Monday, all new models of electric and hybrid vehicles developed and sold in the European Union must come equipped with an acoustic sound system.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Vehicles will have to produce a sound when reversing, or driving below 12 miles per hour, according to the UK government.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The sound, produced by an acoustic vehicle alert system (AVAS), will be similar to that of a standard internal combustion engine, and **drivers will be able to temporarily disable it if they want**.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The measure was passed by the European Parliament in 2014, according to a press release from the European Commission, and a five-year transitional period has now ended.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**From July 2021, the regulation will be to all new electric and hybrid vehicles registered in the bloc.**",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,372456,public,,self,EU requires carmakers to add fake engine noises to electric cars,0,1562078191,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c7tbz6/eu_requires_carmakers_to_add_fake_engine_noises/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm planning to start trading real stocks tomorrow. I've been practicing on stock simulators for the past 4 months and reading up on everything I can find. My annual return from 2~3 months of trading is +40%. 

While I have read and tried simulators, I am admittedly going in without any real world experience which is why I'm asking here for any tips or tricks you guys have. I'm open to chat about this with any real life traders here.

Anyways, stocks I'm interested in:
- AMD ($AMD)
- Shopify ($SHOP)
- Tesla ($TSLA, ask me about it, I know it's controversial)

Stocks I'm *not* interested in:
- Any cannabis stocks 

My father is giving me $200 to start off with which will hopefully give me a feel for the market. After I do get a hold of things I'm planning on investing 3k of my own cash and then building it up from there.

One last question: your opinion only, do you think $TSLA will be worth $2000 in 5 years? Why or why not? I personally think not, I will eat my words, cry, then travel back in time if that happens.

The  737 Max was expected to account for 33% of Boeings revenues over the next 5 years but, with a worsening outlook, investors 

Original expectations of getting planes back in the air have been pushed back by a second identified failure of a microprocessor that could push the nose of the plane toward the ground. Boeing expects to submit a fix in September but, even if that is sufficient, it will take months for approval and it may be that further adaptations are required.  Even once approved it will take months to clear the backlog and compensation will have to be paid.

Elsewhere Boeing faces the prospect of an expanded probe into claims of subpar work at a South Carolina factory that makes Boeing 787 Dreamliners and Boeing, with international sales accounting for over 50%, remains highly exposed to a potential trade war.

All in all its not been a good year.  Boeing’s strong balance sheet mean it should weather the problem without any major issue but the valuation looks aggressive with a TTM PE of 21. The stock price has increased about 13% this year despite all the bad news.  Over 3 years the stock price is up 170% while revenues and earnings are up 5%-10%. 

Investors are clearly expecting a quick resolution and strong bounce back in earnings even though that is looking less likely.

Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated by a push to outsource work to lower-paid contractors.

The Max software -- plagued by issues that could keep the planes grounded months longer after U.S. regulators this week revealed a new flaw -- was developed at a time Boeing was laying off experienced engineers and pressing suppliers to cut costs.

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 1st, 2019.

# **What to watch in markets for the week ahead: After G-20, focus shifts to jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/28/what-to-watch-in-markets-for-the-week-ahead-after-g-20-focus-shifts-to-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; The monthly jobs number is always important but this time, it could be even bigger news, since it may actually help tell us how much the Fed will cut interest rates this summer.
*****
&gt; The report won’t be the only bit of data the Fed will look at before it meets July 30-31, but it could show whether the economy has hit a weak enough streak in hiring that the Fed will want to act.
*****
&gt; Economists expect that 158,000 jobs were created in June, up sharply from the disappointing 75,000 in May, according to Refinitiv. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.6% and average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; “It’s going to be better than last month. Otherwise, we’ve got a problem,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis Americas. “We’re saying it’s something like 130,000. If it’s weak, the markets are going to assume the Fed’s going 50 [basis points]. If you have a number in June, like you had in May, they would go 50.”
*****
&gt; After the weekend’s G-20 headlines, the jobs report is the big focus for markets in the coming week, along with OPEC’s two-day meeting Monday and Tuesday. OPEC is widely expected to extend 1.2 million barrels a day in production cuts in a deal with Russia, and oil isn’t expected to react much, unless there’s a surprise.
*****
&gt; Markets also kick off the third quarter in the holiday-shortened Fourth of July week, after one of the best first halves in more than 20 years for stocks.
*****
&gt; The jobs report follows some other important data in the coming week, and comes as the slowing in the economy is taking a worrisome turn and beginning to hit some of the consumer-related data. A lagging indicator, the jobs data may provide some guidance on the well-being of consumers, which drive about 70% of the U.S. economy.
*****
&gt; Both consumer confidence and consumer sentiment readings in June were weaker amid concerns about trade. Consumer spending increased just 0.2% in May, leading some economists on Friday to slash their expectations for both consumption in the second quarter and second quarter economic growth. J.P. Morgan economists trimmed their second quarter GDP forecast to 1.5% from 1.9%
*****
&gt; The economy now exits the second quarter, and first half of the year, with some big doubts hanging over the outlook. That makes some of the data in the coming week, the first week of the third quarter, even more relevant. For instance, ISM manufacturing and PMI manufacturing data are released Monday. Both are important to the outlook or the manufacturing sector, which has been weak. Car sales are released Tuesday, and they will also be an important look into manufacturing and the consumer.
*****
&gt; “If the jobs number is good but let’s say the CPI and retail sales data turns out to be a lot softer, or GDP revised meaningfully down, it’s not just employment. The possibility of the Fed doing more than 25 [basis points] does not end with the employment report,” LaVorgna said.
*****
&gt; The May jobs report was an important turning point for markets, changing the minority view of some economists that the Fed could cut interest rates into a consensus expectation. But that consensus has not settled on when and how much the Fed will chop rate.
*****
&gt; The Fed signaled after its June meeting that it was leaning toward a cut, exiting its neutral posture, and that it could act soon if it had to.
*****
&gt; So the jobs report, “is important for better or worse. The market’s been bullying the Fed for the last couple of decades and if anything, it’s gotten even more powerful. If it’s weak, the market is going to push them to do more, but the Fed will be fearful of disappointing the market. They’ll also be fearful the economy is weak against the backdrop of trade uncertainty,” said LaVorgna.
*****
&gt; At this point, fed funds futures are pricing in a full quarter-point rate cut for the July meeting and a portion of a second cut. Economists mostly expect two cuts this year, whether starting in July or September, with another likely by either September or December.

# July 4th Market Returns

&gt; With the first half winding down to a close, Summer is in full swing as July 4th quickly approaches. While the days leading up to or after July 4th are usually on the quiet side with many people taking vacations, for the stock market, it is usually a relatively positive week. The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's performance during the July 4th week measuring performance from the Friday before July 4th until the Friday after. In years where July 4th falls on a Friday or Saturday, we measure the S&amp;P 500's performance in the week leading up to July 4th.

&gt; For the July 4th week, going back to 1969, the S&amp;P 500 has seen an average gain of 0.32% with positive returns 60% of the time. In the charts below, we have also included green shading in years where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half (as it is this year). In those years, returns during the July 4th week have been much better with an average gain of 0.93% and positive returns 79% of the time. In fact, the last time the S&amp;P 500 was down during the July 4th week in a year where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half was in 1986!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Week.png))**

&gt; Similar to the July 4th week, the day before July 4th has also historically been positive but not nearly to the same degree. On those days, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.04% with positive returns only slightly more than half of the time (54%). In years where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the day before July 4th is considerably better, averaging a gain of 0.17% with gains 64% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Day-Before.png))**

&gt; With people out celebrating the July 4th holiday, the hangover sets in after. As shown below, the average S&amp;P 500 change on the trading day after July 4th is a decline of 0.18% with gains only 42% of the time. In years when the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the declines aren't as bad, but at -0.12% and gains only half of the time, they aren't positive either. This year the day after July 4th will also feature the June Non-Farm Payrolls report. That will be fun!

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 6/28/19

&gt; In posts yesterday and Monday, we made note of the increasingly disappointing economic data out of the US relative to expectations so far in 2019. This week's data only added to the woes as the Citi Economic Surprise Index for the US now sits only 0.73% above its April low.

&gt; Over half of this week's releases came in worse than the prior period of estimates. The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index was the first release this week showing improvements from the April data and coming in above estimates, but the indicator is still showing contracting activity (reading below zero). The Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also was out on Monday showing far weaker results. Later in the week, on Thursday, the Kansas City Fed released their own manufacturing activity index completing our Five Fed Composite which is painting a bleak picture for the manufacturing sector. There was also a good amount of housing data this week with overall solid results including stronger than expected home prices (via the FHFA index and S&amp;P CoreLogic's Case-Shiller Index) but disappointing new home sales on Tuesday, improved MBA Mortgage Applications on Wednesday, and a much better Pending Home Sales print on Thursday. Chicago PMI dropped below 50 on Friday, which is a sign of contraction, but Michigan Confidence beat estimates. One other major release this week was the third and final release of quarterly GDP, which held steady at 3.1% QoQ but was below estimates of an increase to 3.2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-Eco1.png))**

&gt; Despite a shortened week due to the July 4th holiday, next week is set up to be a busy one. On Monday, Markit will release their final June PMI on manufacturing alongside the ISM reading later that morning. While Markit measures on manufacturing are expected to hold steady at 50.1, ISM data is anticipated to fall 1.1 down to 51. The only release Tuesday will be data on vehicle sales, which are expected to fall to 17 mm SAAR. On Thursday, there will be no releases and US markets will be shuttered in observance of the July 4th holiday. Additionally, markets will close early (1:00 PM EST) on Wednesday. In spite of this shortened session and day off, there is a huge slug of data to be released Wednesday. Following up the manufacturing PMIs, Markit and ISM non-manufacturing indicators are all due out on Wednesday. In the late morning, final May data on Factory, Durable, and Capital Goods Orders are also going to be released. Alongside the standard Wednesday release of MBA Mortgage Applications, other weekly data that is typically released on Thursday will be pushed ahead one day including Initial Jobless Claims and Bloomberg Consumer Comfort. ADP employment numbers are expected to show improvements when it releases on Wednesday ahead of Friday's Nonfarm payrolls report, which is also forecasting a solid improvement from the previous month.

# Trend Analyzer - 6/28/19 - Teetering On Overbought

&gt; After the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) set a new all-time high last Thursday, stocks have yet to make a push back above these levels as all of the major index ETFs sit below where they were at last Thursday's close. This pullback was partially a function of the large-cap major index ETFs like the Russell 1000 (IWB) working off overbought levels. Whereas all of these were overbought last week, currently only the Dow (DIA) still sits in overbought territory although other large caps are teetering on joining DIA. The Core S&amp;P Small Cap (IJR) and Micro Cap (IWC) are only lower by 0.41% and 0.33%, respectively. These are smaller losses compared to other ETFs which lost around 1%. Ironically, this outperformance also comes as IJR and IWC are now showing sideways trends rather uptrends across the rest of the ETFs. Granted, not all small-cap indices have been outperforming. Another small-cap index, the Russell 2000 (IWM), has seen performance more inline with other ETFs, declining 1.07%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-TA.png))**

&gt; Every sector except Materials (XLB) is lower over the last week. As shown in our Trend Analyzersnapshot below, it's the defensives that are finally lagging, with Real Estate (XLRE) down 4% and Utilities (XLU) down 2% since last Thursday's close. At the moment, only Materials and Health Care are overbought, while the rest are neutral.

# US Falls to the Bottom of the Pack

&gt; In a post earlier this week, we provided an update to the Citi Economic Surprise indices broken out by region. With economic data in the US continuing to disappoint this week, the Citi Surprise index (percentage of economic indicators that are beating vs. missing estimates) for the US is coming increasingly close to taking out its late April low and declining to its lowest levels in two years. What's also notable about the current reading is that at the most recent reading of -67.5, the surprise index for the US is more negative than any other country or region that this series tracks.

&gt; Below we compare the Citi surprise reading for the US and Europe over the last twelve months, and what a reversal it has been. Heading into 2019, economic data in the US was coming in much better relative to expectations versus Europe, but ever since then, data in the US has been getting progressively worse relative to expectations, while data in Europe has been consistently improving.

# July’s First Trading Day—Most Bullish Day, S&amp;P 500 has Advanced 85.7% of the Time

&gt; July’s first trading day is the best performing first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1,175.74 points since 1998. Over the past 21 years, DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.40%. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 85.7% of the time (average gain 0.42%). NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 76.2% (0.26% average gain). No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 21 years.

# Pre-Election Year July Performance Mixed

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and strength towards the end.

&gt; Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #6 for DJIA and #7 S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #8. NASDAQ has only advanced in six of the last twelve pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech’s and small-cap’s meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 0.9% and 0.3% respectively.

&gt;The European Union and the Mercosur bloc of South American countries have agreed on the draft text of a free-trade deal. Both sides have been negotiating the agreement for almost 20 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The European Union and the Mercosur bloc of four South American countries — Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay — have agreed to draft wording for a free-trade deal after almost 20 years of talks, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;He said the historic deal was ""sending a strong signal,"" calling it the ""largest trade agreement the EU has ever concluded.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Representatives from both sides have have been putting the final touches on the treaty's wording in Brussels since Wednesday. The announcement comes after 39 rounds of negotiations that began in 2000.  
&gt;  
&gt;Talks intensified after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States on a protectionist platform. That forced the EU halt talks with the US and look elsewhere to shore up trade partnerships. The EU has recently signed trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, and Japan.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Currently have 0 debt on the Amex but roughly $6k general debt on my CC’s.  


Am I dumb AF?   Possibly.  


Could this grant me some great gains?  Maybe 


If anyone wants to talk me out of it, go ahead!   I’m
Really debating whether or not to do this, but I feel the risk /// reward is decently in the favor of reward?

&amp;#x200B;

Upwork is  the largest freelance market place in the world.

\- It has the highest active number of freelancers

\- Highest active number of jobs

\- Highest revenue generating

\- I have used it and the platform from the technical side is outstanding from the job poster perspective

\- The value that the freelance market places is insane, as I am able to hire Ukrainian programmer for a fraction of the price that I would pay in European Union

\- Awesome transaction technology (quick and easy invoicing)

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I think it is undervalued:

\- It is trading 5.0x next year sales, for a high growth company which is not profit generating that is a good metric, in fact it is lower than Fiverr, which is its closest competitor at the moment. It is also lower than many other hyped startups

\- The freelancer economy is going to grow once the new generation takes over the work force. More and more people want to work on the go or want additional salary to their existing job. In my opinion people undervalue the freelance movement, there are hotels and island created for freelancers now, and it is only the beginning. Every company will be hiring at least one person on upwork in the future, because it is so much cheaper to do so as you get access to the entire world.

\- Upwork is like facebook. It is basically a monopoly and it will be getting stronger as more users join. Once articles such as ""freelancer made USD1m on upwork"" emerge more people will want to advertise there and more companies will want to post jobs

&amp;#x200B;

Risk:

\- Google or facebook creating an alternative, but to my opinion upwork is large enough to combat that. Fiverr or [Freelancer.com](https://Freelancer.com) are not good enough competitors in my opinion. They are smaller and no one wants to post on smaller gigs

&amp;#x200B;

My Conclusion

\- Valuation is too low for this company. Although its revenue growth slowed down in the recent quarter the long-term is looking great as the freelance market is going to grow massively

It is key to study the characteristics of winning trades to learn how to identify them before they happen.

&amp;#x200B;

 KL has been among the strongest stocks in June. Since the end of the short term downtrend in the indices on 6/4 , KL has taken off and made incredible returns in less than 4 weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentals:

&amp;#x200B;

* KL is among the strongest stocks based on fundamentals. I look for stocks which meet the CANSLIM criteria. I focus on Earnings reports, sales, and ROE.
* KL has extremely good EPS reports the past 4 quarters. The EPS % change also is in an accelerating pattern (for the last 4 quarters) which can drive stocks to new highs. The EPS % change reports started at a low of +58% (very high in its own right) and most recently +112% (reported on 5/7)
* KL's sales are matching the pace of the EPS, with accelerating sales the past 3 quarters
* KL's ROE is excellent at 23.6 (I look for higher than 13)

&amp;#x200B;

Technicals (Looking at Price data and technical indicators like MACD, Stochastics)

&amp;#x200B;

* Last October KL started dipping with the general market, But in Mid November, it started making its first move upward before the general market reached the bottom of its pullback. This is a sign that a stock can be a next market leader.
* Then KL advanced 90% yes 90% until it started consolidating this incredible move upwards on 2/28.
* During this most recent market pullback, KL first seemed to keep moving sideways but on 5/31 right as the market resumed its uptrend, KL started advancing even fast than during its first run up
* On 5/31, KL advanced on a spike in volume as well as a 10.4.4 stochastic cross, 12.26.9 MACD increasing and a huge jump in relative strength versus the SPY.
* Then there were 3 straight days of huge buying volume, confirming that institutions were acquiring this stock.
* Since then it has increased almost 25% and is still going strong.

&amp;#x200B;

Outlook

&amp;#x200B;

KL just moved out of its 2nd stage base. Winning Growth stocks with similar characteristics in the past such as Amazon, Apple, Netflix... built at least 5 bases during their huge moves up. This could just be the start of KL's increase. Definitely one to have on your watchlist.

&amp;#x200B;

Always do your own research and use stop loses.

Metrics to look at would be NetDebt/EBITDA, Debt/Equity and Interest Coverage ratio.\n* Many boring consumer staples have historically outperformed the market because they grow earnings reliably and tend not to be overpriced in general.\n\nBuy said companies when\n\n* They are trading at a discount compared to historic levels. Metrics to look at would be EV/EBITDA, dividend yield, FCF yield.\n* However, avoid buying companies that have heavily compromised their balance sheet. If the free cash flow barely covers the dividend, stay away. If the interest coverage ratio is in the low single digits, stay away.\n* Avoid buying overpriced stocks. Even the best companies will offer subpar returns when you overpay. KO has slightly underperformed the market because it was trading at a PE in the 50s during its peak in the late 90s.\n\nYou can get all this information from Morningstar or Value Line that most public libraries provide free access to. Or you can calculate it from the sec filings [https://www.sec.gov/](https://www.sec.gov/).\n\nKeeping this in mind will keep you from panic selling when the market sees a downturn. In fact, it’ll even help you buy excellent companies at a nice discount. **This isn't a guarantee to outperform the market, but it's a fairly straightforward approach that increases your odds of doing so**. I’m a fairly inexperienced investor, but I’m lucky enough to have the guidance of my more experienced family.

Metrics to look at would be NetDebt/EBITDA, Debt/Equity and Interest Coverage ratio.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many boring consumer staples have historically outperformed the market because they grow earnings reliably and tend not to be overpriced in general.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buy said companies when&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They are trading at a discount compared to historic levels. Metrics to look at would be EV/EBITDA, dividend yield, FCF yield.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;However, avoid buying companies that have heavily compromised their balance sheet. If the free cash flow barely covers the dividend, stay away. If the interest coverage ratio is in the low single digits, stay away.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Avoid buying overpriced stocks. Even the best companies will offer subpar returns when you overpay. KO has slightly underperformed the market because it was trading at a PE in the 50s during its peak in the late 90s.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get all this information from Morningstar or Value Line that most public libraries provide free access to.

In fact, it’ll even help you buy excellent companies at a nice discount. &lt;strong&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a guarantee to outperform the market, but it&amp;#39;s a fairly straightforward approach that increases your odds of doing so&lt;/strong&gt;.

I was reading the wiki, and I'm looking into a ""robinhood"" account. It seems like I can trade ETF's and stocks with them. Although it says ""theyre sometimes slow"", which I'm not sure what that means.

CEO, Jeff Bearden is also CEO of B&amp;D Consulting. A company specializing in cyber security, intelligence,  cloud services and more with peers such as Booz Allen Hamilton. 

The company seems to be very active in the security community. Recently there were about a dozen job postings for Synrgy Corp with salaries all over 100k. The leader engineer and lead for the EPIC application from B&amp;D Consulting is also employed by Synrgy Corp. 

With $38 billion in DoD contracts awarded to them and their hand in many levels of government and corporate partnerships, what do you think about this company and its future? Compared to its peers, is uplisting to the Nasdaq a potential?

I work in project finance management for a mid sized construction firm that does a lot of work on public buildings as well as offices, hospitals, and business store fronts. My job offers some nice insight at times with how the economy is doing, particularly the construction and real estate sectors. Since last Thursday, I have met with our bank, union reps, a few city reps, some of our larger vendors, our accountants, and our company’s financial advisor. I always enjoy meeting with these people and hearing their thoughts so I thought I’d share a little about where some professionals think things stand with the market, economy, and world in general.

Let’s start with our bank. When I saw our banker last Thursday, we both exchanged the usual questions like how’s business and what not. To my surprise, our banker said things were actually pretty slow on his end, or at least slower than he hoped and anticipated. He was in near disbelief that further rate cuts are predicted and noted how things seem to be slowing down a bit on their end. FWIW this banker is from Bank of America and is someone I’ve known for nearly a decade. Good guy who I enjoy talking with and value their opinion a lot. His general feel with the economy and market was cautiously optimistic. Things still appear pretty good overall but there is definitely some cooling off going on right now in his opinion. He stated he was recommending clients go more conservative with their portfolios and stated he was doing so himself. He also noted how the local real estate market, while still strong and hot, was finally starting to show some signs of cooling down. 

Next up was our company’s financial advisor. This guy is a really good guy but I’m always skeptical regarding some of the stuff he says. He’s just as much of a salesman as an advisor at times so I take his advice and recommendations with a grain of salt sometimes. When we spoke about the market and economy, he was pretty much bewildered. He stated he expected things to have slowed down faster and more extreme but the economy and especially stock market has mostly proven otherwise. He thought Dec. 2018 was an overreaction but that it would ultimately be the start of a slow downwards trend with the next 1-2 years being frustrating. Despite the strong start 2019 has seen, he stated his firm still believes a correction is around the corner and that his firm has been preparing for such. I got off him that he’s not expecting anything major or a nasty crash/recession but instead some increased volatility, modest corrections, and a general slowdown of things. I asked how he felt international markets since valuations were a bit on the higher side domestically and he wasn’t a fan of them. His argument was that while he recommends some exposure to international markets, he just doesn’t see a country that can come anywhere close to the US now or in the future. Every country/region has problems with some even in the midst of recessions or economic turbulence right now. There wasn’t really a region he saw that looked attractive right now. He did think small caps were an interesting play however and offered some of the better value plays right now.

After those two came our monthly union board meeting. I sit on the pension and annuity board for our union and each month we meet to discuss the pensions and annuity programs our union offers. We go over any concerns or trends we see as well as plan ahead with how these funds will be managed. This is where it gets scary and it’s pretty much the poster child for why pension programs often have so many issues. Our board members were aiming for 8% returns going forward (next 5 or so years) which to me is pretty optimistic. 8% is right around what we have averaged the last few years and that was during this bull run. We were also urged by advisors to increase our exposure to REITs from roughly 5% to 10%. We just hit 80% funded for our plans which was a big deal, although it’s a little alarming that we just managed to hit that target after a near decade bull market.

Meeting with these board members is always interesting. Many of the board members are business owners or reps from union companies within the industry. The general answer in the room was that business was still going strong, work was plentiful, manpower was short, bidding is competitive, and that there is still quite a bit of work being planned and bid on moving forward in regards to the public works projects. The general feel in the room was really optimistic and I don’t think anyone in the room expects any sort of a slowdown. One complaint was rising costs with materials, employee health insurance, and insurance/workers comp. being so expensive.

Our accountants were next. We meet every six months: a 6 month review and a year end review. Basically the accountants look over the numbers, make sure the taxes were paid, the right tax forms submitted, and offer advice and recommendations when necessary. For our business, things were okay overall. Not great but not bad either. Revenue is slightly up year over year but the difference was pretty negligible. Costs have gone up a bit, perhaps a little too much when compared to our modest revenue growth. The accountants didn’t have much to say with the economy/market, the big topic was taxes and some of the policies being talked about by many of the 2020 candidates. Internally, our company is preparing for a pretty flat year and decent year overall. 2017 was unbelievably good and 2018 was pretty rough but some of that was due to other issues. I don’t think we’ll see the explosive growth we saw in 2017 again for a while and wouldn’t be shocked if we experience only modest growth or even a bit of a pullback over the next few years.

I also had two meetings with reps from our city regarding projects we have coming up. The city is a top 25 city in terms of population size within the US. The city reps seemed pretty confident and optimistic about the state of things right now but they also didn’t go into too much detail either. A lot of work was being bid or in the planning stages. There was talk about some infrastructure plans, especially regarding public transportation but that’s something that’s always being talked about. It looked like things were going really well overall in general on this end. One thing I noticed was how some of the stuff being discussed and put out to bid was stuff that wasn’t really critical or important (probably wording this poorly). Stuff like historic cemeteries or a clubhouse in a historic park instead of things like schools, bridges, sewerage plants, or other public buildings for example. It’s not that stuff isn’t important but it almost seemed like they wanted to get it done ASAP and that now was the time to do it while things were good and strong. I imagine it’s harder to justify and getting approval to fix up the small clubhouse in the park during a recession than it is during a strong economy so makes sense. Just a weird observation I guess. Public housing centers are really hot right now, it seems like the city is building or repairing them all over the city. We’ve been doing a ton of work at navy, national guard, and army bases. The contracts are on the smaller side for these types of projects but there’s a ton of them.

For private clients, it’s incredible right now. We have seen a big jump in private clients over the past couple years. Lots of office buildings, storefronts, and condos/apartments. We’ve seen owners buy up new properties, have us do a couple hundred thousand dollars in work on a building that they then immediately sell to someone else. I can’t stress how well these condos and higher end apartment complexes are doing right now and they’re usually good money makers for us. Unfortunately it seems like no one is building or repairing lower to middle income complexes. I wouldn’t exactly call it recklessly but many of these real estate developers seem to have 100% confidence in the economy and real estate market right now, to the point where it’s pretty wild looking at it as an outsider.

Vendors are the last ones. We meet with these guys throughout the year. Sometimes it’s to negotiate contracts or deals. Other times, it’s a simple 5 minute stop in by one of their reps to see how things are. From talking with vendors, it seemed like things were all over the place. Some of them talked about business slowing down, their concerns over the tariffs/trade war talks, and how certain areas of the state were struggling while other parts were thriving. Other vendors spoke about how well things were going and how some even struggled with keeping up with demand. Equipment rentals seemed to be doing really well. Material vendors were all over the map. A lot of them seemed to have no clue where things were heading and couldn’t come to any prediction or conclusion where things were going. A few noted how the cities seem to be doing great while the suburban and rural areas seemed pretty quiet.

A lot of rambling here, I know and apologize for being all over the map. However I thought some of you guys might find it interesting and wanted to offer a look of how some things look on our end. The best way to describe things right now in our industry is cautiously optimistic. Things look good overall, with some slowing of certain metrics and parts of the economy. People are confident and weary at the same time if that makes sense. Lots of building and maintenance still going strong. The construction companies in our area are having a really tough time finding employees with many companies facing a shortage of workers, especially in some of the speciality trades. My big concern was with our banker, who seemed almost disappointed with how this year has been and like he saw something that wasn’t right but who knows, maybe he was just off that morning or having a bad day.

&gt;As public and government scrutiny of Facebook's power and influence grows, CEO Mark Zuckerberg will appear at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Wednesday to address privacy and regulation.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Facebook has faced criticism over its use and handling of users' data and private information. The Federal Trade Commission is conducting an ongoing investigation that could result in fines ranging from $3 billion to $5 billion for Facebook. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook had ""uncovered emails"" that could show Zuckerberg ""knew of problematic privacy practices"" at the company.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A number of politicians and even a Facebook cofounder have been calling for increased regulation of the company, and possibly for it to be broken up. On Monday, Nick Clegg, the company's head of global policy and communications, pushed back against the calls for a break-up of the company, urging that policymakers instead develop new regulations to prevent countries such as China and Russia from ""writing the new rules of the Internet.""

The parent company is worth about 6 billion while the shell company is worth about 15 million, which is approximately 400x less. 80% of the shares for the shell company are owned by the parent company now. My friend said it could be a great opportunity and ROI.

&amp;#x200B;

But would a company worth so much more ever actually want to do a reverse merge with a shell company of that size? My line of thinking is that if the parent merges with the shell, the public would then own 20% of the parent company, which is 1.6 billion. That would be throwing money down the drain. So, the parent company is most likely going to want to dilute its shares. How much, I'm not sure. But I'm supposing to an amount that's cheaper than what it might cost to just IPO instead?  Maybe until the public owns say less than 50 million. That'd be a 30x dilution. Though I have no idea how much an IPO would actually cost.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if the company dilutes too much, would they not have to buy back their own shares to prevent losing too much ownership? Otherwise, they'd have to restrict their dilution. It just seems very backwards to me and a waste of money. Am I missing anything or is my line of thinking correct. Have there been reverse mergers with large companies before?

The deal will be exclusive for five years.

&amp;#x200B;

NBC announced the decision to remove “The Office” in [a statement](http://www.nbcuniversal.com/press-release/%E2%80%9C-office%E2%80%9D-returns-nbcuniversal-2021) on Tuesday. The hit comedy was the [most-watched Netflix show](https://www.vox.com/2018/12/21/18139817/netflix-most-popular-shows-friends-office-greys-anatomy-parks-recreation-streaming-tv) in 2018, according to data analytics firm Jumpshot. The move bolsters the potential appeal of NBC’s ad-supported streaming service, which is set to launch in the first quarter of 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

A person familiar with the negotiations said Netflix made an offer to keep it, but the offer was rejected. Netflix was willing to pay up to $90 million a year for the rights, but NBC topped that offer and will pay $100 million. ( “The Office” was produced by Universal Television, a different division of NBCUniversal, in association with Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions.) One idea under consideration was to split the rights, with Netflix being the home for ad-free watching, and NBC’s service being the ad-supported option.

Microsoft stock will drop significantly because of its elevated valuation, according to Jefferies.

The back story. Microsoft shares (ticker: MSFT) have risen about 35% this year due to investor enthusiasm over the company’s Azure cloud-computing business and its success in selling software subscriptions such as Office 365.

In April, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings results.

What’s new. Jefferies analyst John DiFucci on Tuesday reiterated his Underperform rating for Microsoft stock, predicting weaker-than-expected profitability for its Azure cloud-computing business—and comparing it unfavorably to Amazon.com ’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services.

“Azure will probably never see the margin broadly expected due to cultural and technical factors,” DiFucci wrote. “We believe that Microsoft, the stock, is materially overvalued.”",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,369833,public,,self,"MSFT will plunge, Jefferies analyst says",0,1561561881,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c59yzl/msft_will_plunge_jefferies_analyst_says/,all_ads,6,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Cal2Z0IqxCZnZ2WSjsjxa_bY1jf9dBewgOhgO0dTlDE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Nv97ecseTi0pyDRDV7NUTZE6z_X5JF5hUFfYtBq72M8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51bc8646effbd60ebe3e013f6b25eb684cd45d19', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Nv97ecseTi0pyDRDV7NUTZE6z_X5JF5hUFfYtBq72M8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96ecff957e8c1098c0b9f8326162cbb3185e01d4', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Nv97ecseTi0pyDRDV7NUTZE6z_X5JF5hUFfYtBq72M8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce197701825916f55132562e0c75fd12bd10501e', 'width': 320}, {'height': 334, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Nv97ecseTi0pyDRDV7NUTZE6z_X5JF5hUFfYtBq72M8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d6f6cc4a54ad58000df2860edaf3da27e179eab', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 471, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Nv97ecseTi0pyDRDV7NUTZE6z_X5JF5hUFfYtBq72M8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9f5624f083335c4cad44b3a12fff33901c1f3e89', 'width': 900}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&gt;US delivery company FedEx has filed a lawsuit against the US government, arguing that it should not be required to enforce federal government export bans.  
&gt;  
&gt;The move comes after FedEx mishandled a couple of deliveries for Huawei, and failed to deliver a Huawei smartphone shipped from Britain to the United States.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;FedEx (FDX) said in a statement Monday that the US Export Administration Regulations ""violate common carriers' rights"" by making delivery companies liable for shipments that may violate US restrictions. ""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" the statement said.  
&gt;

So here are some questions. 

So if I buy a stock when do I sell? I get that I can hold it and it might increase a lot, but what I'm feeling is that there is never any ""right"" or ""wrong"" time to sell? Basically you sell and whatever happens happens. It's your call. I can hold it for my children but then I feel like it's just money in a bank. I can get it if there is an emergency or something. 

How do people actually get rich off of investments? Is there a stable method or do you have to get lucky? Does a stock just skyrocket and that's how it happens?

Do you need to have a lot of money to make a lot of money? Is it a long term or short term path?

Do I just keep buying stock of companies I want and build a portfolio like that over the years? Is that the long game? 

I have more questions but I won't bore you with those right now. These are more than enough. 

I know you've probably had these newbie questions before but I'm honestly getting quite frustrated and want to know why someone would invest. I do find it quite interesting and exciting and I'm enjoying learning but right now my mind is truly boggling.

Going '''long''' on a stock means that if the price goes up, your profits go up. 

When you buy a share, you create a contract with a stock exchange that is then stored on their internal, proprietary database: their ledger.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Bob Jones, and I own one share of $FOO, purchased at $100. I have the right to sell it to a buyer at any point in the future, at a price determined by the market."" The contract is executed instantly. It's kind of like a game:

[https://i.imgur.com/nvUgqvt.png](https://i.imgur.com/nvUgqvt.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting a stock**

Shorting a stock is the opposite going long; if the price goes down when you're short on a stock, your profits go up.

Here's how shorting works: Given a share price of $100 that you expect to drop, you can borrow $100 from a broker and promise to pay it back in the form of one share. If the price drops, you can buy a share using this borrowed money and give it to the broker. You gain the difference. 

If the price increases, you either wait for it to come back down, or you eat the losses and buy a share at the higher price using the borrowed money plus some of your own money before giving it back to the broker. You'd lose the difference.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mick Ronson, and I have borrowed $100 from you with the promise of paying you back in the form of one $FOO share, currently valued at $100. I am on the hook to eventually get my hands on a share for you at any point in the future. If the price of one $FOO share increases to $120, I will have to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy a portion of that share, and then $20 of my own money to buy the rest of the share. I will then give you the share at a personal loss of 20%. If the price of one $FOO share decreases to $80, I will be able to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy an entire share, and then keep the extra $20 for myself."" This game is similar to the first, but flipped:

[https://i.imgur.com/jS330GV.png](https://i.imgur.com/jS330GV.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Each of these instruments allow you to engage with the market through a contract that records the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Purchase Stock`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Bob Jones`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 1`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: Buying`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: Just now (manual execution)`

&amp;#x200B;

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on the direction of a stock's price. Note that ""selling"" without a share to sell is ""shorting"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Limit Orders**

The Price at time of time of contract execution doesn't have to be the current price, though. If you $FOO is currently priced at $100 and you want to go long when it hits $120 because you anticipate an upward breakout at that price, you can place a ""buy limit order"". If you want to go short when $FOO hits $120 because you anticipate a downward correction, you can place a ""sell limit order"". Even if the price of $FOO is $100, you can purchase the following contract:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Long Limit Order on Stock`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Billy Bob`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [New!]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 1`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: Buying`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD (price action) [New!]`

&amp;#x200B;

This ""smart contract"", in contrast to the first, will only execute if and when the price equals $120. It's a more nuanced game, but not all that different from the two we've seen so far:

[https://i.imgur.com/Qw1DuM5.png](https://i.imgur.com/Qw1DuM5.png)

Once the share price trips the wire of your limit, the contract is executed just like the very first game we played.

&amp;#x200B;

**Options**

An option is a slightly more complex instrument.

The simple rule is that if a share price moves away from a specific value by a specific time, you profit. 

**Going long with a call option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb beyond $120 by November 5th, you may purchase the option to ""purchase a share - or call it into your wallet - for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price increases from $100 to $200 sometime between now and November 5th, you can exercise your option to purchase the share for $120, and then immediately sell it for $80 profit. If the price never hits $120, and instead falls to a November 5th price of $40, you aren't obligated to do anything; you can opt to eat the cost of the option. Here's what the option game looks like:

[https://i.imgur.com/D76pr3n.png](https://i.imgur.com/D76pr3n.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Going short with a put option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb no higher than $120 by November 5th, you may buy the option to ""sell a share (or put it out of your wallet) for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price falls to a November 5th price of $40, you can then sell it for $120 for an $80 profit. If the price rockets up to $200, you're under no obligations and only have to eat the cost of the option.

[https://i.imgur.com/J2d0mTx.png](https://i.imgur.com/J2d0mTx.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Options and stocks are two different types of financial instruments that are traded in two different markets. The price that you pay for an option is determined by supply and demand, in the same way that the price of a share is determined by supply and demand. The supply and demand for an option is derived from the supply and demand of the underlying shares. This is why options are referred to as derivative instruments.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what an option contract looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Bob Dole`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [""strike price""]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 100 [1 contract = 100 shares]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD [See Note]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract expires: November 5th [New!]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Option price: $200 [New!]`

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Once you hold an option, you can do three things with it: You can manually exercise it at any time before the expiry; it can automatically be exercised by the broker at expiry; you can sell the contract back into the market.

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on price and time in a way that limits our losses and leverages our capital.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at an example using a real stock: Tesla. 

Let's say I have $10,000 that I would like to invest in Tesla, and I'm so confident in Tesla that I'm willing to throw it all away on a highly leveraged, optimistic bet. $TSLA is currently trading at $221. I expect it to be far above $221 by Q4 2019. Here are my games:

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 1: Going long with stocks**

* I can buy 10,000 / 221 = \~45 shares
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of about 221.50 since the ""price to play"" is simply the $5 trade commission that my broker charges me.
* Worst case is the stock tanks and I lose all $10,000.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 and I earn (400–221) \* 45 or \~$8,000.
* My max loss is $10,000, or 100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~80%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 2: Going long with options**

*It looks like the $225 December strike price will cost about $35 per share:* [*https://i.imgur.com/zrxyE9s.png*](https://i.imgur.com/zrxyE9s.png)

* I have the market power equivalent of 10,000 / 35 = \~285 shares, or just under 3 contracts. (partial contracts are not allowed, but for this example, let's suppose they are)
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of 221 + $35 option price = \~256. If the price breaks $256 between now and December, I have nothing to lose.
* Worst case is the stock tanks and I lose all $10,000.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 and I earn (400–221) \* 285 or \~$51,000
* My max loss is $10,000 - 100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~500%.

&amp;#x200B;

Options magnify my potential reward while capping my risk.

------------


- The U.S. Commerce Department has agreed to Tesla Inc’s request to waive 10 percent tariffs on imported aluminum from Japan used in the manufacture of battery cells at Tesla’s Nevada Gigafactory, government documents show.


- Tesla said U.S. manufacturers cannot “meet the alloy composition or thickness requirements. Domestic producers also cannot meet the annual volume requirement.”


- The Commerce Department said in a document dated June 5 and posted on a government website in recent days that the aluminum “is not produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality.” 


- The waiver is good for one year.

I'm 18, and decided to start investing in stocks. After a couple days of research, I decided to invest in Blizzard, Textron, and Disney. I'm investing in Blizzard because they are down right now, and in 2020, they will release Call of Duty mobile, which will up their monthly players, and also fortnite, which is the main reason for it's drop in stocks, is beginning to lose a lot of their players. I want to invest in Disney because of the Disney+, which will release in November, will greatly benefit the company, and will generate a nice profit. I ant to invest in Textron because they are tone of the companies partnering with Uber to create the flying cars, so they will generate some profit in a couple years.

I have 1,000 dollars I have saved up for a long time to invest in stocks with, and am wondering how to split it between the three. I will probably invest 450 dollars in Blizzard(10 shares), 140 dollars in Disney(1 share), and I'm not too sure about how much to invest in Textron.

I am wondering if these are all good stocks to buy right now, and if so, is the amount of money I am investing in each right?

Interestingly enough, I went out to eat and asked them if they had it. The server said no, they’re super backed up and they having issues with the FDA. Has anyone heard about this? She’s just a server, but at the same time, she’s a server. So I tried fact checking her and didn’t find anything. 

Also said they may be going bankrupt because they’re getting sued by people/companies because of the “meat” they’re selling. 


Could anyone shed some light to whether all of this is true or not?
Would you be interested in their IPO?

Tldr; Impossible Foods is definitely popular now. They’re backed up. A server told me Impossible Foods is having issues with FDA and may be going bankrupt.

I believe that this could be the peak as the last guys to the party with dropshipping all flooded in in the last several quarters and inflated metrics in the short term. Inevitably these novices will try for a couple months at most before they realize that it’s not a profitable endeavor for them. Once the paying customer numbers begin falling, look out below. The growth priced into the stock will come out very quickly.

In the 4th quarter of 2017 TUP reported negative equity.  What does that mean?

Additionally since then their equity has remained negative and mostly gotten worse.  How is something like this possible?

It seems like they are maintaining their dividend % (which had been going up for a year or so previously) but I how does this all work together with that equity?

# **What to watch in the market in the week ahead: Stocks on track for best first half in 22 years  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/what-to-watch-in-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-stocks-on-track-for-best-first-half-in-22-years.html)**
*****
&gt; The fate of U.S.-China trade talks could play out in the week ahead, and that could set the tone for markets and the economy in the second half of the year.
*****
&gt; Stocks set new highs in the past week, after the Federal Reserve signaled it was ready to cut interest rates if necessary, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said trade and the global economy are two factors the Fed is watching.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was on track, as of Friday, to score a more than 17.6% gain for the first half, which ends Friday. If it stays at that level that would be the best first half performance since 1997, when the S&amp;P was up 19.4% in the first six months.
*****
&gt; The big event in the coming week has been as anticipated for weeks, and it could sway sentiment for weeks to come. At the end of the week, the G-20 meets in Osaka Japan for meetings Friday and Saturday.
*****
&gt; ‘Could go either way’
&gt; President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to have their own dinner meeting at the G-20 next weekend, following discussions between their trade representatives. That meeting could decide how trade negotiations go forward, and whether the U.S. proceeds with another round of tariffs, this time on $300 billion in goods.
*****
&gt; “Everybody knows the Trump, Xi meeting could go either way,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “I think everyone expects a new tariff freeze. That the $300 billion won’t go into effect. The most you can hope for out of G-20 meeting is the tariffs are where they are right now, and there’s no more escalation.That also means China will not release the list of companies they won’t do business with.”
*****
&gt; Chandler said he will be looking for signaling from Trump and Xi on whether they are working on a deal that would be just on the trade topics, or bigger issues like North Korea and differences on the South China Sea.
*****
&gt; “I do think the G-20 is quite important in that there’s not question in recent months, the trade war started to really move into measures of confidence and measures of manufacturing activity,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Harris said he expects a positive message with an agreement of no further escalation, but probably not signs of significant progress. “I think the vibes coming out of it will be modestly positive,” he said.
*****
&gt; “Whether there’s an escalation to the next round of China tariffs is going to set the theme for the rest of the year. Even if tariffs on China are reversed, or partly reversed, at some point, every time there’s an escalation or temporary escalation, it’s another kind of blow to confidence,” he said.
*****
&gt; Harris said there’s the same risk as after the Trump, Xi meeting at the last G-20, where it was a positive tone but there was little progress afterwards and the markets then reacted negatively.
*****
&gt; “I think there’s been this broad increased awareness from every economist that the trade war is starting to have noticeable impact. Further escalation with China would be quite a big signal. If the Trump administration puts tariffs on all the Chinese products it roughly doubles the size of the trade war and it sends a very strong message that there are very few constraints on where [Trump] goes next,” he said.
*****
&gt; Powell and data
&gt; Besides the meeting between Trump and Xi, the market focus will be on anything that could provide clues on what the Fed or even the European Central Bank will do, after ECB President Mario Draghi last week basically promised a new era of easing. Consumer price inflation data is expected for the euro zone, and on Friday, the U.S. personal consumption expenditure data is released, including the PCE deflator, a major inflation indicator for the Fed.
*****
&gt; There are also a few Fed speakers, including Powell who speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “It’s probably going to be a big picture kind of talk about the broader challenges of the Fed,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They’re certainly going to ask questions about political influence at the Fed, and he’s going to dodge those. I think what I’m waiting for him to comment on is what it is they’re looking for to determine whether they’re going to cut in July or not.”
*****
&gt; Harris said Powell is not likely to say anything he did not reveal at his press briefing in the past week, and the big focus will be on the lead up to the weekend G-20.
*****
&gt; Falling interest rates and rising oil prices were two big factors in the market int he past week. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped briefly below 2%, a near 3-year low, as the Fed signaled its willingness to cut interest rates.
*****
&gt; “Should we get some sort of trade agreement that would be a nice pop to the [stock] market, but that could take the rate cut off the table,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the stock market will also be watching oil after its rapid run higher, and the events in the Middle East surrounding Iran. West Texas Intermediate futures were up more than 9% in the past week, to $57.43.
*****
&gt; “The old adage is every $10 increase in the price of oil takes off 20 to 25 basis points off of real GDP growth,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said stocks have had a solid run so far this year, but they may face some rocky times between now and the end of the summer. “For the rest of this ‘sell in May’ period we could be facing some challenges, headwinds. I think we’ will still end higher on the year. I think the seasonally optimistic September to November period will kick in but there will be a lot of challenges...will the Fed be cutting rates? what are the growth prospects?” he said.

# Big S&amp;P 500 Junes Drain Life from Julys

&gt; S&amp;P 500 is off to it best June performance since 1955, up 7.34% as of yesterday’s close. If yesterday was the last trading day of June, this performance would have been strong enough to push the month to 6th best going back to 1930. Looking back to late May, this performance is still impressive even though it was anticipated following May’s abysmal showing. However, such strong performance in June may not carry over into July.

&gt; Below S&amp;P 500 performance in June has been split into positive and negative tables. Each table contains July’s historical performance as well as full-year performance. Historically July has been weaker after a positive June. July averages just 0.48% after an up June compared to a gain of 2.84% after a down June. Examining the Top 20 Junes and subsequent Julys showed only a modest improvement in performance with average July gain climbing to 1.11%. However, even if July does disappoint this year, the full year is likely to still be quite fair as past positive Junes where followed by full-year gains 80% of the time with an average gain of 13.44%.

# Can Stocks Really Gain 20% This Year?

&gt; U.S. stocks could have a big year if LPL Research’s forecasts prove correct.

&gt; All year, we’ve maintained our fair value target on the S&amp;P 500 Index of 3,000, implying that we expect this bull market and economic expansion to continue. If the S&amp;P 500 closes the year at 3,000, the index will have gained 19.7% in 2019.

&gt; On the surface, that seems like a high hurdle for U.S. stocks. However, the S&amp;P 500 has already gained about 16% this year, so a rally to 3,000 isn’t far out of reach.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also hasn’t posted a 20% gain for the year since 2013, an unusually long stretch compared to history.

&gt; “It is interesting that the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t gained more than 20% in any one year for five consecutive years,” noted LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Only once since 1950 did it go more than five years in a row without gaining 20%, thus if this pattern continues we very well might get to 20% in 2019.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day “Can The S&amp;P 500 Index Really Gain 20% This Year?” shows, it is quite rare for the S&amp;P 500 to go this long without a 20% annual gain. Could the streak end in 2019? Be sure to read our Midyear Outlook 2019, which is set for release next week, for more on why this could be the case.

# Prospect of Lower Rates Lifts Gold

&gt; As widely anticipated, the Fed did not change its target rate today. Instead, the Fed set the stage for cuts possibly later this year. Overall, the market’s response was a choppy climb to a modestly higher close. A more enthusiastic move by the market may have occurred if the Fed cut rates. Gold’s reaction was more favorable, finishing the day higher by over 1%. Generally, the lower interest rates go, the more desirable gold can become as lower rates typically result in a weaker dollar.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06ee5a896971da25f3f06e3861567f44/tumblr_inline_ptd73ep0rI1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; In the above chart, gold’s monthly performance from 1975 to 2018 is displayed. Historically, October has been gold’s worst month and June is a close second. Historically, after weakness in June, gold has, on average, enjoyed solid gains in July, August and September. Some of this strength in gold is likely due to safe-haven demand during the stock market’s worst two months, August and September. Gold’s best three months, July to September, could easily be above average this year, especially if the Fed decides to cut sooner rather than later.

# Are Bulls An Endangered Species?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index closed at a new all-time high yesterday, the 5th new high so far in 2019. After May, the worst month for the S&amp;P 500 since 2010, June is up 7.3% as of 06.20.19, which would be the best June since 1955.

&gt; Much of the rally this month has been sparked by a more dovish Federal Reserve (Fed), combined with U.S.-China trade discussions potentially back on track.

&gt; What’s quite interesting about things now though, is many signs of investor sentiment are a long way from bullish. Remember, from a contrarian (or opposing) point of view, this can suggest there is still money on the sidelines.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 might be at new highs, but global fund managers and individual investors are quite underweight equities right now,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “If you are looking for a reason this rally can continue, that could be it.”

&gt; For example, the recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch June Global Fund Manager Survey (a survey of managers who oversee more than $600 billion in assets) showed the largest jump in cash since August 2011. Additionally, equity allocation was the lowest it had been since March 2009, and the equity-to-bond allocation was the lowest since May 2009. Not to mention the allocation to bonds was the highest it had been in eight years. “Money on the sidelines might sound cliché, but it really seems to be the case this time,” said Detrick. With the S&amp;P 500 hitting more all-time highs, having money in the market may make more sense (or cents!).

&gt; Individual investors are skeptical as well, as the recent American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey showed more bears than bulls for six straight weeks, the longest stretch since November 2016. Finally, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, AAII bulls have been under 30% for six consecutive weeks for the first time since January 2016.

# Broad Strength in Health Care Sector

&gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the fact that some of the ten best performing S&amp;P 500 Industries between the S&amp;P 500's highs on 4/30 and 6/20 were from the Health Care sector. It hasn't just been these four industries that have been strong in the Health Care sector either. The performance snapshot of the sector below shows just how strong the sector has been lately. While all six of the industries within the sector aren't up YTD or so far in Q2, between the S&amp;P 500's highs on 4/30 and 6/20, Health Care is the only sector where every industry within the sector has posted positive returns. Not even the industries within the Utilities sector have been this uniformly positive. The best performer of the bunch has been Health Care Technology, which is up 8% since the end of April and has extended its YTD gain to 36.8%. The worst performing industry in the sector has been Biotech which is up 2.1% since 4/30, and while that may not sound like much, it's still better than more than half of the other industries in the index.

# Best and Worst Groups Between Highs

&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 made a new high for the first time in 35 trading days yesterday, many of the characteristics of the groups driving the rally have shifted. To highlight this, in the table below we summarize the ten best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 Industries from the close on 4/30 through yesterday. During that 35 trading day stretch, 34 Industries saw positive returns while another 27 declined.

&gt; Industries that have seen the biggest gains between the two new highs are primarily defensive in nature as all but three come from sectors that are typically considered defensive (Consumer Staples, Health Care, and Real Estate). Health Care has been the real star of the show, though. Of the sector's six different industries, four of them made the top ten!

&gt; On the downside, cyclical industries have dominated the weak side. When industries like Semis, Autos, Construction &amp; Engineering, and Air Freight are lagging the market, it really illustrates the presence of economic concerns. Leading the way lower, Energy Equipment and Services declined over 10%, followed by Semiconductors which were down just under 10% after failing at resistance on Thursday for the third time in a month. These two industries are followed by two industries (Tobacco and Power and Renewable Energy) that come from sectors that are traditionally considered defensive, but they have their own specific issues to deal with.

The technology giant announced earlier this week a $1 billion commitment to help offset the San Francisco Bay Area housing shortage. It’s a noble overture. But even that sizable amount is a very small drop in a very large ocean. And it doesn’t recognize the reality that building more houses won’t fundamentally solve the Bay Area housing crisis.

In fact, this approach perpetuates the antiquated notion that when your company expands, you build additional offices, add nearby housing to support all the new workers you bring to town, and fund more mass transit. And while alleviating burdens on existing infrastructure is wise, this approach ignores the fact that most work can be done remotely in the digital age, and we can spread opportunity more broadly as a result.

Hello All,

  I've been reading and looking into DCF for finding intrinsic value.  To keep it slightly more simple I decided to use the 10yr treasury note as the discount rate (I read Buffett does as well). However, with the 10yr being so low I decided to double it and at the time of making this it was much closer to 2.5%.  The calculation of growth is for the first 5 yrs and then the next 5 to perpetuity are calculated at whatever rate you wish. I have it set at 0% for now, but 1-2% for inflation can be a safe number.

  The yellow areas are the ones you need to update.  I use Free cash flow as my metric for owner earnings.  You can of course change the growth rate and the discount rate.  I don't have it pulling in shares outstanding automatically as it seems to vary from site to site. 

  I wanted to share this for two reasons. One being I wanted to see if I am actually doing this right and not making a mistake and two, I learned a lot building this and wanted to let others use it if they found it helpful.  Just click the link and then select file -&gt; make copy and it should pull into your google spread sheets.  Please critique and let me know if there is an error in the way I created this, I am open to all ideas on how to make this nicer.

I'd link to their website but I don't want to give them any more attention than necessary. They don't even list an *address* on their website, let alone financial statements. If that isn't a red flag, then I have 1 million shares of ANDI to sell you right now for $10 each!

If you look at their stock charts, an interesting thing you'll see is that on certain days the volume is in the *millions*, like on 8/9/2010, volume = 1.12 Million shares with a share price of $0.0074, but then on the days where the stock spikes, the volume is SUPER low. For example, when the stock ""spiked"" to $119/share on 8/19/2010, the volume was **104**. Yes, that's it! It's quite easy to see that the company is manipulating trading so that all of that volume increases the price of the stock, but no regular people will ever be able to sell at those high prices and make money. 

What this basically means is that the stock is ""pumped"" up to a certain value, and then the owners most likely don't trade anything which causes the value to increase for short spikes, then they ""dump"" a few shares at the top and take the profits for themselves. The odds of your shares going through are basically a mistake/rounding-error, and thus it's obviously not a good way to try and time the market, let alone make any money. Companies like this have very little regulatory filings and they don't have to report profits, earnings, or revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been investing for a few months now with great returns (partly luck I'd say - but overall I try to find as much information about a given company before I jump in, and I'm pretty partial to not daytrading because I don't have the time and I find it too psychologically stressful.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to introduce two stocks to you guys that I found tonight while having a few beers and browsing around. I'd love to get your feedback on them and potentially burst my bubble - because as of right now I'm pretty excited about both of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first is Precipio Pathology, who offers medicines for oncology, cardiology, neurology, and inherited diseases. Precipio also provides specialized clinical and research services to biopharmaceutical companies developing targeted therapies. Precipio serves customers in the United States and has recently started selling their specialized research services abroad. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I find interesting about Precipio is that their stock is getting shorted like crazy, which garnered a response from their CEO: [https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-06-17/precipio-ceo-provides-update-letter-to-shareholders](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-06-17/precipio-ceo-provides-update-letter-to-shareholders)

As far as I can see, the fundamentals are there, and if you look at this post it seems as if their three key performance metrics are steadily increasing, despite the stock being at low for this year: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/precipio-pathology-sales-performance-metrics-141500448.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/precipio-pathology-sales-performance-metrics-141500448.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Not much info from me overall since I'm not sitting on too much, but I'd love to hear your feedback on that, hopefully from someone way more experienced than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second stock that I've found very interesting is Siyata Mobile, which is a global developer and provider of Push-to-Talk Over Cellular systems for enterprise customers, Siyata Mobile is a specialist in creating high-quality, technologically advanced mobile communication devices for global corporate workforces, fleets, homes and buildings. The company markets its vast array of cellular  boosters, legacy devices and Push-to-Talk products under the Uniden Cellular brand and has a customer base that includes cellular operators, commercial vehicle technology distributors, and fleets of all sizes throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and the Middle East. 

Siyata’s Uniden UV350 is the world’s first and only 4G/LTE dedicated in-vehicle smartphone. Already in operation with Bell Canada, the Uniden UV350 has rapidly gained commercial traction and has now received network approval from AT&amp;T and is soon launching with an additional U.S. Tier 1 operator, positioning Siyata to capture significant share in a massive $13 billion North American market that has no direct competitors in the foreseeable future.  

&amp;#x200B;

You guys can find additional information about the company here: [https://www.siyatamobile.com/siyata-mobile-launches-firstnet-ready-uniden-uv350-4g-lte-in-vehicle-device-for-public-safety/](https://www.siyatamobile.com/siyata-mobile-launches-firstnet-ready-uniden-uv350-4g-lte-in-vehicle-device-for-public-safety/)

&amp;#x200B;

and here: [https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-06-04/firstnet-is-quickly-expanding-across-the-u-s-to-assist-in-emergency-response](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-06-04/firstnet-is-quickly-expanding-across-the-u-s-to-assist-in-emergency-response)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, you've got a fairly small company that is pretty primed to capture a huge market, through partnerships with Bell (one of Canadas largest telecommunications companies) as well as AT&amp;T with an additional large player involved as well.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

MU's return on equity is 42.1% compared to AMD's 21.7%.

MU also has more cash than debt, and AMD does not.

**Starter Information**

(If you want the fast track to my conclusion, it’s at the bottom. Seriously, it's a long read, consider it.)

(If you're looking to trade this thing, it's on a slight uptrend and it's bounced between $1.60 and $3.00 pretty consistently over the past two months with a very low float. I've opened up a small position two times now where I've gotten in at 1.90 and sold out at around 2.30. Overall though most of my position is in Attis for the long term. (OTC) GERS is a solid buy if you can find shares around $0.055 and sell out at $0.08 or $0.10. I'm long GERS too. I'm not a trader so take this advice with a grain of salt.)

**Background**

Attis Industries, formerly known as Meridian Waste Solutions, is a conglomerate with businesses in the healthcare, medical waste, and environmental technology sectors. Management believes that the multi-industry structure is a key factor in their ability to create value for their shareholders and to fund developing operations. Attis Industries, $ATIS, currently sells on the NYSE at a market cap of between $7,000,000 &amp; $10,000,000, and has a total of 3,441,000 common shares outstanding.

As of 05/17/19 they are delinquent on their Q1/10-Q/2019, 10-K/2018, and Q3/10-Q/2018 filings (SEC Notice: [https://bit.ly/2XiAb43](https://bit.ly/2XiAb43)). As of 06/06/19 they have entered into the SEC appeals process to try to remain listed on the NYSE. According to this tweet [https://bit.ly/2WRA8Yo](https://bit.ly/2WRA8Yo) (06/06/19), the hearing went well, but no decision has been released yet. As of today, 06/20/19, Attis Industries still remains listed on the NYSE. Most of what you need to know about the SEC Appeals process can be found here [https://bit.ly/31HzdgR](https://bit.ly/31HzdgR).

**The Formation of Attis**

On 02/20/18, Meridian Waste Solutions ($MRDN) sold their waste management service operations to Warren Equity Partners for $90,000,000 and the remaining operations were rebranded as Attis Industries ($ATIS). The transaction eliminated $87,000,000 of debt and allowed the newly formed entity, Attis Industries, to pursue new business opportunities in higher margin industries. The remaining assets, not sold in the deal, are worth around $44,653,407 according to their most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp](https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp) Page 1) and were expected to generate $3,000,000 in pre-tax earnings, or approximately $0.15 per share according to Jeff Cosman, CEO ([https://bit.ly/2x1P1wP](https://bit.ly/2x1P1wP)). The remaining debt includes approximately $20,123,523 in current liabilities and $8,914,995 in non-current liabilities according to the same 10-Q.

Since the formation in 2018, Attis has made multiple acquisitions and formed multiple partnerships pertaining to all three of their business segments. They are listed below.

**Partnerships**

**American Science and Technology Corporation (ASTC)**

Their first partnership came on 11/10/19 and was formed with American Science and Technology Corporation (ASTC) ([https://bit.ly/2MVMijq](https://bit.ly/2MVMijq)). From this partnership, Attis gained the exclusive licensing rights to ASTC’s patented Organosolv Process Technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Attis Industries will have an exclusive commercial license to ASTC patents and a lease for the ASTC Biomass Processing Facility in Wausau, WI. ASTC’s patented technology proclaims to drive the value of Lignin up from $50 per ton to between $600 and $2000 per ton.

**Unnamed Tennessee Hospital**

Their second partnership came on 12/04/17 and was formed with an unnamed Tennessee Hospital. According to Attis, “The partnership between Attis Healthcare and the hospital will result in a profitable, highly functioning hospital laboratory that will provide improved health care for the citizens of the hospital's community. A hospital laboratory of this size can typically process, on average, upwards of 1,000 samples per month, once it is fully functioning, leading to a potential increase in revenue in excess of $5,000,000.”

**Unnamed Company Believed to be Greenshift Corporation**

Their third partnership came on 01/16/18 and was formed with an unnamed company that is believed to be Greenshift Corporation ([https://bit.ly/2IV77Gv](https://bit.ly/2IV77Gv)). With the partnership came a licensing agreement for a proprietary biofuel process technology. This technology is expected to reduce construction costs and improve profitability of ethanol by an estimated $0.40 per gallon. Just prior to the announcement of this partnership, on the exact same day, Attis was awarded a USDA $3,000,000 grant to support the commercialization of patented and patent-pending lignin conversion and refining technologies that it owns. (Grant Details: [https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgibin/starfinder/0?](http://pr.report/dPZoy7Fr)). Conclusion, biofuels may have just become $0.40 more profitable.

**New Representative Group**

Their fourth partnership came on 06/04/18 and was formed with New Representative Group ([https://bit.ly/2RqBokn](https://bit.ly/2RqBokn)). The Rep Group includes approximately 300 representatives from across the country, and it will provide toxicology and blood samples for testing in the new Attis federal lab as well as other partner labs that Attis works with throughout the U.S.

Two months after this partnership was formed, Attis obtained its CLIA Certification for its first internally developed lab ([https://bit.ly/2WTLxan](https://bit.ly/2WTLxan)). The Company expects that this federal laboratory will be testing a baseline of 3,000 toxicology samples per month by the end of 2018, which trends to approximately $600,000 per month of revenue and over $7,000,0000 for 2018. The Company also expects to add blood testing to its federal laboratory by the end of the year, which will drive additional revenue growth for the Company moving forward. By the second quarter of 2019, we expect the combined number of blood and toxicology samples in the federal lab to be between 5,000 and 8,000 per month. This means the federal lab is expected to be generating over $1,000,000 in revenue per month by mid-2019. This adds around $12,000,000 to Attis’ total revenue.

**Noveda Technologies**

Their fifth partnership came on 06/06/18 and was formed with Noveda Technologies as part of the JVCo acquisition where Attis acquired a license to use Noveda’s technologies ([https://bit.ly/2IT1R6o](https://bit.ly/2IT1R6o)). Noveda is leading the integration of emerging concepts like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to streamline resource management, while helping to decrease consumption, optimize performance, and reduce carbon footprints for customers and users world-wide. Noveda's patented monitoring solution integrates consumption and generation data to provide actionable real time intelligence for owners, operators and users, including for users across networks of production facilities.

**Jordan Forest Products**

Their sixth partnership came on 07/17/18 and was formed with Jordan Forest Products LLC ([https://bit.ly/2Y2OOFG](https://bit.ly/2Y2OOFG)). With the partnership, Attis announced the execution of a letter of intent with Jordan Forest Products, LLC (“Jordan”) to provide raw material feedstock procurement services for its recently announced biorefinery in Barnesville, Georgia. Jordan is a division of Jordan Lumber &amp; Supply Inc., one of the largest privately-owned lumber companies in the U.S.

**Gyeuongbuk Institute of Science and Technology**

The seventh partnership came on 08/09/18 and was formed with the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and technology (DIGST) ([https://bit.ly/2RoUdVd](https://bit.ly/2RoUdVd)). With the partnership, Attis gained an exclusive license agreement for DIGIST technologies. An excerpt from the press release states , ”Attis Announced the execution of a sponsored research and exclusive license agreement with Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (“DGIST”), to develop and commercialize processes that use sunlight to efficiently promote conversion of carbon dioxide (“CO2”) and water into hydrocarbon fuels compatible with the current energy infrastructure. The new agreement is intended to build on the Company’s and DGIST’s prior work, including the work of Professor Su-Il In and his team at DGIST, as recently reported in Energy and Environmental Science, a journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, in an article entitled *High-Rate Solar-light Photoconversion of CO2 to Fuel: Controllable Transformation from C1 to C2 Products*. Professor In and his team recently demonstrated CO2 photoconversion efficiencies exceeding ten times anything previously reported, achieving sunlight-to-fuel (Joule-to-Joule) photoconversion efficiencies of up to 3.3% (quantum yield 91%). Such efficiencies are an important milestone, and demonstrate that an industrial-scale sunlight-powered CO2 to hydrocarbon fuel technology is realistic to envision.”

**North Crest Medical Center of Springfield**

The eighth partnership came on 10/08/18 and was formed with North Crest Medical Center of Springfield. North Crest Medical Center is a community hospital located in Springfield, Tennessee. Attis Healthcare, a subsidiary of Attis Industries, will assist in the expansion and operation of their existing state-of-the-art hospital laboratory and provide outreach services within the community. Attis estimates that the laboratory will be able to test upwards of 1,000 specimens per month and the Company expects to generate revenue and cash flow almost immediately from this partnership.

**Unnamed Oklahoma Medical Clinic**

The ninth partnership came on 10/31/18 and was formed with an unnamed Oklahoma medical clinic ([https://bit.ly/2FlC3yu](https://bit.ly/2FlC3yu)). Attis believes the account can generate upwards of $1,000,000 in annualized revenue.

**Novozymes**

The tenth partnership came on 01/16/19 and was formed with Novozymes ([https://bit.ly/2ZxC9uF](https://bit.ly/2ZxC9uF)). Novozymes is a world leader in biotechnology for renewable fuel production. Under this newly announced relationship, Novozymes has committed to supplying the enzymes required by Attis to convert its pulp into sugar at all of its planned biorefineries.

**Iowa State University**

The eleventh partnership came on 01/24/19 and was formed with Iowa State University. The partnership called for a funded research program to develop carbon fibers for use in a wide variety of applications derived entirely or predominately from lignin produced at Attis’ planned biorefineries.

**Acquisitions**

**DTX Medical**

Their first acquisition came on 10/23/17 with the purchase of DTX Medical, LLC ([https://bit.ly/2x26JQW](https://bit.ly/2x26JQW)). DxT Medical is a national healthcare distribution partner aiming to improve patient care and provide cost-saving opportunities through innovative, compliant, comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for patients and healthcare providers. The all-stock transaction for DxT Medical was valued at $462,000 and comprised of 350,000 restricted shares of Meridian Waste Solutions valued at $1.32 per share. I was unable to find potential revenue or income estimates for this transaction.

**Welness Benefits LLC, LGMG LLC (verify Resource Group), Integrity Lab Solutions LLC**

Their second acquisition came on 11/20/17 with the purchases of WelNess Benefits LLC, 71.65% Membership Interest in LGMG LLC (Verifi Resource Group) and Integrity Lab Solutions LLC ([https://bit.ly/31KRN7R](https://bit.ly/31KRN7R)). The 71.65% interest in LGMG LLC comes from the WelNess Benefits LLC acquisition which owned the initial interest. The three acquired companies specialize in medical hospital laboratory testing and diagnostics operations. These acquisitions are said to be producing at least $1,070,000 in revenue (Page 37) with $766,141 in associated operating expenses (Page 37). All this is according to Attis’ most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp](https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp) “Page 37”). The total costs of these acquisitions are as follow: Stock Consideration $1,000,000, Warrant Consideration $896,645, Contingent Consideration $2,220,683, Total $4,117,328 (Page 35). Conclusion: Total Cost $4,117,328, Total Revenues $1,070,000, Total Operating Expenses $766,141.

**Advanced Lignin Biocomposites LLC &amp; UT Battelle LLC Partnership**

Their third acquisition came on 11/30/17 with the purchase of Advance Lignin Biocomposites LLC (Advance Lignin) ([https://bit.ly/2IrmSWI](https://bit.ly/2IrmSWI)). Advanced Lignin owns and develops lignin recovery, production and applications technology. Advanced Lignin uses its methods to more cost-effectively produce many different materials, including adhesives, renewable fuels, carbon fiber, and plastics. Advanced Lignin’s main operations generated revenues of approximately $7,000,000 to $10,000,000 and $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 of cash flows the year prior. Along with this acquisition came Advanced Lignin’s partnership with UT-Battelle LLC, the management and operating contractor for the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. On 05/29/18 Attis restructured this acquisition to reduce the associated expense and liabilities of the deal by about $1,350,000 or 50%. The estimated total cost for this acquisition is as follows: ABL Shortfall Provision $2,307,363, Shares Issued and Sold Value by ABL $1,032,000, Total Cost $3,319,363 (ALB SFP Page F-39, Shares Issued Page F-22, Document 10-K 2017 [https://bit.ly/2xpqK7b](https://bit.ly/2xpqK7b)). Take the “estimated total cost” number with a grain of salt, it’s all I was able to gather from the 10-K and I was unable to find an official number online.

**Genarex FD LCC**

Their fourth acquisition came on 05/29/18 with purchase of a 49% stake in Genarex FD LLC ([https://bit.ly/2KoKA8l](https://bit.ly/2KoKA8l)). Genarex is a technology development company focused on refining low-cost renewable feedstocks into functional biofillers. Genarex is capable of recovering about 1.1 pounds of biobased plastics additive per gallon of ethanol produced, which equates to an expected $11 million in new EBITDA from each 100 million gallon per year ethanol facility. Under applicable agreements, the Company agreed, in pertinent part, to pay an aggregate purchase price of $2,266,667, plus 8% of the EBITDA and certain material transaction proceeds of the Company’s Innovations group. An initial payment was made at closing in the form of 1,000,000 common shares and 22,600 of the Company’s Series G preferred stock. The preferred stock converts into common stock at the greater of $0.50 per share or 100% of the prevailing market price for the thirty days prior to conversion, up to a maximum of 9.9% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. The agreements require the Company to register the shares by August 31, 2018, and for all sales thereafter to be limited to the greater of $50,000 or 50,000 common shares per month, amongst other conditions. Conclusion, adds an extra approximate $10,120,000 to Attis’ EBITDA per plant.

FLUX Carbon LLC (JVCo)

The companies fifth acquisition came on 05/31/19 with the purchase of an 80% stake in FLUX Carbon LLC (JVCo) ([https://bit.ly/2Iv5SyZ](https://bit.ly/2Iv5SyZ)). JVCo is a new joint venture company between Attis Industries and Greenshift Corporation that holds the rights to an expansive portfolio of clean technologies and manages an existing engineering and licensing business. This new joint venture can be expected to initially contribute between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 to Attis’ earnings. The existing business generated approximately $7,000,000 per year in sales with gross margins of about 70% for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017. The Company agreed to pay an earn-out based purchase price with a floor of $18 million. An initial payment was paid at closing in the form of restricted shares of the Company’s stock, including 180,000 shares of the Company’s Series G preferred stock. GreenShift is required to use the first proceeds received upon sale of the shares to pay or refinance its senior secured debt.

The opportunity with Greenshift and JVCo could be huge for Attis. Greenshift is currently in legal battles over patent infringement, claiming that multiple ethanol producers have infringed on their patents. According to Attis’ press release linked above, “CleanTech and its inventors developed and commercialized a process that intercepts the flow of that final third in the plant, extracts corn oil, and returns the stream back to the host for completion of drying. The extracted oil is then most commonly sold as a feedstock for refining into biodiesel for about $0.25 per pound. CleanTech has licensed its portfolio of corn oil extraction patents to producers of about 12% of the 15 billion gallons of ethanol produced annually in the U.S. However, CleanTech estimates that upwards of 90% of the corn ethanol industry practices methods covered by CleanTech’s patents, and some of those patents are the subject of litigation which CleanTech has asserted against about 10% of the industry alleging infringing use since 2010.

On 09/05/18 Attis and Greenshift filed an appeal to overturn the initial ruling that Greenshift’s patent portfolio was unenforceable. The legal battle is still raging on. More information on the legal battle can be found at [http://greenshift-gers.blogspot.com/](http://greenshift-gers.blogspot.com/). The full appeal can be found here [https://www.greenshift.com/content/investorresources/pdf/appeal\_2018\_08\_29\_brief.pdf](https://www.greenshift.com/content/investorresources/pdf/appeal_2018_08_29_brief.pdf).

**Quality Rx Returns LLC**

The companies sixth acquisition came on 08/08/18 with the purchase of Quality Rx Returns LLC ([https://bit.ly/2WVCIBF](https://bit.ly/2WVCIBF)). Quality Rx Returns is a full-service provider of pharmaceutical reverse logistic solutions, serving pharmacies, hospitals, and healthcare providers nationwide. Attis plans to grow the Quality Rx business through its existing robust sales infrastructure, including its recently announced partnership with a new nationwide representative group. The Company’s potential network now includes the 4,749 hospitals and 45,000 long term care facilities located in the United States. In addition, the Quality Rx acquisition is expected to expand the Company’s service capability for large quantity generators and manufacturers of pharmaceutical waste by the third quarter of 2018, and enable the Company to expand its licensing to include high margin services for the return and destruction of DEA pharmaceuticals. I was unable to find the financial impacts of this acquisition.

**Custom Cable Services (Hasn’t Closed Yet, Both Parties Still Working On)**

The company’s “potential” seventh acquisition came on 09/10/18 with a purchase agreement between Attis and Custom Cable Services ([https://bit.ly/2ZCRpGN](https://bit.ly/2ZCRpGN)). The agreement is an all stock deal valued at $4.6 million. The transaction has yet to close but is still being worked on by both parties. Custom Cable Services, Inc. is a broadband network construction and maintenance firm. Over the past 5 years, CCS has generated consistent annual revenues between $10-$12 million with $1.5-$2.0 million in EBITDA. CCS has key long-term relationships with Charter and Cox Communications for multi-year projects.

**Fulton Ethanol Plant**

The company’s eighth and most recent acquisition came on 06/04/19 with the purchase of Sunoco’s 85,000,000-gallon Fulton ethanol plant ([https://bit.ly/2ESnkLh](https://bit.ly/2ESnkLh)). According to Attis, the plant is expected to produce $150,000,000 in annualized revenues and lay the foundation for their other patented technologies. With their current patent and license portfolio, they expect to have industry leading margins at this facility. They also have plans to upgrade this location from 85,000,000 gallons to 100,000,000 gallons, adding an extra $20,000,000 and pushing revenues to $170,000,000. At today’s current ethanol prices (06/19/2019), ethanol plants are averaging a profit of between $0.17 and $0.30 per gallon of ethanol produced ([https://bit.ly/2Rm3q0k](https://bit.ly/2Rm3q0k)). This means that Attis could see a bottom line of between $17,000,000 and $30,000,000 from Fulton alone. Attis also has plans to purchase two to three more facilities over then next one to three years and expand operations at Fulton to include other bioproducts such as plastics and carbon fiber. The current full specifications of this plant are as follows: 85,000,000 gallons of ethanol, 360,000,000 pounds of CO2, 455,000,000 pounds of distiller's dried grains with solubles, 18,000,000 pounds of distillers corn oil, and 4,000,000 pounds of malted grain. This plant was purchased from Sunoco for $20,000,000 and was recently appraised at a value of $57,000,000. Sunoco had a write down of $47,000,000 for the facility in their most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2Kt5ov7 Page 6](https://bit.ly/2Kt5ov7%20Page%206)) leading me to believe that the assets true value is somewhere between the $20,000,000 purchase price and the $47,000,000 write down.

**Conclusion**

So, what does this all add up to? If you play it extremely conservatively, after their most recent acquisition and excluding non-closed deals and non-guaranteed figures, Attis will have a total of $91,653,407 in total assets and a debt load of between $30,000,000 and $35,000,000. Total revenues will be between $150,000,000 and $180,000,000 by the end of 2019. From these revenues, they will have a bottom line of at least $17,000,000, possibly more.

What’s the downside? They are delinquent on their filings for some undisclosed reason and are currently wrapped up in a patent infringement case that could decide the future of Attis Innovations, Greenshift and JVCo. It is my belief that the JVCo joint venture is partly responsible for Attis’ delinquent filings. The downside of this investment could be zero for both companies. With Attis’ recent acquisition, management’s capital allocation ability, presidential policies, and the companies Healthcare revenues, I personally feel that at least Attis is here to stay.

Attis currently trades at a market cap of below $10,000,000 and I believe that the market cap should be at least equivalent to my estimated book value of around $50,000,000 at some point in the future. This figure does not include any potential growth avenues or discounted cash flow valuations. I believe the potential market cap could be much, much higher if everything goes in Attis’ favor. The downside risk is still very real so be wary and I would recommend not betting the farm on it. Good luck and happy investing, or gambling if that’s what you’re into; I don’t judge.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Technology companies have been feeling the sting of the escalating trade war between the United States and China. Now, they're trying to avoid a proposed new round of tariffs that takes aim at many American tech products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;More than half a dozen big tech companies wrote to the Trump Administration this week asking it not to hit the products they produce in China with additional tariffs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The White House has proposed a bill that would place a 25% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese goods not already subject to tariffs. The tariff would apply to a wide range of products, from live buffalo and primates to T-shirts and shoes. It would also cover laptops, video game consoles, battery cases and other products that tech companies say would increase costs for consumers or harm their abilities to make a profit.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""No one wins in a trade war, and an escalating tariff fight will inflict immense damage on American businesses, workers and consumers,"" the Association wrote.

&amp;#x200B;

I read about how spread put works, but I never had one of them expire before.

How do I make sure that my broker will not ignore my bought $292 put, and go ahead to exercise the sold $292.5 put at expiration? Let's say SPY trades at 292.25 tomorrow, what is going to happen if I let both options expire? Will my broker cancel them out for me, or I have to exercise them both and cancel them out myself?

Some years back I bought a few mutual funds.  I put equivalent amount into 5 different mutual funds and kinda forgot about them.

One of them is AIVSX.  Because of reinvested dividends the initial amount has gone up in value about 30%.  However, I noticed that reinvested dividends are added to the cost basis.  So even though the total value has gone up 30%, it actually says my total gain/loss is actually negative.

Yet if I were to sell this I would have 30% more money than I did when I put it in.

So my question is, is there a tool I can use to investigate the return on an investment that treats reinvested dividends as gains instead of cost basis?  I understand that these are taxable so that's the negative, but the ramifications are personalized based on my yearly income and may not be a big negative.

Additionally, how are these dividends treated in a ROTH IRA?",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,368058,public,,self,Help with calculating mutual fund growth,0,1561254295,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c2ykux/help_with_calculating_mutual_fund_growth/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

before 2018 dip, visa was 480, (66% annualized return so far), dip took it to 360 (46% annualized return so far)   that's a non-event to someone who just wants to let it ride until it stops paying the bills.  (similarly traded sideways from 2015 thru 2017, but was never even close to failing to hit the total annualized return of 12% since 2012, so again, non event, ignore it)

CWBHF as most of you know operates in the CBD space. They currently benefit from first mover advantage in the industry and are actually able to turn a profit. This fact alone is very rare in the marijuana industry. These facts drew me in initially, and then I saw a few articles about demand increasing further than their expectations causing them to expand farm operating just to keep up. 

On top of that they have a potential deal with Amazon coming down the pipeline and new products coming to market in 2019. They recently hired a CEO (formerly upper management at Kelloggs)  &amp; a COO because the founders are true pot guys which I think benefits the company and their future vision in a number of ways. 

YoY net income dropped last quarter, but they did see revenue growth of 66% and currently have a forward PE of 17. Their chart is less than stellar due to the IPO hype we’ve been seeing lately. 

I do think they retraced to a normalize level and could see some major gains. So far I’ve benefitted from lucky timing, but could see this as a company worth looking at going forward.

I am looking for a tool that analyzes or charts the daily pattern of a stock of my choosing over and over again. I used to day-trade Arry because it had 3 patterns mimicking IBB. Either a down day, a total up day, or most of all, a day where the stock went down around 10.30 and then recovered. I came across this pattern by watching the stock for 2 years.  


I want to speed things up and look at daily patterns of stocks, mostly stocks that are tied to larger indexes. Does anyone know where i can find a tool that perhaps overlaps the daily movement over and over again?

I am new in the world of stocks. Let’s say that you bought some stocks when a company X was  on the dip (as an example let’s say Apple). The company was on a dip last month, let’s say that someone timed the market and took a risk and bought some stocks. Let’s say that you wanna sell again and buy again if this China deal is over. This means that you are trying to time the market, given some parameters and you want to buy a stock, sell it and then buy the same stock again after some time. 
How do you usually set a target and decide when to sell? And when to buy back? Do you own stocks for a long term or do you buy/sell often?

Short to mid term, this could cause quite an operational problem for them, but I’m willing to bet they are going to be able to sort this out long term. 

There is also another issue where Europe requires that they be effectively controlled by Europeans, in order to have their flying license. Creates quite the potential hard no deal Brexit scenario, where some chunk of their investor base is from the UK, and those investors being suddenly classified as Non-European. Throw in other with the nightmarish possibility of all flights being temporarily ceased between Europe and the UK, at least until open sky arrangements are made. 

So, it looks like there are some potential bumps in the road, but this isnt yet certain to play out. Even if it does, I would expect they would eventually make necessary operational adjustments. A trifecta of troubles, that I could imagine over the horizon, could be this Hard Brexit mayhem plus a recession, as much of their travel is discretionary, plus throw in whatever kind of terrorism/accident wildcard into the mess, plus who knows what else could come up. The price has been dropping much, but could always still drop a lot more. 

Regardless, those are all mere possibilities. There is also the other possibility that things somehow get sorted out, and this external turbulence doesn’t come forth. The recent price plunging would/could make this an increasingly compelling investment.

Hey fellow stock investors &amp; traders, I'm sure you've noticed that every single post on r/stocks has deleted comments.  The vast majority of these deleted comments are in fact spam by a bot network that continually creates new users and posts new URLs every day.

Starting around 2 weeks ago (12 days), the bot network replies about 50 to 100 times a day just on r/stocks alone, and goes rampant on all the other subs in the sidebar.

We've tried several techniques with automod to target the bot network to remove the spam comments, including notifying Reddit admins and working with other subreddits to deal with the problem.

I think at this point the problem has been resolved, except the side effect is all these removed comments and that's why I created this post to inform everyone on what exactly has been going on.

Let's take AMD as an example.  As you can see from the link above, the trailing PE ratio is 117 vs the forward PE ratio is only 29.  So I'm going to make a few statements and as a few questions.  If those statements are incorrect please correct me.

- PE is price per share / earning per share.

- Trailing PE is the more accurate number of the two because it is based on the past 12 months.

- Forward PE is the inaccurate number because it tries to predict performance for the next 12 months.

- In the case of AMD the forward PE is lower because analyst is expecting AMD to perform much much better?  It's a growth business?  Analyst is expecting earning to go up.  Thus earning per share number will be bigger thus forward PE will be lower.  Is this correct?

- Since the trailing PE is so high, for AMD, that mean their earning has not catch up to their stock value.  Right now, based on AMD price, is valued for future growth and not actual current performance.  So right now, AMD is over valued and the stock price is higher than needed.  Is this correct?

- In the case of Intel, trailing and forward PE is practically the same, forward PE is slightly lower.  Thus analysts are predicting that Intel will grow, but the company will grow very slightly.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Social-media giant says Libra will be better than Bitcoin. But the company is late to the party and other payment initiatives have stumbled.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Facebook unveiled plans for a new cryptocurrency that the social-media giant hopes will one day trade on a global scale much like the U.S. dollar.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The new currency ""Libra"" will launch as soon as next year and be what's known as a stablecoin -- a digital currency that's supported by established government-backed currencies and securities. The goal is to avoid massive fluctuations in value so Libra can be used for everyday transactions in a way that more volatile crypotcurrencies, like Bitcoin, haven’t been.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Libra is the culmination of a year-long effort to devise an easy way for Facebook users to send and receive money through its messaging services. Private messaging is one of the company’s fastest growing products, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is embracing this by integrating all Facebook’s messaging products to let users communicate between its different apps.

&amp;#x200B;

There is currently a lot of hype around FB and Libra, but long term seems a very smart move for FB. A stablecoin could be used for payments on Facebook and Instagram and for transferring money between friends on WhatsApp and Messenger. As of today FB is $189 with a [price target of $216](https://mpcapital.ai/markets/FB). I definitely have FB on my portfolio.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

\#1 $BYND: After Fridays winning trade, we managed to jump in today premarket and lock in another winning trade. We had said we are very bullish on $BYNDs technicals. (4 Hour Chart). However as of today, we should be seeing a pullback to the low $160s. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 $AMD: AMD is still trading at support ($30s). We are still anticipating the release of their new products. (7nm CPU Rome Server chips, Ryzen PC chips, and the new 7nm Vega GPU hardware). Not to forget their wins with Microsoft’s new Xbox gaming console coming out by next year and Sony’s playstation, this can carry the onward momentum. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 $TSLA: Nailed the swing trade! Tesla hit the highs of $220s today after it is said they are to be delivering 1,000 cars per day. We sold our shares today and plan to rebuy.

“Where the rubber hits the road for domestic cannabis producers is that international trade is largely restricted. And my view is that that is unlikely to change in the next five to seven years at least,” says Martha Harrison, a partner at McCarthy Tetrault LLP who specializes in international trade and investment law.

Canada is signatory to three international treaties that prohibit the movement of cannabis for recreational purposes — the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) and the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, ratified in 1988. Under those treaties, Health Canada has an obligation to restrict the movement of cannabis to “medical and scientific purposes between countries.”

Earlier this year, the World Health Organization, citing new research touting the medical benefits of cannabis made headlines for calling for the removal of the drug from Schedule IV of the 1961 convention, the most restrictive category, which contains Class A drugs such as cocaine and heroin.

But the United Nations has yet to follow through, due in part to the organization’s historically conservative stance on drugs.

“The UN is kind of in an awkward position. They don’t want to dilute controls on marijuana because it would be viewed by some members are diluting controls on all narcotics. It’s kind of that slippery slope argument that you see in governments that are against legalizing marijuana,” says Adams Lee, an international trade lawyer at global law firm Harris Bricken.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,366918,public,,self,"Global marijuana trade is still five to seven years off, but Canada aims to be world's cannabis king",0,1560893542,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c1tg24/global_marijuana_trade_is_still_five_to_seven/,all_ads,6,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'FU8pe-mKgoN-wCQ-lC3XnyR4Od2ncd5g3EZiDhTk0Co', 'resolutions': [{'height': 71, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jN6SxaG5t_HZpl-ZOwumZuqcH9zJbynxxNQTV86QTME.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa6934010d19669967a5a6eae0b33e76f0da5e98', 'width': 108}, {'height': 143, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jN6SxaG5t_HZpl-ZOwumZuqcH9zJbynxxNQTV86QTME.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1d12d5313391e9e232666e695b298a821e4035c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jN6SxaG5t_HZpl-ZOwumZuqcH9zJbynxxNQTV86QTME.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6944574a724eb51498e7c09e4cde3dec8bfe3810', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 305, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jN6SxaG5t_HZpl-ZOwumZuqcH9zJbynxxNQTV86QTME.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3f6e05c6954a1152af13fb49f97162c07304bbcf', 'width': 458}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

Here is my plan so far but I wanted to run it by everyone and let me know what you guys think of what can I do to improve my plan in order to hit my target 

* I'm thinking of starting with only 2000 dollars CAD, I'm not going to do day trading only swing trading until I get the hang of things, time is not an issue. 
* For starting off I'm aiming really low my target is to make 150 dollars a week.
*  I am going to trade on the TSX. I'm not sure if I should trade in penny stocks or more reputable companies. 
* I am thinking of trading in either healthcare or technology sector but you're more than welcome to change my mind.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, June 17th, 2019]()

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open ahead of the Monday session, as investors look ahead to a two-day Fed meeting that begins tomorrow. The Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq were lower in three of the past four sessions, yet they all posted two consecutive weeks of gains. Halfway through the month, June remains on track to be the best month for the Dow this year. (CNBC)
* When Federal Reserve officials meet this week they are expected to clear the way for a July interest rate cut by downgrading their economic forecast, tweaking the language in their statement and reducing their interest rate forecasts. (CNBC)
* The Fed won't cut rates at its June meeting. Here's why (CNBC)
* On today's U.S. economic calendar, the New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing Index is out at 8:30 a.m. ET. The National Association of Home Builders is out with its June sentiment index at 10 a.m. ET. There are no companies reporting quarterly earnings today. (CNBC)
* Shares of Array BioPharma (ARRY) were surging about 60% in premarket trading, after Pfizer (PFE) agreed to buy the cancer-fighting biotechnology company for about $11.4 billion. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction. (CNBC)
* Democratic presidential candidates approach their first televised debates in a scramble for the 2020 nomination, with former Vice President Joe Biden a vulnerable front-runner, a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows.
* President Donald Trump is ready to proceed with tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese goods in the absence of a trade deal, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC today. ""We will eventually make a deal, but if we don't, the president is perfectly happy with continuing the tariff movements.""
* Wilbur Ross: It's 'complicated to negotiate with the European Union' (CNBC)
* Huawei will reduce its production capacity, which could hit revenue growth, the CEO of the Chinese tech giant said today, as he revealed his plans to deal with the continued pressure from the U.S. ""Our revenue will be down by about $30 billion dollars compared to forecasts, so our sales revenue due this year and next will be about $100 billion."" (CNBC)
* China's state news agency Xinhua said the country's investigation into FedEx (FDX) should not be seen as retaliation for trade tensions between the U.S. and China. China launched a probe over parcels intended for telecom giant Huawei delivered to the wrong address. (CNBC)
* Iran said today it will surpass the internationally agreed levels of its low-enriched uranium levels in 10 days. The country would increase enrichment levels to 20%, significantly closer to bomb-grade material, for use in local reactors. (CNBC)

* Raytheon International (RTN) CEO John Harris told CNBC today the Trump administration should not worry about the company's merger with United Technologies (UTX).

* Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg believes the safe return of its best-selling plane, the 737 Max, is the company's most important objective. ""This is a different show for us, it is not about orders,"" Muilenburg told CNBC. The 737 Max was grounded in mid-March after two fatal crashes involving those jets.
* Target (TGT) said its registers are back online after outages over the weekend that prevented shoppers from making purchases on Saturday, and some from using credit cards on Sunday. The retailer said neither problem was caused by a cyberattack. (CNBC)
* Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook warned that Silicon Valley companies needed to take responsibility for the ""chaos"" they create, in a speech at Stanford University. He mentioned no companies by name, but made a reference to disgraced startup Theranos. (CNBC)

I track my portfolio on a monthly basis so the 6 million total is from 6/9/2019. 

Started tracking in 2015 when I was sitting at 2.93m. Started to get more serious about saving then. Average salary in my life has been 200k.

Hit 3m on 3/13/2016.

Hit 4m on 4/9/2017.

Hit 5m on 3/11/2018.

Hit 6m on 6/9/2019. 

5m to 6m took longer than the others due to a flatter market. 

It's mainly index funds with 5 individual holdings in my taxable accounts. I also recently started an M1 account for some higher risk plays but that's only like 100k. 

Cash is not listed within the asset allocation but I have it when I can't find good values. In order to prevent timing the market, my max cash holding is 10% per my investment plan and if it reaches above that, I start investing. Right now cash is at 9.5% of my overall holdings, the highest it's been in a ages. It's only that way because I recently sold a good chunk of my biggest holding.

I still invest every month via 401k/HSA contributions and ESPP even when I'm holding cash so that I'm always pouring money into the market.

Here's to 5m or 7m next!

&gt;India just increased tariffs on US exports, dealing another blow to fragile global trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The tariffs on several US products will go into effect on June 16, India's finance ministry said in a statement Saturday. **The goods targeted include American apples — which will be hit with a 70% tariff — as well as almonds, lentils and several chemical products**.  
&gt;  
&gt;India first announced plans to impose new tariffs a year ago in retaliation for increased US import duties on Indian steel and aluminum. But it repeatedly delayed imposing them while the two sides held a series of trade talks.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Indian government did not specify the value of the goods targeted in its statement, but previously told the World Trade Organization that **they were worth around $241 million.**

# **The Fed is likely to drop ‘patient’ word next week, clearing way for July cut, economists say  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/fed-rate-cut-could-come-sooner-than-some-expect-but-not-yet.html)**
*****
&gt; Even with President Donald Trump and the markets calling for lower interest rates, the Fed is not likely to make a move when it meets next week, though it is expected to smooth the way for a rate cut later in the summer.
*****
&gt; The timing of a Fed rate cut, the first in more than a decade, is up for debate. But such a move has become more of a given in markets, after May’s weak jobs data and softer-than-expected consumer price inflation.
*****
&gt; A growing number of economists and investors are expecting a midsummer rate cut, at the July 30-31 meeting. There are also those who expect the Fed to wait until September, considering more data before cutting rates. Then there are a few, such as economists at Goldman Sachs, who expect no cut at all this year.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the Fed to tilt its message toward lower rates, with officials lowering their interest rate forecasts in the so-called “dot plot,” a chart that anonymously reflects each Fed official’s rate forecast. They are also expected to reduce their outlook for economic growth, and acknowledge weaker inflation.
*****
&gt; “Right now, they’ll just give a very dovish message that leans toward a July rate cut,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. “The market is worried enough about weakness in China, inflation undershooting and the possibility that tariffs disrupt the global supply chain that it’s hard for me not to think the Fed won’t be moving faster than people thought.”
*****
&gt; Trump again criticized the Fed and Fed Chair Jerome Powell for the Fed’s interest rate policy this week, telling ABC News the Dow would be 10,000 points higher if the Fed didn’t raise interest rates. Economists say the president’s assault on the Fed is not likely to have an impact on its interest rate decisions.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s meeting is expected to be the biggest event for markets in the coming week. There is also some data, including manufacturing and services PMIs on Friday, as well as housing starts Tuesday and home sales on Friday.
*****
&gt; Barclays’ chief U.S. economist, Michael Gapen, moved forward his forecast for a first rate cut to July, from September, after last Friday’s weak May employment report of just 75,000 nonfarm payrolls. He expects the Fed to use more firepower than some economists do and expects it to start with a half percent rate cut, rather than a quarter point cut.
*****
&gt; Gapen expects the Fed to modify its statement and change its forecast, which will be released after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. “I’m looking for a modest downgrade of the outlook that could be in their projections, as well as their description of business spending. ... They have to acknowledge vulnerabilities have risen. I think they can highlight global growth and trade uncertainty, as two primary forces. I think they then get away from ‘patient’ and signal flexibility.”
*****
&gt; In the Fed’s dot plot, there are no rate moves expected in 2019, and that is expected to change. Fed officials may also tweak their GDP forecasts. The median central tendency is currently 2.1%. The median inflation forecast was 1.8%, but that could move lower, with PCE inflation readings running at 1.6%.
*****
&gt; Fed funds futures on Friday were signaling market expectations of about a 20% chance of a rate cut next week and about 80% for July. The Fed last raised interest rates in December, when it moved the range for fed funds futures to 2.25% to 2.50%.
*****
&gt; After that meeting, the Fed changed its stance and added that it would be “patient,” pausing policy as it watched economic developments. Economists now expect the Fed to drop that word, signaling a willingness to move forward with rate cuts.
*****
&gt; Chance for a cut next week?
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said she believes the Fed should make a move next week and not wait until July. She said she became convinced Fed officials were ready to move forward with rate cuts after she attended a Chicago Fed conference earlier in the month. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials made it clear the Fed would act to help the economy if it needed to.
*****
&gt; Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida told CNBC at that conference that the Fed would act as needed. “We will put in policies that need to be in place to keep the economy, which is in a very good place right now, and it’s our job to keep it there,” he said in an interview.
*****
&gt; “They were all pretty vocal about it. It was a major shift,” said Swonk. “Could they wait til July? Sure. My own view is if you’re going to do it, do it now because you can control the narrative. That’s important for the Fed to control the narrative.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the Fed could be sending a confusing message next week, if it doesn’t cut. “The dots are going to go down. They’ve got to remove ‘patient,’ they have to acknowledge a weaker labor market, weaker growth, all those things, and the dot plots go down. To me, that’s more confusion than clarity when you’re going to do it in six weeks anyway,” she said.
*****
&gt; Jefferies economists are on the opposite end of the debate, and they do not have an interest rate cut in their forecast.
*****
&gt; “If trade talks completely fall apart and we have a permanent negative impact on our trade relations with China, then we’d get a rate cut, but we don’t expect one otherwise,” said Tom Simons, Jefferies money market economist.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 6/14/19

&gt; This week's economic data came out to a slow and disappointing start as the JOLTS report showed fewer job openings in April than expected and was below the March number. That was the only release on Monday, but activity picked up on Tuesday with a strong NFIB Small Business Optimism report, continuing the second longest streak of monthly gains for the indicator (discussed in Tuesday's Chart of the Day). Producer inflation also came out Tuesday, with a weaker headline print but improved core inflation. Wednesday's CPI also saw some weakness missing expectations on both headline and core measures. Fortunately, we rounded out the week with a heavy slate on Friday with beats nearly across the board. Retail Sales impressed in addition to the previous month being revised up. Industrial production was also stronger than expected while the University of Michigan consumer sentiment improved to 112.5.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/061419-Eco-This-Week.png))**

&gt; Next week quiets down with only 19 releases. June's Empire Manufacturing index from the NY Fed kicks things off followed by homebuilder sentiment. Further in housing data, starts and permits will be out Tuesday morning. While starts are expected to rise, permits are forecasting a small downtick. Later in the week on Friday, existing home sales are forecasted to rise to 5.27 mm SAAR homes. On Wednesday, all eyes will be on the FOMC rate decision. Over the past couple of months, markets have increasingly been betting on the FOMC deciding to cut rates at this meeting or (more likely) in the near future. This event should provide some clarity into this situation. We will finish next week with the Leading Index on Thursday and preliminary June Markit PMIs on Friday.

# What Do Stocks Do After The First Rate Cut?

&gt; It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will cut rates at the upcoming July meeting, with the potential for as many as three total rate cuts this year. This would be the first rate cut since the Fed started hiking rates in December 2015. Concerns over trade and the global economy have sparked much of this worry.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index up nearly 15% for the year, what could this potential first rate cut mean for stocks? After all, the Fed cut rates in January 2001 and September 2007 right ahead of recessions and massive stock market corrections. Could another bear market and recession be headed our way if the Fed cuts rates soon?

&gt; “The previous two times the Fed cut rates for the first time in 2001 and 2007, we saw stocks eventually get cut in half,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But the reality is if you go back further in time, you can also see explosive rallies after that first cut.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, “Not All Rate Cuts Are Created Equal”, shows, since 1984 there have been seven rate cuts that took place after at least one rate hike. The two most recent cuts were followed by poor performance over the next 12 months, but the other five cuts saw solid gains. In fact, the median return for the S&amp;P 500 one year out has been a very impressive 13.9%, which suggests a potential rate cut over the coming months might not be as worrisome as many make it out to be.

# B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales: Even Stronger Below the Surface

&gt; While it may not have looked like anything special based on the weaker than expected headline reading, there actually wasn’t much not to like about May’s Retail Sales report. In addition to being slightly better than expected after stripping out Autos and Gas, April’s report was revised significantly higher.

&gt; The table below shows monthly streaks of gains or losses for each of the sectors tracked in the Retail Sales report. Here we can see how broad and consistent the strength has been in Retail Sales after taking revisions into account. Five sectors have seen m/m growth for five straight months, and no group has seen more than one straight month of decline. Bars and Restaurants are one group that has seen sales growth for five consecutive months, and while it has yet to overtake Food and Beverage Stores in terms of its total share of sales, it’s getting close.

# June’s Boon – 5% DJIA Gain Already

&gt; Nearly two weeks ago we examined the history of June market performance after a down May following a strong January to April. That analysis suggested that this June could produce above average market gains. Thus far, the market has not disappointed. As of today’s close, DJIA is up 5.03% already this June. NASDAQ is second best, up 4.96%. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 are 4.89% higher. Russell 2000 is the laggard of the group, higher by a still respectable 3.96%. The true test for the market will arrive in the second half of the month as the end of the quarter nears. Historically, the second half of June has not been great for the market.

# NASDAQ and Russell 2000 Advance/Decline Lines Lagging

&gt; Typically at this time of the year, first half of June, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are often leading DJIA and S&amp;P 500. Historically, the month of June has been kinder to technology and small-cap stocks than others. Sure, June has been quite robust so far, but it has been DJIA and S&amp;P 500 leading the charge higher. Their strength is also confirmed by NYSE and S&amp;P 500 cumulative Advance/Decline lines at new highs already. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 cumulative Advance/Decline lines are weaker have not exceeded the highs reached last year. At the least, NASDAQ’s Advance/Decline line likely needs improvement for the market to make any meaningful headway.

# Has the Market Entered Its Summer Sideways Phase?

&gt; After bouncing rather solidly off support at 2725 the S&amp;P 500 has run in to some resistance at 2910. This looks like the beginning of the annual summertime sideways phase the market often experiences. Decent economic readings and a dovish Fed are likely to prop equities up some over the usually weaker summer months. While on the other had ongoing trade battles and other political and international skirmishes as well as lower oil, rates and growth are likely to keep a lid on stocks. This sets up the market for some range bound volatility between S&amp;P 2700 and 2900 give or take a few points. Critical support remains at the 2580 near the February/April 2018 lows. A resolution to the China trade deal or some firming in the data could push us higher and deterioration on all fronts would likely push us lower. For now expect backing and filling over the next several months.

# June Option Expiration Can Be Volatile

&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last sixteen years.

&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 25 of the last 29 years with an average decline of 1.09%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 29-year span, declining 0.73% and 0.23% respectively on average.

That stocks fell Friday had less to do with geopolitical tensions between Iran and the U.S. and more to do with tech shares falling lower, a decline led by chip giant Broadcam Inc. due to tensions between U.S. and China and negative Chinese economic data.

&amp;#x200B;

To be sure, investors continue to keep an eye on the Middle East after the Strait of Hormuz skirmish. News of the attacks sent oil futures north on Thursday – more than 2% –  but they fell short of session highs Thursday at the bell. Crude futures increased 0.5% Friday, marking an overall loss for the week ending June 14. Thursday’s gains followed considerable losses on Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday, the International Energy Agency decreased its global oil demand growth forecast, saying there is “plentiful” supply to meet such growth.

&amp;#x200B;

“Geopolitical unrest is going to provide general support for prices, and depending on events, create sharp spikes higher but at the same time, supply and demand fundamentals continue to deteriorate,” said Tyler Richey, co-editor of Sevens Report Research.

&amp;#x200B;

West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery increased 23 cents or 0.4% to settle at $52.51 a barrel on New York Mercantile Exchange. The Front-month contract, to be sure fell 2.7% for the week.

August Brent Crude increase 1.1% or 70 cents to $62.01 per barrel on ICE Futures Europe following a gain of 2.2% on Thursday. Brent was down for the week to 2%.

 I was gifted shares in P&amp;G under the Gifted to Minors Act in 1986. I  am estranged from my parents and have just been notified of their existence.  A cousin reached out to me and we share the same godmother who also gifted them the same stocks roughly 35 years ago.  In a complete fluke, they found the certificate while moving in a safe deposit box and the shares had split and grown so much since then, it was in the 5 figures.   I remember getting mail from them quarterly and then it stopped.  Thought it was spam mail so never opened.  

There is a very large possibility a family member committed fraud and sold them without my knowledge.  Especially since the reaction after asking has been inconsistent and defensive.  (i.e. you told me to sell all of them, there was a stock crash, I don't have the certificate, how could I even fathom they would steal, there was a housing market collapse etc).  I do recall selling some in 2004, but not signing anything or really discussing it.  Was saving for a car, the goal was two grand, and had other money saved so not sure exactly how many I'd sold by then.

  
 How do I go forward to obtain a certificate or track down what happened to them?  I tried using my SSN on the phone, but they don't recognize the number.  Email for them is based on cert. #.   Is there a possibility that under the minors act they would have been under my mother's name at the time of gifting?

I'm not looking to retrieve the stocks or file fraud charges.  I'm looking to do the math, as they are currently 108/share and I would have at least 64, and offer a settlement.

Sometimes it's ist just a fluctuation that happens with certain events (person x sold some shares, a gas station explodes, whatever).  

And then I read about the success stories of people getting so 50-200% out of a stock over a longer period. And when I analyse the charts I see that these stocks also had drops significantly over 10% in this span.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Prior to Beyond Meat's IPO date, I was looking for information on the exact date and I couldn't find any concrete numbers. Fast forward two weeks later my brother texts me saying did I buy BYND?!

Now I am trying to understand when Robynh00d will IPO but again not finding any clear information.

How do I navigate this land of IPOs?

A crisis that will affect the whole world if no one acts on it. Now, I'm not here to talk about climate change, but it is one of the reasons why I am extremely bullish on the solar industry. In my mind, solar energy is the greatest energy to ever exist. If you really think about it, we are taking the nuclear fusion of the big ball in the sky, the sun, and using it for our own energy purposes on earth. Even now, the sun powers the whole world. Without the sun, the earth wouldn't be sustainable for life as we know it. Luckily for us, the sun is out at all times and never fails to give the earth what it needs. Wouldn't it be great if we could harness the sunlight, effectively, and easily, powering the whole world for our energy needs? Well, with the stupidest experiment in mankind inevitably coming to an end soon, fossil fuels, solar panels will be powering the whole world primarily. Additionally, solar panels could easily power the whole world as well, especially big countries like China. The industry is still in its toddler phase with a lot of room still left to expand globally. With prices dropping drastically in recent times regarding solar and with the efficiency of panels going up every year, it is no wonder why installations have skyrocketed in the past 10 years and are poised to do so especially in the future. It is inevitable solar panels are going to be the energy source of the future, and the change from fossil fuels will be coming in the near future. I'd give it within 20 years before solar panels are surpassing big energy sources globally like natural gas. For me, it is a no brainer to be investing in the solar industry. All in all, the market is still very undervalued for what is yet to come, with some great companies existing already. A true solar revolution will be coming up, and I think everyone should be extremely bullish on the industry.

- This letter is the latest of many sent to the Trump administration by Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, the national campaign against tariffs supported by more than 150 trade groups representing agriculture, manufacturing, retail and tech industries.


- Sources have told Reuters there has been little preparation for a meeting even as the health of the world economy is at stake.


- Additional 25% tariffs on $300 billion in imports, on top of those already levied, would wipe out more than 2 million U.S. jobs, the letter said, citing estimates from international consultancy the Trade Partnership.


- They would also add more than $2,000 in costs for the average American family of four and reduce the value of U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 1%, it said.

Airbus SE is considering bringing the world’s first hybrid-electric airliner to market as it weighs its strategy for replacing the bread-and-butter A320neo narrowbody in the next 15 years -- a move that would mark a technological leap for the aerospace industry.

&amp;#x200B;

The European planemaker has grown confident that the revolutionary propulsion system will be ready for roll-out on an all-new single-aisle jet around 2035, according to people with knowledge of its planning. While the company has been public about its interest in hybrid engines, Airbus is now willing to consider powering its most important aircraft with the technology, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing internal deliberations.

&amp;#x200B;

When i take Alibaba as an example , they raised 21,8 billion dollars and the market cap in the beginning was around 167 billion. So what is the math behind this difference. The cap is 8 times the amount of the raised capital. Suferficially this sounds for me like if im a huge investor and payed for a 5% stake of that 21,8 billion valuation, i payed a little bit above 1 billion. That 5% becomes over 8 billion of the market cap around the time the IPO is finished though. This cant be right or that easy to make 700% plus on my original investment after a few months. How does that work?

For better understanding i copied two texts as an example. One for Alibaba and one for Uber. 

___________________________________

Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N) priced its initial public offering at $68 a share, the top end of the expected range, raising $21.8 billion on Thursday, in the latest sign of strong investor appetite for the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut.

At that price, the IPO, one of the largest-ever, would give Alibaba a market valuation of $167.6 billion. Alibaba is selling 320 million shares, equivalent to about 13 percent of the company's capital. Nearly two thirds of those shares are being sold by existing shareholders including Ma, who will reap $867 million.

_____________________________________

Uber Technologies Inc. UBER-9.03% priced its initial public offering at $45 a share Thursday afternoon, and will bring in at least $8.1 billion in the biggest IPO in years. The ride-hailing company announced that it intends to sell 180 million shares at that price, which is toward the lower end of its stated range of $44 to $50. Underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and BofA Merrill Lynch, have access to another 27 million shares to cover overallotments. At the IPO price, Uber would have an initial valuation topping $75 billion.

&gt;The company is working with Finnish developer Next Games on a free-to-play mobile game that will take place in the shadowy Upside Down world featured in the series.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""We are huge fans of 'Stranger Things and thrilled to work together with Netflix to bring our shared vision of Stranger Things into life in a mobile game format,"" Next Games CEO Teemu Huuhtanen said in a statement.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Netflix made the announcement on Wednesday at the E3 gaming conference in Los Angeles.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Stranger Things 3: The Game"" will be a ""location-based puzzle \[role-playing game\]"" and it's scheduled for release in 2020 on iOS and Android platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Stranger Things"" isn't the only Netflix show to get the video game treatment. ""The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics"" will be coming to Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Playstation 4 later this year. That game is based on the Netflix Original series, ""The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Boeing insists it is making progress on getting its fix for the troubled jet approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration, which it needs to put the Max back in the air. But the company has stopped giving any public estimates about when that approval might come.

The fatal crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that prompted the grounding happened three months ago this week. At the time, Boeing extended condolences to the family members of the victims and said it expected a fix ""in the coming weeks."" That software fix is designed to address the plane's automatic safety feature, which is the focus of the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash and another crash involving a Max flown by Lion Air in Indonesia last year.

&amp;#x200B;

Those weeks came and went. After the FAA said in early April that additional work would be needed, Boeing again suggested it would be only a short delay and said the fix would be ""completed in the coming weeks.""

Months later, it's clear the initial time frame proved far too optimistic.

Asked Tuesday for the latest estimate for a return to service for the 737 Max, neither Boeing nor the FAA could give a time frame.

Boeing said it is now providing additional information to address FAA requests that include detail on how pilots interact with the airplane controls and displays in different flight scenarios. Once that process is complete, it will work with the FAA to schedule a certification test flight and complete certification paperwork.

What's more, even after the FAA does approve a fix, Boeing will face the challenge of getting approval from more than 30 other airline regulators around the world. Those international regulators will have to be convinced that both Boeing and the FAA got it right this time.

""The technical fix is relatively simple compared to the political difficulties,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with The Teal Group. ""The need and difficulty is to get everyone on same page, and to assure international regulators.""

Airlines that have the 737 Max in their fleet now aren't expecting the planes back until August at the earliest. On Sunday American Airlines (AAL) canceled flights on its schedule through Labor Day.

They just got fast track approval for their lead candidate vicinium and will be meeting with the FDA for a Biologics License Application later this year. They passed their pre BLA meeting with no additional info requests or safety concerns.

Currently non muscle invasive bladder cancer is treated with BCG, a vaccine that is currently undergoing shortages and was developed two decades ago. No drug company wants to make this product since it has garbage margins.

There are 75k new cases of bladder cancer, 70% being non muscle invasive. They would currently be treated by BCG vaccine with a 40% nonresponsive rate. This is where Sesens product vicinium comes in. Vicinium is the planned alternate to removing the bladder and surrounding nodes through surgery. This effectively comes down to roughly 20k new patients treated with vicinium on a yearly basis. This does not account for multi year patients or partial responses to BCG that would still get treatment by vicinium.

Current market cap is like $150M at just under $2 a share

Oncology drugs can struggle to become profitable when commercialized because there is so much money to be made in this space so it is often crowded and you have to sell your treatment method to providers to recommend over other treatment methods. Vicinium, Sesns treatment, would be a stop gap between BCG non responders or partial responders and having to have bladder removal surgery.

Aka ""Do you want your insurance company to pay for you to try another drug, or do you want us to skip that step and just remove your bladder""

Positives:

1) commercialization in 2020-2021 and substantial revenue possibilities in an under met market

2) being bought out by big pharma- AstraZeneca partners with them already and could reasonably buy out the entire org

Risks:

1) not getting approval- 82% of drugs passing pre BLA meeting get approval, so 18% chance of no approval and stock gets crushed

2) need funds for commercialization and have an equity Raise that dilutes your ownership in the short term

What I can't wrap my head around is that each cloud related technology being insanely valued while said company is not profitable, and in most cases, don't have much pathway to becoming profitable. At the end of the day, you invest your money in a business to receive coupons of certain amounts of money in the future. These coupons come from either equity grown through selling or dividends paid out. With not being profitable, the investor is banking on equity growing though with these insane evaluations, I'd argue that the growth is already priced in (to put it lightly). So you're essentially paying for a piece of technology who is already priced as its envisioned 2022 evaluation. Who's to say said piece of technology is even relevant in 3 years?
