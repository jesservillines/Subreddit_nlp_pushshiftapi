\^TRA Tradeshow 7/2019 (YouTube video linked below)

NaturalShrimp, Inc. **(OTCQB: SHMP)** is a publicly-traded agro-tech company headquartered in Dallas that has developed the first commercially viable system for growing shrimp and other seafood indoors with their patented proprietary technology. NS produces fresh (never frozen), gourmet/sushi-grade shrimp without the use of antibiotics, probiotics, or toxic chemicals. 

**Company and Technology Summary:**

NaturalShrimp set out with one explicit goal in mind; to raise shrimp WITHOUT the use of ANY chemicals, antibiotics in a clean, sanitary, completely organic aqua-farming environment comprised of indoor recirculating sea-water tanks where their location is dependent upon consumer locale rather than any dependency upon coastal regions or even the ocean itself. 

Through the use of their patented “electro-coagulation” (EC) technology, an electrical current is generated in the water and the susceptibility of bacteria and viruses to this electro-disinfectant mechanism results in approximately 99% of all pathogens to be eliminated; therefore, this physical nature and effect of electricity provide the means by which a clean, completely organic environment is maintained. Electrocoagulation is not a new concept, however, to address both essential and critical factors responsible for the demise of most aqua-farming crops; bacterial, viral infection and or the increase in ammonia levels as a result of the waste build-up from shrimp crops; the latter is the arch-nemesis and far more difficult to manage. 

However, the use of EC also confers the other essential benefit by liberating the chlorine molecules in the NACL or salt compound of the seawater that in turn combines with the nitrate compounds building up as a result of increasing shrimp waste levels; the newly formed solid aggregates (Chloramine, NH2CL) are formed that can be readily filtered from the seawater and therefore effectively controlling ammonia levels in the tank environment. 

**Where does our shrimp come from today?**

Are there certain products you wouldn’t consider buying if they were from China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, or India? I know I wouldn’t buy my kid’s baby food or my medications from there and I’d certainly never buy seafood from these places. 

**So, why are we?!** 

An analysis was conducted covering a decade of records from the FDA related to imports, inspections and rejection data from 2006 to 2015. The analysis revealed only 6 % of the total seafood market is domestic whereas 94% comes from imports outside the US and only 2% of these imports are inspected and from this minuscule sampling; only 1 in 9 imports are rejected.

📷

However, from these rare inspections, since 2001, the FDA has detected the use of banned veterinary antibiotic residues on the shrimp crops sampled with unacceptable levels of chloramphenicol and nitrofuran antibiotics imported from China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and India. These antibiotics remain banned and illegal due to the carcinogenic nature of nitrofurans and chloramphenicol use associated with the onset of aplastic anemia. Yet these same banned drug residues still find their way onto American dinner tables merely by overwhelming an already sporadic and ineffective inspection system mediated by the FDA. The danger of tainted shrimp crops is twofold; the bacteria organisms that survive the chronic overuse of antibiotics develop immunity to more and more of the antibiotics used and are elevated to the status of “Superbugs” and the drugs themselves, particularly pesticides can cause neurological, respiratory, organ system damage with prolonged exposure. In the article “[Shrimp containing antibiotic-resistant bacteria found in Canadian grocery stores](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/shrimp-antibiotics-resistance-amr-marketplace-1.5055101?fbclid=IwAR1KxQ4CUv8dFPaHFFM8OqY9fkR3NwcXT6FfhFrbwL7mG89VXAHa4yKbjjE)”; the “Marketplace” periodical cited “17 percent” of the sampled shrimp (9 of 51 shrimp sampled) and tested by the University of Saskatchewan revealed strains of E.coli and Staph Aureus that showed resistance to at least one antibiotic and all but one of the shrimp were resistant to multiple drugs “meaning they have the potential to cause hard-to-treat infections – so called superbugs that antibiotics may not be able to kill”.

**Why Aquafarming?**

The shift from wild-caught to farm-raised seafood where the production of the Aquafarming industry has grown dramatically from 50 million tons (in 1970) annually to over 150 million tons speaks to the necessity to provide environmental relief to land-based farming and the over-fishing of wild-caught species where nearly 90% of the world’s marine fish stocks are categorized as either fully fished to overexploited. 

While seafood comprises 17% of the animal protein consumed in the world, it is estimated 200 million jobs are either directly or indirectly connected to the fisheries sector making fish one of the most traded food commodities worldwide and therefore generates more income than most other food commodities combined. 

For some of the biggest seafood species and markets like North Atlantic salmon; over half of the salmon consumed annually comes from the Aqua-farming industry. The largest seafood industry continues to be shrimp, however, where worldwide, the consumption of shrimp amounts to nearly 5 billion pounds per year. The estimates for this year’s shrimp consumption are set for 1 billion pounds for the US alone. We will never be able to meet the world or even national seafood demand. 

**Why is NaturalShrimp different?**

The NS solution chose to simulate the ideal natural environment of shrimp in their natural habitats where water quality is high and where bacterial and viral infections are not a critical deterrent to healthy cultivation because the entire cascade of out of control oxidation, waste build-up and poor water quality that leads to bacterial and viral infections is eliminated altogether and the focus then becomes how to MAINTAIN the optimal environment rather than a risk mitigation approach. 

This is an altogether DIFFERENT patented solution that did warrant the 18 years of research in order to arrive at a more quantitative, specific and effective technological breakthrough and solution that can in effect maintain optimum conditions within recirculating tank environments albeit a completely clean, organic and healthy methodology for the shrimp organisms and ultimately for us; the consumers. 

**Conclusion**

To understand the essential differences between all of the most innovative models is to appreciate how actually groundbreaking this NS technology is and why such a patented solution that is currently being tested across MANY seafood species (barramundi, salmon, clams, crab, lobster) is poised to become a historical marker and industry disruptor for the seafood industry. 

Can you imagine sitting in the middle of the country, hours away from an airport with the ability to eat freshly harvested king crab legs?! That’s the future in which SHMP is leading the charge. If you believe in socially and environmentally responsible companies (BYND, TSLA, etc) that will disrupt the future with their technology and products, SHMP is a company you be watching. It is simply where the world is heading and the world millennials and future generations want to live in. Always fresh, never frozen, always natural - no antibiotics or chemicals introduced.

Similar to Tesla, there are many applications outside of their core focus in seafood, such as use in both residential and commercial aquariums and pools (multi-billion dollar industries). This is a billion-dollar licensing of their technology opportunity and I can assure you the SHMP team has this on their radar. 

Now, after nearly 20 years of R&amp;D, they’re on their final step to commercial production and massive revenue streams. They’ve stayed pretty quiet and have been flying under the radar until more recently from a publicity standpoint as they prepare to launch into their production phase and uplist to the Nasdaq. I’d encourage you to check out their recent filings and press releases in comparison to previous years (see link below). It is very obvious they’ve hired the appropriate resources to start marketing, selling, and propelling SHMP to the next level. 

Once more institutional investors gain access (most can’t hold OTC assets) and SHMP gains more exposure, the stock should rise steadily. That run should continue and start spiking as that revenue switch gets flipped on in 2021. Barring massive market instability, SHMP shareholders would see massive gains and I truly believe the next few weeks and by the end of November will be the last time you will see prices under .25. By 2022, this could easily be $5-10+ if not considerably more. 

This isn’t that far off from what Beyond Meat did to get started and is doing. Look at their massive market cap of almost $10B with a net revenue of only $297M in 2019 and $87M in 2018. SHMP could easily see that level of net revenue over the next few years, as their Iowa facility alone is forecasting $8-10M in net revenue. 

With their Texas facility up and running already, the major expansion plans (see diagram below), and massive opportunities to license their technology (it has been indicated there are several opportunities to do so), they’ll easily hit the $100M mark and see similar trends from a market cap standpoint to BYND. Thus, rewarding shareholders with an innovative, socially responsible technology and massive gains for early shareholders.

**Fun Facts:**

* (9/16/20) CFO presented at the HC Wainwright Investor Conference
   * **Announced SHMP will be “very profitable” next year as they move into the production phase of their rollout.** 
      * 60-65% margins (this is HUGE)
      * The cost to grow out shrimp are $6/pound
      * The Webster City, Iowa location alone will be producing 15-20k pounds of shrimp per week (270k sq. ft., 240 - 10k gallon tanks, all equipment is new)
      * Full production by late October/early November 2020
   * **Distributing the shrimp fresh, never frozen and always natural**
      * 90% of the shrimp market is frozen
      * As soon as wild shrimp are caught they are dipped in sodium triphosphate and then flash frozen. Sodium triphosphate is a preservative for seafood, meats, poultry, and animal feeds. In foods, STPP is used as an emulsifier and to retain moisture. Many governments regulate the quantities allowed in foods, as it can substantially increase the sale weight of seafood in particular. (per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_triphosphate))
   * **With EC tech, SHMP can raise 4x the density of shrimp compared to biofloc systems in that same cubic yard (much more economical which allows them to be profitable)**
      * Biofloc isn’t scalable (profitable) but does work, however, it is more suited for selling shrimp at a farmers market
      * Current commercial biofloc systems are not profitable and will not be profitable without the use of the NS EC technology (many are already calling SHMP)
   * **Anticipating 2-3 species to be raised in 2021, scaling to more species from there**
      * Many discussions and requests to expand the use of this technology into China for crayfish
      * Very successful in their phase 1 trial to cure amoebic gill disease in salmon. Responded within 3 minutes of being exposed to the technology 
   * **Shrimp larvae are bought from 1 of the 2 growers in the nation but there is work being done internally to build and produce their own shrimp larvae**
      * In 2019, after being assured they were healthy, SHMP unknowingly bought and started growing larvae that were infected with the viral shrimp disease Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV) which resulted in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department quarantining the facility
   * **Announced joint venture in California and Florida that are “both well on their way” - more to come (this could be the licensing of technology play many shareholders are hopeful for)**
* SHMP has an amazingly transparent and open team that readily accepts and acts on feedback, answers questions, and proactively updates shareholders on a regular basis (check out their Facebook group - [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158050257692447/about](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158050257692447/about))
* Their business model allows them to grow fresh shrimp in warehouses in major cities, allowing for a farm to table strategy to provide the freshest, healthiest shrimp possible to restaurants and grocery stores
   * **No deveining required** **- Their technology, process, and regional site business model allow them to stop feeding the shrimp 3 or so days before harvesting so that all waste is expelled from the shrimp at the time of harvest and therefore not requiring you to devein the shrimp**
* $SHMP applied to be uplisted to the Nasdaq on 8/19/20 (this process usually takes 4-6 weeks so their assumed approval should be announced very soon). - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/naturalshrimp-submits-application-nasdaq-capital-113000886.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/naturalshrimp-submits-application-nasdaq-capital-113000886.html)
   * **When this approval happens, they’ll have access to institutional investors with large wallets and the stock price should jump accordingly.**

Cuban says that all American households, no matter their income level, should receive a $1,000 stimulus check every two weeks for the next two months. He proposed this same idea in May and says ""I still believe in doing it the exact same way"" today.

Additionally, families would have to spend each check within 10 days, or they would lose the money, Cuban says. He believes this ""use it or lose it approach"" would be beneficial because it would promote spending, which would help businesses stay open and stimulate the economy.

Without mandating the money be spent within 10 days of receipt, Cuban believes many Americans will save it. ""People are uncertain about their future, so rather than spending, they save,"" he says. He has a point: Many Americans have been saving more amid the pandemic than ever.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - A group of Apple Inc's critics - including Spotify Technoloy SA, Match Group Inc and ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games - have joined a nonprofit group that plans to advocate for legal and regulatory action to challenge the iPhone maker's App Store practices.

Apple charges a commission of between 15%-30% for apps that use its in-app payment system and sets out extensive rules that apps must comply with to appear in its App Store, which is the only way Apple allows consumers to download native apps onto devices such as the iPhone.

Nearly 200 food suppliers, including some of the largest producers in the world, have pledged to cut their food waste in half by 2030.

The companies, which make such products as Rice Krispies cereal, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Spam, have joined the 10x20x30 initiative, a global effort to slash the staggering amount of food that is discarded every year, the World Resources Institute, which supports the program, announced Wednesday. The big food makers — a list that includes Unilever, PepsiCo and Nestle Global — join some of the world’s largest food retailers, who last year signed on to the campaign.

Food manufacturers are only part of the equation. The vast majority of food waste — about 80 percent — happens in homes and in consumer-facing businesses, such as grocery stores and restaurants, according to a report by the nonprofit ReFED. Food manufacturers account for only 2 percent of the problem, while consumers are responsible for 43 percent, per the report.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,531870,public,confidence,self,Nearly 200 of the world’s biggest food suppliers pledge to halve their food waste,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/iyvx1t/nearly_200_of_the_worlds_biggest_food_suppliers/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s unheard of in this advertisement heavy market, unfortunately it’s design has attracted content that has attracted negative attention on more than one occasion. 

I think overall, their model is successful, and even it’s close competitors struggle to carry the same infrastructure, even Disney plus - done right without the ads, can feel sluggish compared to Netflix’s experience in the streaming market. 
Hulu is a joke with it’s ads,
HBO Max has a unique selection, but what brings people in next? It’s old content that did well, Netflix has shows people want to see that dont exist yet. (Next season of black mirror, stranger things, pick your poison)

The truth that will hit most people is that all the companies are corrupt and they still want to watch their shows, so why do the one that doesnt bury you in advertisements.

If things go to what I think might be Netflix’s evil plan 

With shared accounts broken up from the negative publicity of “Cuties”

The market will drop memberships by the handful.. Take a temporary loss in revenue, and then start seeing a potential increase in user base, from the same user base, by having people create new accounts from previous shared account members.

—


The whole market is trending downwards, a ‘reset’ of a historic rally period. 
Now, or I would even predict in a week to two (down trend will likely continue even if it bounces some days), will be the most optimal time to pick up more shares in companies that have great long term potential

I’m looking at:

Netflix - for this reason even though it’s weird

Adobe - recently adopted Allgoretmethic, the 3d software of substance suite, you’re seeing companies like unity going public, adobe on its subscription based model owning the industries most needed tools like substance and photoshop/primere/illustrator/pdf. They own the tech future

If you are wondering why the market dropped today we were at the bottom of the vix uptrend and faield to break below 25/26 level then on top of that dollar breaks above SMA and we spike up. If you don't know in the last 90 days the dollar and s&amp;p 500 are inveresely correlated 95% so when the dollar breaks higher and that quickly too the market drops. in combination with the vix being at the bottom of its range gave high probability to spike up and thats what lead to the drop today.

Stocks turned sharply negative again, erasing yesterday’s gains and continuing the decline from the earlier week as investors weighed slowing economic data and the absence of fiscal stimulus. This was one of the worst sessions in September. The SPY finished 2.35% down, the Nasdaq 3.05% down and the Dow finished 1.93% down. 

Tech shares reversed yesterday’s course and sank, leading the broader market down. Big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) finished around 2% down on average. 

Economic analysts were mostly bearish. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note, “It’s also pretty clear that the rates of recovery have slowed, with only retail sales having completed the V. You can thank the enhanced unemployment benefits for that – $600 per week for more than 30M people, at the peak. It’s hard to be optimistic about September and the fourth quarter, with the chance of a further relief bill before the election receding as Washington focuses on the Supreme Court”.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin once again addressed the urgent need for further stimulus in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee yesterday. Powell underscored the limitations of the Federal Reserve’s lending powers. He said, “Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for others, a loan that could be difficult to repay might not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.” Mnuchin added that he wanted to reauthorize measures under the Payment Protection Program (PPP) that offered forgivable loans to businesses that stayed open and kept most of their employees on payroll. Unfortunately, any reauthorization or reallocation of funds requires Congressional approval, something unlikely to happen with lawmakers unable to come to a consensus about stimulus and focused mainly on the Supreme Court.

Stocks traded choppily before rising in another very volatile session, with traders weighing uncertainty around the presidential election, a worsening coronavirus situation in Europe, and concerns that fiscal stimulus will not come in near-term.  The Nasdaq outperformed, rose 1.86% as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) increased. The S&amp;P finished 1.02% and the Dow finished the day 0.5% up.

The coronavirus situation in Europe has greatly worsened, with experts and politicians warning that a second-wave is around the corner. On September 12, French authorities reported 10,000 COVID-19 cases in one day for the first time since the pandemic began. Since then, daily cases have soared to more than 13,000. Several ""red zones"", cities considered high risk, have seen clampdowns. There is much talk of a second national lockdown in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing that there will be further restrictive measures aimed at containing another major outbreak, as the number of cases swells and top scientists warn that the death rate could grow exponentially. On Monday, the UK reported 4,368 new cases. In Spain, parts of the capital Madrid, saw new lockdown measures enforced on Monday. More than 850,000 residents face restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings, according to Al Jazeera. The EU CDC reported that in Spain, there were 300 cases of COVID-19 per every 100,000 people as the capital of Madrid saw new lockdown measures being enforced.

Prospects of more fiscal stimulus passing before the November election have dimmed, with Congress unable to come to a consensus. Today, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee. They said that the Fed and Treasury can only go ‘so far so fast’ and cannot replace targeted aid from Congress. “The recovery will go faster if we have both tools \[from the Fed and Congress\] continuing to work together,"" Powell said. Both Powell and Mnuchin credited the Cares Act for helping the economy recover at the height of the pandemic but have once again stressed to Congressional lawmakers the importance of targeted, fiscal aid in helping families and small businesses through these tough times.

(NYSE: GTX) (""Garrett"" or the ""Company""), under which KPS will acquire substantially all of the assets of Garrett for approximately $2.1 billion.

Garrett will file a motion with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York today seeking the designation of KPS as the ""stalking horse bidder"" in a bidding procedures motion in connection with the Company's filing of voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. KPS was selected by Garrett after a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives by the Company's Board of Directors. To facilitate the sale process, Garrett has begun a process in the United States to financially restructure through a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding. The completion of the sale is subject to court approval, among other customary conditions. KPS currently expects the sale process to be completed in early 2021.

KPS, through an affiliate, has also agreed to participate in Garrett's Debtor in Possession (""DIP"") financing to support the Company's operations. Following court approval, the DIP facility will ensure that Garrett has sufficient liquidity to continue normal operations and continue to meet its financial obligations during the Chapter 11 process, including the timely payment of employee wages and benefits, continued servicing of customer orders and shipments, and other obligations.

With buy and hold you have the potential to make more that is left on the table through selling quick, and you don't have to pay as much taxes. However, if the market goes down you're stuck holding the bag and you feel like you missed out on another opportunity cost, but oftentimes when the market goes down all sectors go down as well so there is no safe bet. 

With short term trading you get out quick if you cap gains at 5-10%, but you miss future profits. You don't have to worry about huge downward dips though. Short term trading does require more time and can mess with your emotions and have you constantly looking at your stocks. Also, everything sounds good with swing trading but it could be more unpredictable in practice.

Even during the dips like now is it better to buy and hold say if you bought in at Microsoft 3 weeks ago at 210 then it went to 225 in 3 weeks would you make more money short term selling over small peaks like that in your life, or would you make more just buying it at that set price 210 and leaving it alone?",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,530151,public,confidence,self,Buy and hold or Short term trading better?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ix9n87/buy_and_hold_or_short_term_trading_better/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have an opportunity to grow as a premier EV Company. In July 2020 they delivered  2,610 cars. Tesla led the market with 11,575 cars delivered in July 2020. As shown by this link [https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020) China's influence on the EV market grows with every year and is the biggest EV market in the world. NIO currently trades at $18.75  a value that may look like a premium to others but an opportunity once it grows as a bargain. According to CNN business NIO has  1 year forecast of $120.46 according to 16 analysts. [https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=nio](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=nio). This looks like a premium value for NIO which it is. The future is Electric as more countries realize that ICE vehicles will not help with Global Warming targets. According to the Agust from NIO ""NIO delivered 3,965 vehicles in August 2020, a new monthly record representing an 104.1% year-over-year increase."" They will grow as they are expanding their monthly vehicle output to 5 thousand per month. 21,667 cars were delivered in 2020.  NIO is the 7th largest car manufacturer with 21,667 cars delivered throughout 2020. In my opinion they will continue to grow not only because of NIO cars, but with NIO Home a place where NIO car owners can meet and hangout and boost productivity. NIO home adds an extra element as a subscription model which is very profitable as shown by Microsoft and streaming services.  NIO is trying to be a brand such as TESLA. NIO is one of the first company with Battery swap instead of plug in. This is great for high density locations as they can grow and pack them in places with lost of people to service lost of people. Also NIO just launched BaaS which allows you to rent a battery and make the total car cheaper. The NIO car is already cheaper then a Tesla Car. NIO will grow not only because of Battery swap because it takes less then 5 minutes got change your battery and have a full battery. Also NIO is working on an app to allow you to buy preowned cars and since the battery is swappable it can be reused many times. This is my opinion on why NIO will become a big car company in China. This may turn out to be a terrible investment but it is one I have to take as a see the future of green energy and EV cars as they can help slow down global warming which will only get worse by year. The great investor Warren Buffet once said""*Only buy something that you’d be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.” Climate change is a seriuous probelm and through innovation NIO will become a great investment and will help solve this serious threat to our society.*

With buy and hold you have the potential to make more that is left on the table through selling quick, and you don't have to pay as much taxes. However, if the market goes down you're stuck holding the bag and you feel like you missed out on another opportunity cost, but oftentimes when the market goes down all sectors go down as well so there is no safe bet. 

With short term trading you get out quick if you cap gains at 5-10%, but you miss future profits. You don't have to worry about huge downward dips though. Short term trading does require more time and can mess with your emotions and have you constantly looking at your stocks. Also, everything sounds good with swing trading but it could be more unpredictable in practice.

Even during the dips like now is it better to buy and hold say if you bought in at Microsoft 3 weeks ago at 210 then it went to 225 in 3 weeks would you make more money short term selling over small peaks like that in your life, or would you make more just buying it at that set price 210 and leaving it alone?",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,530123,public,confidence,self,Buy and hold or Short term trading better?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ix8m10/buy_and_hold_or_short_term_trading_better/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stocks continued sinking Monday, with the three major indexes extending last week’s declines. The drop continued as traders became concerned with stagnating improvement in coronavirus cases and political uncertainty, with the US presidential election around 6 weeks out. The Dow fell the hardest today, finishing 1.84% down, the Nasdaq finished 0.39% up, and the SPY was 1.07% down.

Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research said, “The root causes of the recent drawdown in US large caps are \[first\], recent weakness in real-time economic indicators, \[second\] the lack of movement on a fiscal stimulus package that could offset #1 and \[third\] the Fed’s lackluster forecasts in its Wednesday release of the Summary of Economic Projections”.

Shares of major bank stocks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), HSBC (HSBC) and Deutsche Bank (DB) fell following a report that they and other financial institutions for decades facilitated fund transactions used for allegedly criminal activities, and failed to report suspicious activity. The report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found five global banks moved ""staggering sums of illicit cash for shadowy characters and criminal networks that have spread chaos and undermined democracy around the world."" The report cited documents leaked by BuzzFeed News that identified more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions’ internal compliance officers as possible money laundering or other criminal activity, including $514 billion at JPMorgan and $1.3 trillion at Deutsche Bank.

“Reopening stocks”, or stocks benefits when the economy looks like it will reopen soon amid the pandemic, fell steeply today, as fear over coronavirus cases here and abroad led to fear of more business closure. In the US, there are now, sadly, 200,000 deaths and new cases have risen in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota, per Yahoo Finance. WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic and that a ‘very serious situation is unfolding in Europe”. Cruise stock Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) fell more than 7% in intraday trading, and airlines including United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL) were each down at least 6%.

Stocks ended sharply down in a volatile trading session, as investors and traders became more cautious following the Federal Reserve’s announcement yesterday and conflicting information and timeframes regarding a potential coronavirus vaccine.

The sell-off was led by big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), which extended yesterday’s losses and soured overall market sentiment. It appears that after the historic rally in August and since the March bottom, traders are rethinking the prospects of a continued, sharp economic recovery in the face of no additional fiscal stimulus. The volatility this month highlights the effects this still-raging pandemic has on the economy. 

Another 860,000 workers filed for unemployment claims this week, with claims remaining below 1 million for a third straight week. The number of unemployed persons also fell below 13 million, an encouraging sign for a recovering labor market.  

Fed officials upgraded their economic projections for this year, and now anticipate a shallower decline in real GDP and a lower unemployment rate by year-end versus their early-summer projections. Still, officials suggested that the quicker-than-expected early economic recovery could be jeopardized in absence of further fiscal stimulus. Powell said, “It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.” Again, Powell is urging Congressional lawmakers to pass additional fiscal stimulus.

The expiration of the CARES Act and enhanced unemployment benefits have left millions of Americans unemployed and without support in the middle of a pandemic. While the stock market is okay (relatively), Powell and other FOMC members have stressed the financial burden this pandemic has placed on small businesses and individuals, urging Congress to pass more fiscal stimulus. 

President Trump agrees with Powell and on Wednesday called on congressional Republicans to support a massive economic relief bill with “much higher numbers” and stimulus payments for Americans, abruptly proposing an entirely different plan from what the Senate GOP sought to advance in recent days. Trump advocated for the $1.5 trillion plan unveiled by the bipartisan house committee, the Problem Solvers Caucus.  The proposal includes a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks to individual Americans, a provision omitted from an approximately $300 billion plan Senate Republicans tried unsuccessfully to pass last week. Pres. Trump said, “I like the larger amount, I’ve said that. Some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with that because I like the larger number. I want to see people get money.”

Trump’s claim yesterday that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready by November went against statements made the same day by Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC. Redfield said he does not expect a vaccine to be ‘widely available’ until the third quarter of next year. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows responded by saying “not sure where Dr. Redfield got his particular timetable, but it’s not based on those that are closest to the process.” In response, the WHO said, “It is important  we have consistent messaging by officials worldwide”.

In an unfortunate development, WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic. Europe has reported 300,000 cases in one week, the highest 7-day total since the start of the pandemic. In total, Europe has reported about 4.9 million coronavirus cases and 226,524 deaths.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

As the title suggest I am fairly new to stocks and have a quick question for Microsoft.

I am invested in Microsoft for the long term, and don’t plan on selling for at least a few years as I genuinely believe in this company.

With this being said, with the big news of their recent future $7.5bil purchase of gaming studios, why is the stock still in decline? 

Could it be a reflection of the entire stock market as a whole? I understand we are still in uncharted waters during these times, but how do stocks typically react with such big acquisitions? I believe this is one of the biggest gaming acquisitions possibly of all time.

It's starting to seem like nobody has any idea what's going on when it comes to the deal to spin off TikTok global into a newly independent US company.

Just hours after ByteDance claimed that the terms of the deal with Oracle and the White House would allow it to retain 80% ownership in TikTok Global, President Trump said during a TV interview that ""**China must give up majority control, or no deal**.""

Does that mean the deal is 'off' again? It's not really clear. Because immediately after, Trump said the planned TikTok IPO would dilute China's ownership to minority status anyway (American investors - a host of VC firms - already own 40% of ByteDance, and with TikTok and Oracle expected to take a combined 20%, it's not clear how ByteDance's 80% ownership would break down between Chinese and American investors).

TIKTOK IPO WILL BRING DOWN CHINA CONTROL OF U.S. CO.: TRUMP

Minutes later, Axios reported that, contrary to prior reports which gave Oracle and Wal-Mart a combined one-fifth stake in the company (which is being valued at a whopping $60 billion), the American corporate odd couple would have ""no ownership"" in the new entity. If that's the case, then what, exactly, is Wal-Mart even doing?

At this point, **investors should take everything they see and read about the Oracle-TikTok deal with a grain of salt**.

Except, perhaps, this: In today's WSJ, the paper's editorial board slammed the Trump Administration, saying that it would be better to ""kill"" TikTok than move ahead with this ""statist"" monstrosity of a deal.

As WSJ reminds us, since the deal was apparently never approved by CFIUS, it could ultimately face a retroactive review like with the Grindr deal, since TikTok collected reams of U.S. user data including IP addresses, geolocation-related data, browsing and search history, and cookies.

Friday the market broke down below critical support and this morning futures are sharply lower. This confirms the breakdown in my eyes. We appear to be in for a bear run.

Don't try and call the bottom here. It might be the open today, it could be March lows, or lower.

Interestingly there were a lot of stocks making 52-week highs on Friday. I'm willing to be selectively bullish with tight stops in place.

**Watchlist:**

**TCON** is a low float, support at $6

**SOL** is a low float, resistance at $3

**ETON** is a low float, support at $8.50

While at least some of these transactions are caught and documented in internal audits, which may then even be reported to the authorities, neither the banks nor the authorities are making much of an effort to put an end to these. The authors of the article suggest that the banks just want to keep the business while officials fear cracking down on the banks as it might set negative precedents that would require them to take legal action against dozens of banks, causing enormous economic damage and political fallout.

While this shouldn't be much of a surprise to anyone, it's interesting to see how this system emerged over the past two decades. I also wasn't aware that the authorities were complicit in it to this extent. I suspect that this leak won't have much of an impact, though - neither on the banks, nor on the market. I will definitely keep an eye on some of the big finance symbols on Monday, though.

“A lot of people are for the first time looking to freelance as a way to make a living during the pandemic because of the unique challenges of the pandemic and because of how flexible freelancing is,” Upwork’s Chief Economist Adam Ozimek told Yahoo Finance’s “The First Trade” this week.

Another lure of the freelance economy is the earning potential. According to Upwork’s study, 75% of respondents said they earn the same or more in pay than when they had a traditional employer.

The demographic of the freelance economy is also quickly changing due to the pandemic. In the study, freelancers consisted of 50% Gen Zers (age 18-22), 44% Millennials (age 23-38), 30% Gen Xers (age 39-54), and 26% Boomers (those over 55 years of age).",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,528908,public,confidence,self,"Study: Freelancing surges in coronavirus era, workers find pay, flexibility attractive",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/iw5vdu/study_freelancing_surges_in_coronavirus_era/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But there's one thing that I don't think people have really touched on; if a successful active investor is genuinely skilled and can often beat the market, what would be the point of telling Warren Buffett or anyone else about it in the first place?

If someone can so consistently beat the market, it's not hard to assume that that person will become rich in a few years or so. But there's a lot of problems that come with letting anyone know you're rich; people will despise you out of jealousy, friends and family will ask you for money and get upset if you refuse one day, people will marry you just to divorce you and take half your money later, and if a friend of a friend of a friend knows that you're rich they might rob you. There's literally no reason to let anyone know that you're rich. And in the case of investing, there's no reason I can think of to tell people your strategies, if you're successful and know why. Even in the case of professional mutual fund portfolio managers; if you really are skilled, then why would you even want a ""real job"" if you can generate an income at home via Robinhood with your own funds?

I ask because my mother is friends with a rich couple who explained that they got their wealth from investments but were never willing to disclose what they are or how they were able to figure things out. Thus, when people state that stock picking skills are rare or non-existent and it's mostly based on luck or risk, are they somehow taking a lack of self-reporting into account? How can you be so sure if there's no incentive to telling anyone about it?

Don't get me wrong, seeing my own holdings continue to decline after technical indicators predicted otherwise leads me to believe the overall message that skill might not exist.

I would think: ""Ummm... duh... to have more money than I do now!"" However, now that I am 38 years old, I understand the question a little better. I want to provide safety and security for my wife, our two children, and our dog. I want to have a good job that I value and find happy moments doing. I want to travel, I want to be with my family and friends whenever possible. I want to live in serenity and not fixate all the time on money and things I do not have. 

Thusly, their sage advice, was to invest in index funds, ETFs, and 'set-it-and-forget-it' modes of saving so that I could focus on my goals mentioned above. 

I find that I turn to the stock market - if I am really being truthful to myself - when I am struggling with chronic worries and chasing short-term fixes (often with longer-term consequences). The intensity of my overwhelming emotions (re-starting work amid pandemic, my little children being a lot to work with each day, my wife being unemployed since December) is a lot to handle and the quick dopamine shot of watching a stock turn green for a bit on Robinhood gives me just the distraction I need to not focus on what is really upsetting me. However, then, as we all know, it turns red. I start to fixate, obsess, look every 5-10 seconds, watching that ticker bump up or down and just praying to God I didn't just lose my family money (thus jeopardizing the very things I value mentioned above). 

I hope all of you are doing well - I truly believe the more we all do better the more we all do better (a Paul Wellstone-ish sentiment) - I just wanted to let you know my experience in case it could help anyone make wiser decisions when it comes to the stock market and investing. 

Were you to be experiencing similar anxieties as I have been, what works better for me is: taking long walks, doing the things I mentioned above as my goals, cooling off, practicing mindfulness breathing or meditation, anchoring myself where I am, and monitoring my body and mind and how I am feeling to gauge whether or not I am enjoying what I am currently doing. (i.e, if I am losing whole days panicking over stock - which I have done - then perhaps I am not in my comfort zone and could be spending my time more wisely doing something else).

I wrote this a month ago for my trading friends.   


 Why I am bullish long term for TMUS. This is a stock to buy and hold.   
  TL;DR: Financials are rock solid and their technology deployment is ahead of AT&amp;T ($T) and Verizon Wireless ($VZ)   
TMUS is known as the self-branded UnCarrier. They built a brand based on customer service, cheaper plans, and spent money on building their infrastructure. Recognizing that people needed an affordable option to the giants in the industry, they worked hard to take a bite of the pie T and VZ so greedily ate from. T and VZ boasted large consumer bases, name recognition, and coverage unmatched any other competitor. Also helps these giants are from the AT&amp;T Antitrust breakup of 1984. They had capital that was unmatched. When you have this near strangehold on industry, you can charge whatever you want within reason of your next biggest competitor. The classic back-and-forth for the better deal is an industry norm but lead to higher prices for same coverage and less happy consumers. Along comes TMUS. They started to eat from the pie but realized they couldn't do it alone. So they came to Sprint with a merger. With that came customers and, more importantly, technology. Now as consumers and the industry looks forward to 5G wireless,it is becoming apparent who will be eating a larger share of the pie. T and VZ have a problem they created for themselves and TMUS is capitalizing on it. 

  
  So how is this relevant to the stock pricing? Currently, TMUS is at $115.01, T at $29.69, and VZ at $58.99. A deeper look into their financials is needed. 

  
  Quick notes:   
  EPS: + is good, - is bad CFPS and FCFPS (cash flow per share and free cash flow per share): + is good, - is bad Sales per Share: + is good, - is bad Debt to Capital: Lower number good, higher bad Fixed Charge Coverage: Higher number good, lower bad 

  
  TMUS: EPS: 2.87, YOY +16%, 5Y uptrend CFPS: $15.45 FCFPS: $6.94, YOY+1%, 5Y uptrend Sales per Share: $52.12, YOY +3%, 5y uptrend   Debt to Capital ratio: 49.7, YOY -8.9%, 5Y downtrend Fixed Charge Coverage ratio: 3.01, YOY +2.9%, 5Y uptrend 

  
  T: EPS: $1.64, YOY -44%, 5Y trend choppy CFPS: $7.99 FCFPS: $3.58, YOY+20%, 5y low but rising last 2 years Sales per Share: $24.66, YOY -1.74%, 5y downtrend Debt to Capital ratio: 42.8, YOY -7.7% 5y downtrend Fixed Charge Coverage ratio: 3.07, YOY +3.5%, 5Y downtrend except last year 

  
  VZ: EPS: $4.62, YOY +19% 5Y small uptrend CFPS: $10.21 FCFPS: $3.50, YOY+37%, 5Y small uptrend Sales per Share: $31.85, YOY +0.5%, 5Y small uptrend Debt to Capital ratio: 61.5, YOY -7.06%, 5Y downtrend Fixed Charge Coverage ratio: 4.75, YOY -4.87% 5Y downtrend 

  
  So as you can see, VZ has great financials compare to T or TMUS, yet their stock is low. Why? Their debt. 61.5% D2C and a FCC of 4.75, with the trends going the wrong way. VZ also has had slow subscriber growth lately. Its churn rate (customer loyalty) is going up, which is bad. It is currently at 1.3% according to Statista.com   
  Then you have T. T is a very diversified company. While its bread and butter is its wireless side, it has a lot more places where it is taking hits from. Of these are the entertainment, TV subscribers, and its wired “landline” DSL, phone, and fiber to the home base. It has to focus on a lot at once. Its revenue It also has a churn of 1.2% for its wireless side.     
  Finally, you have TMUS. T-Mobile has everything going right for it. From the sales rising to debt going down, its financials are rock solid. They also have 1 focus, wireless customers. Sales per share is HUGE, over double that of T and 62% greater than VZ. The debt is less than VZ, who is a mostly wireless company, but almost on par with T.  TMUS is focused on delivering not only value to its customer but also to their investors, boasting a near 100% increase of FCFPS over T and VZ. Their churn rate? Less than 1%. They boast the most loyal customers now of the big 3.   

  
  So from a financial stand point, they are solid. What about their technology? 

  
  5G is around the corner and is the current rage. T and VZ are boasting 1 gigabit per second (Gbps, not to be confused with GigaByte per second or Gbps) straight to smartphones! That is fiber speeds done wirelessly, with a latency that rivals coaxial wire services. Yet, it comes with some catches. First, it uses mmWave technology. This is high frequency radio waves. Sounds good right? Kinda. While it delivers fast speed, it has next to nothing for strength. It is easily blocked be your hand. The current solution is to have multiple antennas in your phone so your hand doesn't block the signal. It also typically has short distance as it is best when it is in line-of-sight (LOS). The technology isn't there yet to help it go beyond 1 mile. So how is TMUS uniquely positioned?   
Well, short version is TMUS bought Sprint. Sprint owned a mid-band wireless spectrum (2500mhz or 2.5ghz). T and VZ doesn't have this band. This band has a theoretical maximum of 900Mbps. It is also currently deployed in Europe as the foundation of 5G there. No other carrier has this band. It reaches several miles. Real world results is somewhere around 125-250Mbps, latency around 14ms. This is huge, Not only does TMUS now own this band, but Sprint was rolling it out. This band is a game changer.     
  So what does T and VZ own?     
  VZ only owns a lot mmWave band of 28ghz and 39ghz. This is the one that they boast reaches 1Gbps speed. It also has very short distance so it requires a lot more cell sites. More cells, more upkeep, more capital. This is great for venues like stadiums or very densely populated areas, like cities. But the limitations is its lack of power. Simply turn your back to the cell means you lose signal. The fall back is 4G LTE.   
  T owns some 24ghz and and some 39ghz licenses. They will be deploying these to pockets of dense areas within cities. So again, you have either low band 5G or 4G LTE   
  TMUS and T also own a low band 5G. This is the band near where 4G LTE currently sits. We already experience it. Typical download speeds of 30Mbps is normal. However, expect to see a 15-20% increase with it being used in 5G. How does that work? They update the equipment and backhaul. 5G cell towers also allow for more people connected before being choked by number of users. This is where T gets away with renaming 4G LTE as 5GE, as these towers have upgraded equipment but its not “true” 5G. This spectrum will be the backbone of 5G. It allows for several hundred square miles of coverage with 1 tower.   

  
  Awesome. How can TMUS keep becoming more valuable? Well, they've started it already. 

  
  You know the #1 thing rural customers dont get? Decent internet. Currently, DSL is what covers most of rural America, if they can get it. When they do “get” it, it is usually less than 10Mbps and going through cable that was laid in the 1970s and 1980s. I would know, I work for a very large ISP. In fact, VZ has sold off most of its landlines to Frontier (in bankruptcy). T still has many hundreds of thousands customers on DSL. T and other Telecoms have lobbied, and won, the ability to just stop providing service to customers because it costs too much to maintain. That leaves gaping holes that Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) are trying to capitalize on. Most people have cellphones and have resorted to using them as hotspots or buying a hotspot from their cellular company. Have you seen their prices and datacaps? VZ offers a “5G Jetpack” for $60/m and only 10GB of data. You can spend $150 a month and get 40GB. That is still a crime.   
  So all of these guys are trying to test out 5G Home Internet. Sounds good right? Let's refer back to the technology. 5G Home Internet from VZ or T will have great speeds... if you are in a densely populated area. In fact, you wont get much better speeds than what your phone currently gets if you are outside of densely populated areas. There is also the consumer base they currently have. They are starting to shut down high cost DSL areas and switch people over to more expensive hotspot plans. So this is a conversion of their customer base. VZ, once fully deployed, will now be able to compete better against T. So you wont see much customer growth here. In fact, you'll start seeing losses. Those losses? They are brand new TMUS customers.   
  Remember that midband Sprint owned? It goes further and offers higher speed than 4G LTE and low band 5G? Yep, TMUS is starting to deploy a no datacap home internet. This will be what propels TMUS to rival VZ and make better returns for investors. This will be brand new customers for TMUS. Where will these customers come from? You will see people leave CTL (Now LUMN), FTR, T, VZ, WINMQ, and SATS (Hughes Net) for the new competitor. More choice, more speed, ability to bundle phone services. What more could go better for TMUS? The only other new competitor you will see in the home internet arena is StarLink but it has yet to reach its full potential and may never reach the low latency that 5G is offering. People will drop their 10Mbps DSL, 25Mbps WISP, and 30-40Mbps 4G LTE cellular internet for a 125-300mbps, mid-band, cheap, low latency no data limit contender known as T-Mobile. While T and VZ will be busy converting their customers from 4G LTE to 5G with little subscriber growth, you will see TMUS boast subscriber growth like never seen before.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,528583,public,confidence,self,"Why I am long TMUS, a look into the technology driving 5G",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ivts28/why_i_am_long_tmus_a_look_into_the_technology/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So long story short, I have a real account with a few investments in Charles Schwab.

Problem is I would like to have something like a demo or simulator where I can test out real stock with fake money. Schwab doesn't have this feature.

I have tried multiple apps, which were all rubbish. I tried Tradingview which works, but it won't let me make a watchlist unless I buy premium. I tried to sign up for Robin Hood, but it isn't signing up, the page just keeps loading but it never loads (all other websites work fine for me). I also tried investopedia, but their game has too many links for me to keep track of.

So out of desperation I'm asking here. Is there any simple simulator where I can just open up a chart and analyse it? Without paying special fees, and getting loads of confusion?

Looks like we have the next booming sector following Compass Pathways (a Psilocybin biotech who are using it to aid mental illness) IPO'd and rallied 73%, backed by Peter Thiel. 

Not to mention pacific islander plant root **""Fiji Kava""** which has been called Natures Xanax, which was shunned in the early 2000's under what many allege was big pharmas lobbying in a similar token to how medicinal cannabis was attacked. All the benefits of Xanax, without the downside - no benzo withdrawals, almost nil side effects, all natural.  

For those that are unaware, across US/UK colleges clinical trials are underway testing the efficacy of microdosing plant based compounds in their aid against mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression with extremely promising initial results. 

What does this mean for Big Pharma sector who have their benzodiazepine and SSRI drugs at the forefront of this addressable market? Which are ineffective and addictive, let alone recreationally abused (Xanax as a prime example) in which these plants do not exhibit the same negative side effects?

I think over the next 10 years, this will be the next red hot booming sector as it makes a dent in big pharma revenue - which means m&amp;a activity!

# **Dow drops 240 points Friday as stocks fall for a third straight week  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/17/stock-futures-are-flat-in-overnight-trading-after-dow-snaps-a-4-day-win-streak.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks fell on Friday to end a volatile week as investors continued to dump shares of high-flying tech companies.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 244.56 points, or 0.9%, to 27,657.42. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.1% to 3,319.47. The Nasdaq Composite also fell 1.1% and closed at 10,793.28. The S&amp;P 500 hit its lowest level of the month on Friday after reaching an all-time high on Sept. 2.
*****
&gt; The major averages fell for a third straight week, notching their longest weekly losing streaks since last year. The Dow posted a slight week-to-date loss. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.7% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.6% over that time period.
*****
&gt; Shares of Apple dropped more than 3% on Friday. Microsoft and Alphabet pulled back by 1.2% and 2.4%, respectively. Netflix dipped 0.1%. Facebook fell 0.9%.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing short-term under performance from these stock but also outperformance over the long term,” said Mark Travis, CEO of Intrepid Capital. However, he noted that tech’s struggles are likely to be short-lived. Many of these companies “generate a lot of cash and have impenetrable balance sheets. They are also ubiquitous in terms of people’s use of them.”
*****
&gt; Big Tech was also down broadly week to date. Facebook and Amazon have each dropped more than 5% this week. Alphabet, Netflix, Apple and Microsoft are also down sharply over that time period. For the month, all six stocks are down at least 10%. Apple, specifically, has plunged 17.2% in September. From their peak, Apple shares have fallen 22.6%; the company has also given up $500 billion in market value.
*****
&gt; Friday’s moves came as a series of individual stock, ETF and index options expired, potentially adding to some of the session’s volatility. Tech stocks like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are among the names where investors had been aggressively buying call options. There was heavy activity Friday in Apple call options, for instance, which expired out of the money. Apple fell 3%. Options in Tesla are also actively traded, but that stock was higher.
*****
&gt; “If you look at the options activity, we knew it was elevated in the technology names for the month and the quarter,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s definitely going to have a large influence on the underlying activity...It’s probably had an impact on stocks today and earlier in the week.”
*****
&gt; The quarterly expiration comes after a summer of record buying in options by individuals and institutions, and many of them were bullish bets on technology and momentum stocks. Index options and futures expired at the opening bell Friday.
*****
&gt; Tensions between China and the U.S. also dampened market sentiment after the U.S. government said it will block all TikTok and WeChat downloads in the country on Sunday. Oracle, which is trying to take a minority stake in TikTok-parent ByteDance, fell 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was coming off a sharp drop in the previous session as investors were on edge about the outlook on further coronavirus stimulus as well as the timing of a viable vaccine.
*****
&gt; Republicans and Democrats are still struggling to agree on how much aid to continue to provide in a follow-up bill to the previous $2 trillion package. President Donald Trump said Wednesday he liked “the larger numbers,” urging GOP lawmakers to go for a bigger coronavirus stimulus, but his comments left Republicans skeptical.
*****
&gt; “The signs point to a decelerating U.S. economic recovery and increasing thematic risks,” analysts at MarketDesk Research said in a note. “It feels as if the bullish market narrative is changing in real time. Given all of the headline risks, we would error on the side of caution in the coming months.”

&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 2

&gt; As we noted last week, the demand for election charts is off the charts (pun intended), so we are sharing some of our favorite election charts.

&gt; Without further ado, here are some more election charts you need to know as November 3 inches closer.

&gt; How stocks perform three months before the election has a stellar track record of predicting who will win in November. If stocks are higher, the incumbent party tends to win, while if stocks are lower, the incumbent party tends to lose. This indicator accurately predicted the winner 87% of the time (20 of 23) since the late 1920s.

&gt; Building on this, if President Donald Trump is going to win, right about now is when the S&amp;P 500 Index should start to outperform. Of course, if it weakens, it could mean we will be looking at a President Joe Biden soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Speaking of presidents up for re-election, here’s what the S&amp;P 500 historically has done during re-election years.

&gt; Lastly, here are two final charts that may help forecast the outcome.

&gt; If real per capita disposable income is higher, the incumbent president usually wins. Conversely, if wages are weak, that bodes well for someone new in the White House. Given real per capita disposable income is up more than 7% this year, it would suggest President Trump should take more than 70% of the votes. Of course, this is greatly skewed due to the CARES Act, so we’d put a major asterisk next to this one.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; To sum up, Gallup poll approval ratings have done a nice job of predicting how many votes a president up for re-election might get. With a 42% Gallup approval rating currently, this comes out to 49% of the total votes for President Trump, which points to a close race.

&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 3

&gt; One of the top requests we’ve received the past few weeks is for more charts on the US elections. We shared some of our favorite in Election Charts You Need to See: Part 1 and Part 2, and today’s the third blog in our series on this important event.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index earnings are expected to jump close to 23% in 2021 according to FactSet, as the global economy recovers. Presidential nominee Joe Biden has made it very clear he will likely hike taxes, which could potentially cut 10 percentage points off earnings growth next year if implemented. If Biden wins, we would expect Chinese tariffs to be removed as well, which would offset some of that impact and according to our friends at Strategas Research Partners would suggest earnings growth of nearly 17%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in our LPL Chart of the Day, how the US dollar does ahead of the election has been a great indicator of which party might win in November. If the dollar is weak three months before the election, this bodes well for the incumbent party, while the incumbent party tends to lose if the dollar is strong. This signal has been right 7 of the past 8 elections.

&gt; As we saw back in March, when trouble hits, the US dollar tends to do well, as investors flock to the safety of the world’s reserve currency. When things are calm, the dollar tends to weaken, which favors riskier assets. So far, the dollar is slightly lower, which would suggest a potential win for President Donald Trump.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.18.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Also, the size of the tax increase proposed by Joe Biden as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) would be one of the largest ever and rival President Lyndon B. Johnson’s (LBJ) tax increases in the late 1960s. Let’s remember though, if there’s a split Congress, the chances of the full tax plan being implemented is quite slim. Additionally, a weaker economy would also reduce the chances of a large tax hike.

&gt; # Seasonal Volatility Just Getting Started

&gt; The market's day-to-day volatility has picked up in September after experiencing more stable trading action during the summer months. This is not out of the ordinary. Historically, the most volatile time of the year for stocks has been between September and early November. You can see this in the chart below that shows the average absolute daily percentage change for each trading day of the year beginning on the first trading day of January through the last trading day of December. As shown, daily volatility is very consistent around the +/-0.70% level over the first eight months of the year, but then it starts to pick up beginning in September until it reaches a peak during the first week or two of November. From there, the holiday season takes over and daily volatility plummets right through the end of the year. As shown in the chart, unfortunately we've still got a ways to go to get to the top of the volatility mountain, so make sure you've got your climbing gear ready for the next six to eight weeks!

&gt; # Keeping Tabs On High Frequency Growth

&gt; The week ended September 11th showed a sharp decline in our index of weekly GDP versus the year before. As shown, our index can be quite volatile, but it does do a decent job tracking the general trajectory of GDP. Since peaking at an implied growth rate of +0.9% YoY on July 10th, our index has slid to -2% YoY, the lowest reading since mid-June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091820-Weekly.png))**

&gt; Taking a look at another tracker of short-term economic growth, below we show Weekly Economic Index data updated by the New York Fed each week. After decelerating sequentially YoY for the week ended September 4th, the WEI reported sequential YoY growth slower once again in the week ended September 11th. We also show what each high frequency tracker implies about quarterly growth. As shown, our tracker has consistently implied a higher quarterly growth rate than the Weekly Economic Index, and official data for the last two quarters. That said, Q3 is tracking at least 20%, with upside to the high-20s as the US continues to rebound from COVID. This post was originally published in our post-market macro report -- The Closer -- last night.

&gt; # Sell(ing) Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur

&gt; As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.” It gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

&gt; The basis for this, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,” pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away – and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

&gt; Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 100 Stock Trader’s Almanac). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/08c1da4f106eb00e65a4532c55dd8ea0/ad7e0851da5530c5-bd/s1280x1920/744427ad7335745d917da73a6033df7c6d4fe9eb.jpg))**

&gt; Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 59% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 6.7%.

&gt; This year the high holidays commence on Friday eve, September 18, and end Monday September 28 with Yom Kippur just before Octoberphobia. The current news flow already has folks selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays, quite possibly setting up the market for further declines.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 down 24 of 30 during week after September options expiration, average loss 0.95%

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. The week after September options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 30 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are in the following sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –1.01%, S&amp;P 500 –0.95%, NASDAQ –0.95% and a sizable –1.42% for Russell 2000. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter.

Stocks dropped again today, closing out a volatile week on a sour note. Tech stocks continued pulling back, with many notable stocks breaking through well-established supports. In spite of the Fed’s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. 

This week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&amp;P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.

After a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, “At this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4”

Economic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that’s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. 

Confidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus. Economists and politicians agree that more stimulus is needed to boost consumer confidence and provide much-needed support to cash-strapped families and small businesses.

The firm's technology has been used in popular mobile games such as Pokémon Go, and console or PC games created by Ubisoft, EA, Tencent, and others.  

**Why? -** CEO John Riccitello and CFO Kimberly Jabal took an unorthodox approach to the offering. Instead of leaning on investment banks to determine and control the pricing of the offering, Riccitiello made the final call based upon bids prior to the offering. 

**The Takeaway:** IPO's have been the talk of the town this week! After a stellar debut from Snowflake, Unity looks to capitalize on a tech-hungry market. Unity currently has 716 customers with accounts over $100,000 annually. In addition, they have closed the gap on their net loss from 2019 to 2020 by approximately $13M. ",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,528155,public,confidence,self,Unity IPO: Getting a look into gaming - Bite-Size News &amp; Discussion,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ivcl5t/unity_ipo_getting_a_look_into_gaming_bitesize/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The third thing we are doing is that we've built our own B2 social media network, B2SN, to distribute our content,"" said Bell, noting that the company has also developed their own production division, which creates all of the Company's content for B2SN.

""How is your business addressing the pandemic?"" asked Jolly. Bell explained that the early challenges of the pandemic lead the Company to evolve their business model. ""We pivoted to have limited crowds attend our events, and then turned on all of our pay-per-view,"" explained Bell, sharing that sports fans are increasingly looking towards pay-per-view options given the current environment. ""There's a huge demand for our type of very unique content,"" said Bell.

""This has really changed the way people consume sports,"" said Bell. ""We're delivering it right to their screens, and people are paying us to deliver the content we create,"" he continued. ""It has actually pivoted quite nicely and it's growing rapidly, so it's pretty exciting.""

In case you haven't read the article above, a internet provider in Australia has offered it's customers to purchases $1 stocks (minimum of 2000 stocks and a maximum of 10000). Now I'm not about to ask if this will make me money, because there is no way to know what will happen in the future. What I am asking is if my understanding of the stock market is correct or naive.

Let's say I buy 2000 stocks (whatever that is) for $2000. Then over 2-5 years the company grows to become one of the largest internet providers in Australia. This means the company net worth increase. If the net worth increase, the worth of my stocks increase, say from $1 each (which I bought them for) to $1.20. This means if I sell my stocks now, it'll be worth $2400. That means I have made a profit of $400. Is that right?

 Is that how the stock marker works? And does that mean to make lots of money you have to spend lots of money? Like it's not like my $2000 can become $5000? That's too much of a gain right? Or is it possible if the company becomes successful.

The reason I am here is just that I considered to get into the market so that I can make some extra money while I study as a veterinarian and work part time as a cashier. But if the profit is only 20% then the risk is too high, but if the profit is 150% Then we're talking.

Mobile carrier AT&amp;T is looking into offering wireless phone plans, which would be partially subsidized by advertising as soon as next year or in the year after, according to a Reuters interview with CEO John Stankey.

AT&amp;T’s ([**T**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/t/forecast)) CEO said “ I believe there’s a segment of our customer base where given a choice, they would take some load of advertising for a $5 or $10 reduction in their mobile bill.” Meanwhile, AT&amp;T has a planned launch of an ad-supported version of its video-streaming service HBO Max next year. Stankey believes that it will serve as a “foundational element” to the new phone plans.

However, as AT&amp;T’s advertising marketplace uses data from outside the carrier, Stankey is doubtful if the company can use external data for ads “in perpetuity.” The move could raise privacy concerns as to how tech giants use their information, according to the report. ([See T stock analysis on TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/t/stock-analysis)).

On August 31, Scotiabank analyst [Jeff Fan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/jeff-fan) downgraded AT&amp;T stock to Sell from Hold and lowered the price target to $30 (3% upside potential) from $34. The analyst said that the stock “may look attractively valued on an absolute basis and relative to its peers, \[but\] we think it will remain cheap until T can stem its wireless share loss and/or undergo a significant structural change to its asset mix, which is currently burdened by the exposure to DirecTV.”

Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 7 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell.

The Dallas-based phone and media giant says it will try to cut its operational emissions through initiatives such as the use of more renewable energy, buying hybrid vehicles and deploying efficiency measures. As a last resort, it will buy offsets for the emissions it can’t cut in order to reach net zero on two-thirds of its carbon output.

Most of us came across the ""log function"" during school days and, back then, you were probably wondering why you should even bother knowing about it. Time has come to appreciate its value in finance
Money bag

In the realm of asset pricing, it is handy and natural to use the logarithm of the price. Indeed it guarantees that price never go below zero.

The other main benefits of log returns derive from the properties of the logarithm function.

Let's dig into them


LOG-NORMALITY

The baseline model in financial theory assumes log-returns are normally distributed so that prices follow the log-normal distribution.

-&gt; Transposing the mathematics to a Gaussian distribution allows for simpler and more solvable equations.


RAW-LOG EQUALITY

When returns are very small (almost always true for short holding duration , such as daily returns) log-returns are comparable to raw returns.


TIME-ADDITIVITY

The major advantage of log-returns. It reduces the cumbersome product of returns to the difference between final and initial periods.


NUMERICAL STABILITY

Adding small numbers is very safe numarically, while multiplying is not and is subject to arithmetic underflow.


BIJECTIVITY

The logarithm is a bijective function (mapping the set of positive real numbers to the set of all numbers). Therefore log returns can easily be converted back to raw returns applying the exponential function.


But the reality in more complex

The Gaussian is just an approximation that comes at a cost: it underestimate extreme events and therefore risk.

It means that if the empirical distribution was indeed a Gaussian, daily returns of ±10% would never happen.

During the company’s last earnings report, Disney said that the streaming platform has amassed over 60 million global subscribers. Assuming that U.S. households make up 50% of that total base (Disney has not yet broken out the exact number of U.S-based subscribers), 7Park’s data suggests that roughly 9 million users purchased the “Mulan” film for $30 a pop (29% of our estimated 30 million users.)

## Is SNOW Stock A Ten Bagger Stock In The Making?

Catching snowflakes is an enjoyable experience, but it can also make good money this week. By now we can conclude that 2020 has been a bumper year for [cloud stocks](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing/tech-stocks). Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK.A Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=BRK.A)) and Salesforce ([CRM Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=CRM)) backed Snowflake Inc. ([SNOW Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SNOW)) surged 112% to $253.93 after hitting a high of $319 during the first day of debut.

This came after many investors went scrambling for a slice of the hottest tech stock this year. The maker of the database program doubled its valuation during its first day of trading from about $33 billion to just under $71 billion, making it the biggest IPO ever for a software firm.

With Snowflake’s impressive growth track record and interest from Warren Buffett, investors might want to include SNOW stock in their list of [top tech stocks to buy](https://stockmarket.com/featured/top-3-tech-stocks-in-focus-after-tiktok-reaches-new-deal-2020-09-14) moving forward. Judging from its stellar performance during its first day of the public debut, there are good reasons for all the enthusiasm. But the big question here is, should investors chase SNOW stock at such a high valuation? Read on.

## Should Investors Buy Into Snowflake Stock When It’s Piping Hot?

Before deciding whether to invest in SNOW stock, let’s take a look at some numbers to see where the company stands. If you have read Snowflake’s S-1 filing, the first thing which probably caught your attention would be its ridiculous growth rates. Snowflake’s 133% growth over the six months of 2020 and 158% net retention rate are terrific, to say the least. After yesterday’s surge, Snowflake is trading at a whopping 175 times trailing-12-month sales, putting other [enterprise software stocks](https://stockmarket.com/featured/should-we-buy-these-enterprise-software-stocks-ahead-of-their-earnings-2020-08-24) to shame. However, with existing clients ramping up their spending on Snowflake’s service, the company may just grow into its valuation. What looks expensive right now might not look so bad in just a couple of years.

If you have been actively searching for the [best stocks to buy](https://stockmarket.com/featured/are-these-the-best-stocks-to-buy-as-the-streaming-market-grows-2020-09-12), you would know that cloud stocks have soared to all-time high valuations. So, you could say that Snowflake has come to the market right when it is the hottest. But guess what, it didn’t melt in the face of the heat. If anything, it has gotten investors all the more excited. But if you are looking for a quick flip, tread carefully. On the other hand, if you’re planning to buy and hold it for the long term, then, by all means, feel free to take a chance at this red hot company.

## What Does Snowflake Actually Do?

Well, I’ll admit I am not an IT expert here. Snowflake is a cloud-native data warehouse provider. That sets it apart from the likes of Oracle Corp. ([ORCL Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=ORCL)). Snowflake offers database solutions for storing data and running queries on those data. Unlike the competition, users do not have to pay upfront, and services can be scaled up or down in a flexible manner.

This flexibility extends to its pricing as well. The firm boasts 3,100 customers, 56 of which were each responsible for generating around $1 million in revenues within a 12-month period. While big cloud providers like Amazon.com Inc.([AMZN Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AMZN)), Microsoft Corp ([MSFT Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=MSFT)), and Alphabet Inc. ([GOOGL Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=GOOGL)) have similar offerings, Snowflake prides itself as being the standalone company which can run on all of these cloud platforms.

## Cloud Stocks Could Still Move Higher Despite The Recent Pullback

In the cloud space, the pandemic has acted more as a tailwind than a headwind. There’s a long list of cloud stocks that have been dominating the market of late. No doubt, unless there’s a safe and effective vaccine, chances are today’s new normal will stay for some time. For this reason, the recent pullback could provide opportunities for a quick flip. If you, like many other industry experts, believe that the cloud space will continue to thrive even after the pandemic, you should pay close attention to this space over the next decade.

Now, Snowflake’s IPO might have overshadowed JFrog’s IPO ([FROG Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=FROG)). JFrog makes software for developers. It’s worth noting that FROG stock has leaped 47% to $64.79 after hitting a high of $77 per share during its intraday.

JFrog stock raised $504 million. Both SNOW stock and FROG stock priced above their expected ranges. Meanwhile, Tencent-backed online real estate platform KE Holdings ([BEKE Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=BEKE)) which debuted last month, also broke out yesterday. The rising tide in the tech space seems to lift all boats.

## Bottom Line

It’s not always the case that IPOs open for trading much higher than the offering price. Of course, Snowflake’s credibility is further boosted with Warren Buffett and Salesforce as their shareholders. But investors shouldn’t be buying SNOW stock merely because they are. So when the stock eventually takes a breather, you won’t be panic selling which would result in losses. Instead, take some time to study the company’s product, the potential, and scalability of the business to make a more informed decision. ",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,527252,public,confidence,self,Snowflake IPO: Here’s What You Need to Know Before Buying SNOW Stock,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/iuja90/snowflake_ipo_heres_what_you_need_to_know_before/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Believe in it"" or not, the consumer's lifestyle has changed. Below I lay out my reasons why $ACI is the most obvious undervalued stock on Wall Street.




1. $ACI is the 2nd largest grocery chain on the continent, but trades at a P/E multiple of 5.45x, less than HALF of it's top two competitors ($KR = 12.19x &amp; 11.06x)



2. Same store sales have increased for 10 straight quarters (meaning they were gaining market share even BEFORE Covid)



3. Many people cite debt as a concern, yet fail to mention that under the new CEO (2018) debt has been cut by BILLIONS (with a 'B) bringing their Debt/Equity ratio to a nice 1.10...smart dude. It also helps that federal interest rates are at/near 0% and $ACI just restructured their remaining long term debt to take advantage of it.




4. The company recently went public (Late June). Of the 18 analysts that cover the stock, 78% have a BUY rating. Jim Cramer (Mad Money host) recommended buying under $24. The average price target is $19.




5. $ACI is the #1 or #2 chain in 15/16 of the major cities in which it operates. 




6. The popular PEG ratio used to measure a companies growth vs their earnings multiple currently sits at 0.40. To put that into perspective, a PEG ratio of 1.0 indicates that the price of the stock accurately reflects it's growth rate. 0.5 is considered VERY undervalued. 




7. We're in a pandemic. Going to restaurants is a pain in the ass, people are on tight budgets, and many people are working from home. YoY sales the last few quarters are up roughly 26%. Although we won't be in a pandemic forever, working from home is a trend that will definitely stick, meaning more people will at LEAST be eating breakfast at home....and likely lunch. You buy those products at a grocery store.



8. Digital sales for $ACI were up over 274% during the height of the pandemic. Their delivery app has a near 5 🌟 rating. Good apps = sticky customers. 




9. The CEO (and some other top executives) purchased shares in mid August at/near $14.74. Insiders don't purchase shares to lose money.



10. They plan on paying a 2.5% dividend based off of their IPO price right out of the gate. At $16/share, that means a $0.40 dividend /share right out of the gate. I'm sure it helps to to be a company that's been around over 80 years.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,527032,public,confidence,self,The Most Obvious Undervalued Stock on Wallstreet,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/iubqma/the_most_obvious_undervalued_stock_on_wallstreet/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stocks opened high but erased their gains and turned mixed as investors digested the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) September monetary policy statements and remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed signaled that interest rates would remain at near-zero through 2023 in an attempt to buoy the virus-stricken economy.

In their report, the FOMC once again reiterated that ‘the path of economic recovery will depend significantly on the course of the virus \[coronavirus\]”. They said, “The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term”.

On a positive note, the Fed’s outlook for economic contraction was less dire compared to previous months, suggesting a rising level of optimism in the Fed’s projections. The Fed forecast a 3.7% contraction in real GDP and an unemployment rate of 7.6% by the end of the year, versus its June outlook for a 6.5% GDP contraction and jobless rate of 9.3%. The Fed also added that it would continue its current Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases “at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.”

Once again, in his statements Powell urged lawmakers to pass more fiscal stimulus to provide direct support to small businesses and households, stating that the initial faster-than-expected economic recovery could be threatened with the enhanced unemployment numbers as direct support measures expire. Both Powell and other FOMC members have repeatedly underscored the importance of both robust monetary and fiscal policy to economic recovery. Powell said” “The people who worked in those service jobs, particularly the entry-level, lower-paid workers, they're the ones who are most vulnerable. And those are the ones who we really need to look out for both through Fed policy, which will be there to support the economy — but also through fiscal policy \[provided by congressional lawmakers\]”.

**Highlights**

* Facebook (FB) finished the day 3.24% down after it was announced that Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will file an antitrust lawsuit against the company and that Kim Kardashian will boycott FB and IG as a protest to their mishandling of info.
* Kodak (KODK) stock spiked after an independent law firm found that no laws were broken when the US government gave the company the loan

Microsoft (MSFT) right now has a market cap of $1.6 trillion, about 10 times current year estimated revenues. Were it valued like Snowflake, it would be worth $17 trillion,
* Shares of Spotify (SPOT) fell as much as 7% after Apple (AAPL) announced a bundled plan for all its services that lowered the cost of Apple Music subscriptions.
* Inovio (INO) has been on an absolute tear recently, with the stock price up 35% today (77% up in the week).

I had previously been swing trading stocks so I had a couple years of experience before that, but the leverage and potential returns that options provided really piqued my interest. After it was all said and done, I lost almost $20,000 buying options. After realizing that someone was getting all of this money I was losing, I learned about option selling and haven’t looked back since.

I recently posted my YTD performance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/i0mkv3/10k_to_100k_in_5_months_23k_in_deposits_and_67k/), and received a lot of questions about how I did it. My strategy changed over time, but I first started with credit spreads, which may be applicable to more people since it’s a strategy that works with smaller accounts too. I got a lot of questions about how I played credit spreads and it’s tough to completely explain what I do through a comment here and a comment there so I created this guide explaining my exact approach to trading credit spreads.

#Part One: The Basics

So what is a spread? A high level conceptual explanation is that you’re essentially betting on a stock to finish above or below a certain price upon expiration. One of the advantages here is that you can set this number out of the money, so if a stock is trading at $100, you can bet that it’ll remain below $110 by a certain date. This is a bearish position, so if you’re correct and it goes up, you’ll make max profit. The catch though is that even if you’re wrong, you basically have a 10% downward cushion before you start to lose any money. So the easiest way to describe it is a strategy that lets you make money if you’re right, but also make money if you’re slightly off.

How does it work? So in the above example, if we were bullish on a stock we would open what’s called a put credit spread. We could set it up where we sell a 110c for a credit of $1.50, and buy a 115c for a debit of $0.50. This means that in this transaction we receive $1.50, and pay $0.50 for a net credit of $1. That credit is your max profit on the play. If you’re familiar with options you’ll know that if the stock finishes at or below $110 upon expiration, both of these calls will be worthless. That’s great news for us because the long leg we bought (115c) for 0.50 will be a loss, but we’ll get to keep the full $1.50 from the short leg (110c) that we sold, resulting in us realizing our max gain on the trade of $1.

Why not just sell the 110c and collect the full $1.50? While it cuts into our profits, the reason we buy the 115c in this example for $0.50 isn’t to cut into our profits when we’re correct, but rather protect us when we’re wrong. If the stock in the example stays below $110, we’re good to go and we’ll hit max profit. But what if it goes to $120, $150, or something crazy happens and it hits $200. If the stock hits $150 upon expiration, that 110c that we sold for $1.50 will be worth $40, meaning that we’ll incur a $3,875 loss in pursuit of a $150 gain. We’ve seen crazy run ups from the likes of TSLA and ZM lately, and people who sold what we call “naked options” got absolutely killed. With our spread, yes our 110c will be worth $40 meaning we’re down $4,000 on that position, but the 115c we bought behind it will be worth $35 meaning we’re up $3,500 there for a net loss of $500. Additionally, we get to keep that $1.00 credit we received up front no matter what, so our loss with this spread is actually $500-$100=$400 as opposed to the $3,875 loss that we would’ve seen had we sold the 110c by itself. THAT is the value in selling a spread as opposed to a naked option.

Why are you multiplying everything by 100? Each options contract is worth 100 shares, so a contract that is trading for $1.50 actually costs $150 to purchase.

Another high level point I like to make is that there are really 5 different things that can happen when you make a play. Let’s say you think a stock will go up. It can (1) go up a ton and you’d be correct, (2) go up a little and you’d be correct, (3) trade flat and you’d be incorrect, (4), go down a little and you’d be incorrect, or (5) go down a lot and you’d be incorrect. With a bullish spread, you’d hit max profit on 4/5 , or 80% of the possible outcomes, whereas if you bought stock or purchased an option you’d only be profitable on (1) or (2). Obviously the actual outcomes are a little more complex, but for a base-level understanding of the advantages a spread provides, I think this is a good way to look at it.

So that’s the value of a spread. A lot of traders are introduced to option selling and are scared of the prospect of incurring a huge loss like we mentioned above, but using credit spreads is a great way of receiving the benefits that selling has to offer while limiting a lot of the risks. So let’s move onto actually opening a spread.


#Part Two: Making the Trade
So for actually opening a spread up, we have a four-step approach we take: Pick a Stock Pick a Direction Pick a Strike Price Execute the Trade

**1: Picking a Stock:**

One of the most important things I tell people is to trade what you know. I have a watchlist of 25-30 stocks that I watch and get familiar with during the day. That way if I recognize a good opportunity, I’ll have a decent base of knowledge to rely on to make what I feel is a smart play. It’s super easy to get caught up in the “stock of the week” and try to jump in on a play because a ticker is in the news. If you’re not familiar with a stock, don’t trade it.

For this example (the one used in the video), Wayfair was trading in a 195-210 range for a little bit and then had a big day where it broke up out of that range and up towards $220. This was an unusual move that I noticed since it was on my watchlist, so I decided to make a play.

STOCK: WAYFAIR

**2: Picking a direction:**

So if we look at Wayfair’s YTD chart, it has exploded this year. A clear upward trend, but a recent trend that I noticed from following the stock was that every time it broke out like this, there would be a little bit of a pullback afterwards. Additionally, I felt the stock was overvalued on a fundamental basis (had a negative book value at the time of the trade) so I wanted to play this stock back down. This is probably the quickest and easiest step of the four, since you’ll likely already have an opinion on most of the stocks that you follow.

DIRECTION: DOWN

**3:Picking a Strike Price:**

So we know that we’re going to be playing Wayfair back down, but now the question is what spread are we going to set up to do that. In this example Wayfair was trading at $218.42 at the time that we decided to make this trade. In the video we illustrate a trading channel that Wayfair was at the top of. It was also approaching the ATH of $221.54. A lot of the time that will act as resistance for a stock, meaning it’ll bounce down off of it. So in order to give ourselves a bit of a cushion we decided to set our short leg at 222.50, meaning that we’re playing the stock to stay below $222.50 by the end of that week.

So with this play it means in plain English that if we’re correct and the stock goes down, we hit max profit. But if we’re wrong and it goes up, we still have a $4.08 cushion before we’re not hitting max profit anymore. So we could be a little wrong, have the stock go up a few dollars, and still walk away with max profit.

STRIKE PRICE OF SHORT LEG: $222.50

**4: Executing the Trade:**

I’ll be the first to tell you that when I started trading spreads I didn’t realize you could open both legs of the spread at was. I was stupid. I would like to think I’m at least a little bit smarter now. If you look at the options screen for most brokers, you’ll just see single legs. Switching over to “vertical” allows you to set up the entire spread in one trade. If you use something like RH, there’s a feature that allows you to select multiple options, so you’ll select the one you wish to sell (short leg) and the one you wish to buy (long leg).

In this example we selected the 222.5/225c spread, meaning that we sold the short leg of 222.5 and the long leg of 227.5. The net credit was 1.45, which is our max gain on the trade. A wider spread gives a larger credit but also increases max loss. This is a $5 wide spread but we could have made it a tighter spread with a $2.5 width. Typically the best risk to reward ratio is on the tightest spreads, but a slightly wider spread will raise your breakeven price and studies have shown that it actually results in better expected value long term.

Circling back to the credit we received of $1.45, this means that our max profit was $145 and our max loss was $355 for each spread that we sold. We know that because our broker tells us that, but a quick way to calculate it is the width of the spread minus the credit. A $1.45 credit on $5 wide spread means a $5-$1.45=$3.55 max loss.

When I evaluate trades like this I look for a max profit to max loss ratio of 1:2 to 1:4. Based on different scanners I’ve seen, the best expected values tend to fall on spreads within that risk/reward ratio. The ratio on this trade is 1:2.44.

So we put our order in for a credit of $1.45, it filled, and now we get to sit back and watch. Sometimes your order won’t fill right away. In fact, most of the time it won’t fill right away. It’s important to be patient with your fill price and not chase it downwards. We want the highest credit possible. So if the credit on these spreads dropped to 1.30 when I was trying to place an order, it usually isn’t a great idea to drop my order price down to 1.30 just to get a fill. The only time I would recommend that is if you’re trying to open a spread right before the market closes. Otherwise, hang tight. Patience pays.

#Part 3: Managing the Trade

So now that we’ve made the trade, it’s time to manage it. In my opinion one of the best parts about trading spreads is that they don’t require active management. You get to sit back and watch the price. Once the trade has been opened, which is also quick, it takes very little effort.

So with the Wayfair example we used, our analysis turned out perfectly, as Wayfair touched the ATH and dipped back down to end the week safely at $214. We hit max profit on that trade, but what if the trade goes against us? That’s what we’ll take a look at in this section.

One thing we didn’t address in part two is when to open the trade. We like opening spreads on Mondays and Tuesdays, and monitoring them during the week. This is the part of my strategy that is a little bit controversial, as there is a (legitimate) school of thought that selling spreads about 45 DTE is better value. I like that idea and if you would rather do that then absolutely go for it. It’s important to trade what you’re comfortable with. All of the lessons in here still apply to that strategy. With that said though, I stick with the weekly strategy of opening them at the beginning of the week and look to close them throughout the week.

The way I see it, your % of max profit should be the metric you’re looking at when deciding what to do with a spread. Divided up equally, that means if you progressed through the week to max profit in a linear fashion, you would be at 20% of max profit on Monday, 40% on Tuesday, and so forth. A good rule of thumb I use is that if you’re ever on the fence about whether or not to close something out, do so if your return exceeds the linear return for that day of the week. The market can move quickly and I’ve had several times where I have regretted not closing a spread out. It’s important to take profit.

Another thing I’ll add to this is that this weekly strategy gets a little risky on Thursday afternoon headed into Friday. If your spread is remotely close to being in the money on Thursday afternoon, close it out. Now that I type that out I realize that may all sound a little convoluted, but it’s better visualized in the video I’ve linked for this section.

Now let's get into what happens if a trade really starts to move against you. With the strategy we use there are really two options: (1) Close the trade for a loss and move on, or (2) Roll the strikes higher.

The first option is pretty self explanatory, but a quick note I want to add here is that you can have a stock move way against you but still be able to close the trade for less than max loss. The example I use in my video is I played FB earnings, thought it would go down, but it shot way above my spread and well into max loss territory. We opened a 245/247.5c spread for a credit of $0.54. FB was reporting earnings on a Thursday night and we sold this spread that expired the following day, so there wasn’t a ton of time to manage it. Long story short, FB killed earnings and shot up to $256 that morning. Really not a prayer that it would come back down to the spread I opened by the end of the day. But despite the fact that this trade went way against us and we had almost no time to manage it since it was a Friday play, we were still able to close out for a debit of $1.90. Yes that’s a loss of $1.36 per spread, but we SAVED an additional $0.60 cent loss by avoiding a max loss debit of $2.50. That’s another benefit of spreads.

Let’s talk about option two. This is the best option to use if you’re confident that you’re correct about the ultimate price action on a stock, but you need a little extra wiggle room on the trade. For this example we’ll look at a TSLA call spread that I opened. TSLA was trading at $1542 after an incredible run, so I figured I would play it below 1600 with a 1600/1610c spread that offered a credit of $2.52. As is the theme with this section, TSLA exploded the following morning (Tuesday) and went all the way up to $1794 at one point. My spread was literally almost $200 out of the money. One of the biggest possible moves against myself that I had ever seen. Despite this crazy move, it was only Tuesday and we were able to close the first spread for a debit of only $5.25 (as opposed to a $10 max debit). We opened 6 of these off the bat so this was a loss of $1638. From there we “rolled” our strikes higher, opening 10 1750/1760c spreads for a credit of $3.45. So the closing and subsequent opening of a spread like we did here is what we are referring to when we say we “rolled the strikes higher”.

By the end of the week TSLA had finally crashed a bit and it finished at $1506. This meant the second of spreads we opened were easily max profit. And while we lost $1,638 on the first set of spreads we opened here, we profited $3,450 on the second set of spreads so we were able to still finish the week with a $1,812 profit on TSLA. The funny thing with this one is that the original spread would have hit max profit since it dropped all the way back down to 1500, but we would have had the same result had TSLA finished anywhere below 1750.

Rolling the strikes higher gave me extra breathing room and turned a potential disaster into a profitable trade. One thing I’ll add though is that with this method you do run the risk of increasing your potential max loss. Because of that, I’ll only roll my strikes higher ONCE. Anything past that is chasing a losing trade. If I roll my strikes higher and it’s still going against me, I’m at the point where I need to accept the fact that I don’t fundamentally understand a stock as well as I thought I did and move on. There is always another trade out there.

The final point I’ll add to this is ALWAYS CLOSE OUT YOUR SPREADS. The only time I’ll let a spread expire worthless is if my spread is OTM by a crazy amount and it would quite literally take a historic after-hours move on Friday to take me back ITM. Other than that, close your spreads out. Even if it’s just for a $0.05 debit. It may seem annoying but I’ll tell you why in the following section.

#Part 4: Additional Risks and Considerations

I will start this section by saying I’ve never been impacted by any of the following risks, but it’s important to be aware of 100% of the possible outcomes of your trade before you enter it. They’re infrequent but this really wouldn’t be a comprehensive guide if I omitted them. They are as follows: (1) Early Assignment, (2) Dividend Risk, (3) Pin Risk.

**1: Early Assignment:**

The best way to start this section is by talking about why your max loss is actually your max loss. We know it’s quickly calculated as the width of your spread minus the credit, but why is that?

Let’s use a 110/115c spread as an example. We’ll say we received a credit of $1. We know that if the stock finishes anywhere below 110 then both legs are worthless and we’ll hold onto that $1 credit. But what happens if we’re in a max loss position. Let’s say the stock finishes at $120.

In this situation the short leg (110c) we sold would be worth $10 (120-110), meaning that we would owe $1,000 on that position. The long leg we bought would be worth $5 (120-115), meaning we are holding a position worth $500. The net effect is a $500 loss, but remember that’s netted against the $100 credit you received, so it’s a max loss of $400. That math checks out as the width of the spread is $5, the credit is $1, so the max loss is 5-1=$4*100=$400.

So that’s how it works upon expiration. But lets say this position moved against you, you still have a few days until expiration, but the stock is at $120. Since there are a few days left, you probably could close the contract for a debit of $3.50 rather than the max loss debit of $5. However, since your short leg is ITM the person you sold the option to may choose to exercise their option. As a result, that would require you to take on a short position of $110*100=$11,000 per contract sold. You may not be able to afford to cover that, or your broker may not let you hold that position. So what happens is your long leg gets exercised as well resulting in you taking a max loss early. So while on paper you received a credit of $1 that could have been closed for a debit of $3.50 and your loss was only $2.50, early assignment results in you prematurely taking a max loss.

When does this happen? It typically doesn’t, since it requires the buyer sacrificing the remaining extrinsic value on the option, but it’s more likely with certain stocks. There are three different classifications of a stock that relate to it’s borrowing ability: Easy to Borrow (ETB), Hard to Borrow (HTB), and Not Available to Borrow (NTB). The harder a stock is to borrow, the more likely it is that a call is exercised early because it gives the buyer a way to acquire a stock which may not be available to them through their broker. So if you’re selling call spreads that are close to being ITM, make sure to check out the borrowing status of the stock.

**2: Dividend Risk:**

This risk relates to the first one discussed, as it’s just another way you risk early assignment. If a company is announcing a dividend, there will be something known as an “ex-div” date, which means that all shareholders as of that date are entitled to receive the divident, which will be distributed usually at a later date. Because of this, call buyers may exercise an out of the money call option in an effort to acquire those shares.

Remembering that exercising an option means that you sacrifice all remaining extrinsic value, another reason a buyer may exercise a call option before an ex-dividend date is that the value of the dividend announced is greater than the extrinsic value remaining in the option. Say a 100c is trading at $2 and the underlying (stock) is currently at 101. The extrinsic value is the value of the option in excess of what it would be worth upon expiration. So the extrinsic value in this situation is $1, since the 100c trading for $2 is just $1 in excess of the current strike price. If the company in question here announced a $2 dividend, an option buyer would likely exercise their call option because the $2 dividend is greater than the $1 of extrinsic value.

**3: Pin Risk:**

We know that if your spread finishes out of the money it’s a max gain and if both legs of your spread finish in the money it’s a max loss. But what happens when the price of a stock finishes between the two legs of your spread? Let’s take a look.

So using a 100/110c spread as an example, let’s say that the stock finishes at 105. Your long leg, which is there to protect you, is worthless so you wouldn’t exercise it. However the short leg at 100 that you sold will be exercised by the buyer since it’s ITM. As a result, you’re now short 100 shares at a price of 100 and you’ll be holding that position over the weekend. This can go both ways from here, but since we’re focused on risk let’s say that this stock you’re now short shoots up over the weekend and some sort of news/event brings it up to $120.

With this short position of 100 shares at $100 you’re borrowing $10,000 worth of stock. Now that the stock is worth $120 this position is now worth $12,000. Over the weekend you’ve sustained a $2,000 loss. If we received a credit of $3 when we opened this spread, we may have thought that our max loss was 10-3=$7*100=$700. Since we failed to close the spread out, this position has now resulted in a $2,000 loss net of the $300 credit that you received when you opened the position. So on a trade where you thought you could lose at most $700, you’re now down almost $2k.

I can’t repeat it enough, but THIS IS WHY WE CLOSE OUT SPREADS BEFORE EXPIRATION. That is the single most important takeaway I can give you here. Spreads are great since they’re defined risk and defined gain. When you’re buying options you have a defined loss but a potentially infinite gain. This can make it really easy to get greedy and I’ve seen countless traders lose big profits because they keep holding out for more. When you have a defined gain and defined loss it makes it easier to make smart decisions, take profits, and continuously build on those profits over time.

That was an enormous wall of text but I hope it helps explain, from a base level, what spreads are and how they work. Switching from buying options to selling options has dramatically changed my performance in the market so I hope sharing this can do the same for someone else.

Prices Jumped on the minutes but I read them as bearish.  

\&gt;  The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. 

Covid and the economy are linked.  

\&gt;   The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. 

They are saying they are not expecting things to get any better in the near term.  

\&gt;  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. 

They are also starting to get concerned about inflation.  

I also don't understand how they can have maximum employment as a metric target, when it is so dependent on international trade, health care, and so many other factors out of their control.  They could never raise interest rates ever again, in certain circumstances.

I can understand someone who starts a business from scratch. Build a prototype, then get outside investors (or bank debt) and try to scale up while having limited liability as a business corporation.

**Decoupling the Market from Economic Reality - The Status Quo**

Let's keep this short but make it clear: most people (whether financial analyst or retail investor) agree that stock prices (especially those of big tech companies) are inflated and widely overpriced. The COVID-19 pandemic caused economic lockdowns in most countries of the world, which in turn decreased their GDP while boosting jobless numbers. Yet,  the stock market is at all time highs, with the NASDAQ-100 being around 20% above pre-COVID levels. In the past two weeks we observed a 10% correction that predominantly hit tech stocks.

Bulls justifying this market direction with stimulus/QE from the FED, as well as with a lack of different lucrative investment options apart from the stock market.

**The Plague of Retail Investors - Recent Changes in Market Participation**

The sharp decline in stock market prices back in march brought a lot of new people to the stock market. People that do not have financial backgrounds and do not apply fundamental analysis before deciding on whether, and if yes, which stock to buy. They rather follow the broader sentiment of other investors and trust in brand names they are aware of (independent of the stock price). In my opinion, this is exactly this phenomenon that allows stocks like APPL or TSLA to climb higher and higher, even though if analyzing their numbers, no events/developments in the next 10 years could justify the price people are willing to pay for these companies.

**An Objective Analysis - Technicals and Quantitative Indicators**

I'm a machine learning engineer working for an electricity provider in Germany. While my job is to forecast electricity prices and trade with energy in real-time settings, in my free-time I'm modeling the stock market using different approaches and algorithmic methods. While I'm not claiming to be able to reliably forecast stock movements (probably nobody can) all of my models (time-series model on the major indexes and several regression models build upon different feature sets such as market sentiment, quantitative metrics, as well as political and environmental news) agree on a vast selloff in september.  
Besides this personal analysis for which I cannot provide real proof, most of the common quantitative measures (GDP related ratios, P/E averages, ...) and rations point to a highly overvalued market that needs to be aligned with reality.

**A Subjective Analysis - Theoreticals and Logical Indicators**

Apart from quantitative indicators that clearly speak for a sharp market decline, from a logical/theoreitcal point of view, optimism - as the major driver of this market - has it's limits. As Benjamin Graham already said, the higher they go, the harder they fall. I mean, people pumping up stocks because of stock-split announcements and the anticipation that clueless retail investors will buy the stock even more because they think it is on discount after the split went through, is an indicator for itself, that this market cannot be sustainable and is driven by blind and unjustified optimism. People no more think and assess stocks in absolute but merely in relative numbers. If a stock has fallen 3% the only logical response is to buy the dip, which is a good concept per se, but it needs to be evaluated how large the dip needs to be to justify buying an asset.

Looking at the bigger picture, we also need to take into account that we are in the longest bull run in the history of the market. This means that big players are sitting on immense amounts of profits. Once  they realize/secure their gains (like they did back in march when uncertainty of COVID developments was very high), the market will tank, which in turn will panic aforementioned retail investors and in combination is going to create heavy selling pressure which will snowball itself into an unstoppable avalanche.

**The Political Uncertainty**

While I'm not a supporter of Trump at all, I think market-wise he is a blessing. With an increasing numbers of indicators pointing to an end of his regime, I think market makers and big players will anticipate exactly this, and are going to gradually moving out their money in the upcoming \~6 weeks, depending on the election forecasts - which will create further selling pressure and bearish sentiment among investors.

**TL;DR** 

I think this market is driven by anti-rational optimism that will come to an end really soon. A wise man once said: *The intelligent investor is a realist, that sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.* For me it was about time to sell to what are IMHO optimists - namely the people that are still buying/holding at these price levels. I for myelf will move my money into physical real-estate, until the market will drop to a point at which I feel comfortable putting money into stocks again.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,526430,public,confidence,self,Market Sell-Off September?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/itsh3z/market_selloff_september/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have been permanently banned from participating in r/NikolaCorporation. You can still view and subscribe to r/NikolaCorporation, but you won't be able to post or comment.

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/NikolaCorporation by replying to this message.

Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

for ""Proof - For those that believe.""

For those that believe in NKLA I think you should show proof. Do some screenshots and show the shares or calls/long you are doing. The calls are insanely cheap right now so would be no reason, even if you want to play safe with the stock you get a great buy in price right?

So if you really believe in NKLA and stand by it like you are saying than do what others are doing and showing that believe it is not a great company or maybe something much worse by taking up short positions and posting the details of it.

I think this could be valuable for this sub whichever way it goes. Either it goes in one way kind of aligned with the vibe of this sub or it goes the other, so why not?

Look forward to seeing more

The amount of funds is still small and has not been allocated as a bottom position. In the next three to five years, it will be a relatively certain event for foreign capital to increase the allocation of the Chinese market.

&amp;#x200B;

The Shanghai Securities News quoted him in a forum on Wednesday as saying, “What international investors value when entering a market is the relevance of this market to other markets. The lower the relevance, the more effective the global allocation. High, can effectively play the role of risk diversification.""

&amp;#x200B;

Liu Song believes that in the current market with great uncertainty, the only certainty is to find different investment targets to diversify risks. Investors all over the world hope to find a relatively high-yielding market. Currently, interest rates in the US and European markets are extremely low, while Chinese government bonds still have a yield of about 3%. This is also very attractive to overseas investors. force.

&amp;#x200B;

He also pointed out that the current Chinese capital market is becoming more and more market-oriented in terms of risk control, business, systems, and various mechanisms, and this increase in the degree of marketization also provides confidence for foreign investors to vigorously deploy the Chinese market.

&amp;#x200B;

The 10-year treasury bond yield in the inter-bank bond market, which has attracted much attention from overseas institutions, has recently risen to around 3.1%, and the five-year treasury bond has also reached around 3%.

&amp;#x200B;

In April this year, China lifted the restrictions on the proportion of foreign shares held by public fund companies, and Lubomai and BlackRock took the lead in submitting applications for public fund licenses. In early September, Xinhua reported that BlackRock Fund Management was approved to be established in Shanghai, making it China's first wholly foreign-owned public fund company.

Better-than-expected earnings from FedEx and Adobe after the bell boosted sentiment. FedEx released a blowout quarter with earnings $2.18 per share above analyst estimates, fueled by the e-commerce boom. The shipping company rallied more than 9% in extended trading. Adobe jumped 2% after hours.

Technology stocks continued their broad based rally. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2%, bringing its week to date gain to more than 3%. The technology heavy index dipped in correction territory last week and suffered its worst weekly performance since March.

“Optimism is being supported by a continual flow of good economic news, healthy earnings news and the prospect of getting more comforting news from the Federal Reserve tomorrow suggesting they remain committed to letting the recovery run hot while continuing to provide supportive policies,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, told CNBC. 

Wednesday marks the second day of the Federal Reserve policy’s meeting, the first since Chairman Jerome Powell unveiled a policy shift toward greater tolerance of inflation, effectively pledging to keep interest rates low for longer. Investors widely expect the central bank to maintain is downbeat stance on the economy.

The Federal Open Market Committee will provide its quarterly update on its estimates for GDP, unemployment and inflation. The central bank could provide clearer guidance on what it will take to raise rates in the future.

“The Fed doesn’t like to be involved in politics, even though its inherently a political institution but two months before an election is a very difficult time to put your politics aside,” David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday. “You just have to expect that there’s going to be some thought to politics.

All I am asking is what process (from the very start to the very end) you go through when trying to find a good buy for your portfolio. Be as detailed as you want, I am very interested in knowing how the people of this subreddit go about investing.

I guess I'll go first as an example of what I am looking for:

1. I use stock screeners. The most important screener is ROIC &gt; 10%. I also use [stockrow](https://www.stockrow.com) as they have tonnes of accurate financial data that updates as often as the data does. I specifically look at ROIC (return on invested capital) because this, along with the reinvestment rate (the rate at which a firm takes earnings and spends it on capex and working capital to fund growth) is the most consistent method of forecasting growth in the company's future. Expected Growth = reinvestment rate × ROIC.

2. I look for a company with some history. This is mostly for the data, but also to make sure that (a) there is something that I can read up on for the firm and get a feel for the business, and (b) its trajectory is positive (i.e. stock price has been either flat or up over the last 5-10 years).

3. I also look for a company in a sector I understand. I am much more understanding of tech and utilities, than oil and financial. This step won't necessarily eliminate a stock, but it does make me more careful.

4. The most time-consuming step is the initial DCF analysis I do on the company. I do a [Damodaran-style](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastvalonline.htm) DCF because I think the man is brilliant, all his resources are, free, up, and available online, and I agree with all of his thinking. This process usually takes me 5-10 hours spread over a few days as I comb over a stock's 10-Ks and 10-Qs, and make adjustments to prices and rates. If I like what comes out of the analysis (a healthy upside &gt;20%), I continue. If I get mixed results (10-20% upside), I am more guarded, but move on to step 5. Obviously if I don't like the outcome (&lt;10% upside), I leave it alone.

5. If I have made it this far, I do a lot of reading about the company and its history, and read what its future prospects look like, and what management is like. Think of typical value-investing guidelines. I also take this phase to look at what others are saying.

6. I go back to my DCF analysis and make any necessary adjustments from what I have learned from step 5.

7. If I have a good upside, I enter the position.

I know I have a very detailed procedure, and I don't expect every answer to be like this, but I am interested in seeing what you all do. 

PS: I mainly index because if I can do something like this with free online resources and data, I can only imagine the data and resources available to the big wall street market moves.

I'm a day trader and I've been doing a lot of learning on technical analysis and studies to help me minimize risk and increase gains. Lately, I've been a little frustrated because no matter how much I learn, nothing feels or looks like the tight trade. Before anyone says that I should not trade with feelings, I know this. I try to see all the evidence that predicts the movement of a stock and make a move from it, but fear usually ends up wining and I miss out on the trade. Back on topic, I think I've hit a wall, and AMC today is the best example. And just to clarify, I had no stake in any of the two instances I'm going to point out. I'm just dumbfound and perplexed and want to understand.

[Chart](https://imgur.com/a/KvgSlx9)

Now, there are only two things i know about that could have predicted or called the rise I circled, but even then it feels like I'm missing more information, or rather, making a trade out of those two things alone seems very risky. The two things are: usually, when the MACD histogram goes ""dead"" for a while, the stock tend to go boom in either direction, but here the histogram wasn't even that dead. The only other thing is what appears to be a 3 bar play. Are there any other factors that I could have taken into account to predict such violent rise?

Now, regarding that thick yellow regression line I drew on the chart, how could I have seen such regression coming? Aside from the fact that that big previous jump in price had to be corrected, how could I have predicted that that's when it would fall?

""Predict"" is probably the wrong word but it's the best one I can think of right now. I appreciate any and all pointers. If all you feel like answering is a simple subject that i can do research on (i.e. technical analysis) I will very gladly take it and appreciate it.

**Summary**

The markets opened higher today, and traded mostly sideways, to show a bit of weakness towards the end of the session, but made a quick rebound 20 minutes before close to finish mostly green. The SPY was up 0.50%, the QQQ finished up 1.41%, and the DIA was even. In contrast to the unstoppable rally that the market has showcased in the last few months, we are now entering into consolidation territory.

In relation to another COVID-19 package, according to Yahoo, House Representative Nancy Pelosi has stated that the house will remain in session until lawmakers can deliver another round of relief. However, a report published today by Bloomberg that the FED’s main street lending program, which went live two months ago, and out of the $600B that was assigned, only $1.4 have been lent out under “onerous” terms.

APPL Apple Inc had its much anticipated #ApplEvent which had a muted impact on the stock price. Some highlights were that they unveiled new Ipads, a cheaper version of the Apple Watch, and announced a fitness service. TSLA Tesla Inc is set to have its Battery Day on September 22. In anticipation of the event Elon Musk has already tweeted that there will be many new and exciting things.

On another front, some wild news regarding EV company NKLA Nikola. There have been massive price swings, a deal announced with GM General Motors, then a report on NKLA fraud, a response from the CEO Trevor Milton, and now finally today a form-4 was published where Milton bought $1.3MM worth of shares.

In Europe, Germany is reporting good economic data. Spain is the first country to cross the 600k infection threshold. The UK is having problems with unemployment rising.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lately, a steady march of searing heat, ruinous floods, horrific wildfires, unbreathable air, devastating hurricanes and other climate-related calamities has been traversing our screens and wreaking havoc to national and local budgets. And we’re only at 1C of increased global temperature rise. Just imagine what 2C or 3C or 4C will look like, and how much it will cost.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The financial climate, it seems, has been* ***as unforgiving as the atmospheric one.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Climate change is already impacting or is anticipated to impact* ***nearly every facet of the economy****, including* ***infrastructure****,* ***agriculture****,* ***residential*** *and* ***commercial property****, as well as* ***human health*** *and* ***labor productivity****. Over time, if significant action is not taken to check rising global average temperatures, climate change impacts could impair the productive capacity of the economy and undermine its ability to generate employment, income and opportunity.*

&amp;#x200B;

Most articles give me elementary information, like ""earnings"" and ""supply and demand"". I was able to find some more info on Quora [here](https://www.quora.com/How-exactly-do-stock-prices-get-determined). Let me summarize my current understanding and ask for elaboration.

The price is determined by iterative trading rounds. Each round is as follows, and takes only seconds:

1) Collect all bids and asks.
2) Analyze and determine a price.
3) Execute trades.

Questions:

a) How was this done before computers? (Asking due to curiosity / the explanation may enlighten the process).
b) How is the price determined in Step 2? A statistical mean? Maximizing the number of transactions? Maximizing the number of shares traded?
c) What price is advertised on the ticker? When I sell CSGO items on Steam, I can select my exact asking price, which is relative to the current average. I have no such option with trading stocks (right?).
d) Speaking of Steam, they take a small cut of each transaction. I assume stock exchanges do the same thing for revenue?

What made the Cambridge, U.K.-based company so successful was its neutrality. As the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry, Arm licenses its technology to hundreds of companies, while competing with none of them. The Nvidia acquisition threatens this.

All major chipmakers are Arm customers and many of these companies, including Qualcomm Inc., Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., sell chips that compete directly with products from Nvidia.

If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \[1\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \[2\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \[3\].

What is packaging?

The  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\[4\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.

3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.

Chiplets

Chiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in  AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\[5\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s  CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \[6\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \[7\]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you  would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it –  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete  foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \[8\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.

Chiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.

3D stacking

In  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately.

3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 \[9\],  Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago \[10\], and  TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago \[11\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\[12\] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far  behind.\[13\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \[14\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \[11\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \[15\]while Intel’s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \[16\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon &lt;500mm2, it’s apparent  that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \[17\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance  Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \[10\] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic –  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.

After  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you  why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future  is promising is threefold.

1. Packaging  is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.
2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \[18\]\[19\] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely  that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.
3. Intel’s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors.

If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.

Semiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.

Strix Group (AIM: KETL) is the market leader in the design and manufacture of kettle safety controls. They produce mission-critical components for kettle OEMs. E.g. the part of the kettle that switches it off after it has boiled.

**The Market**

Strix currently controls 38% of its addressable market, with 61% market share in the regulated kettle markets. This makes them by far the biggest in the market giving strong EoS and a foothold to gain more market share.

The kettle market has currently only achieved 35% market penetration, with others using hobs/stoves to boil water. Market penetration is increasing, with more households, especially the US (which only has 13% current penetration), using kettles. This means that Strix’s addressable market is growing 5-7% a year. Huge growth opportunities.

The market is also fairly acyclical, with kettles being fairly cheap and (arguably) a necessity, an economic downturn shouldn’t be too bad for Strix.

**Economic Moat**

The decision to use a certain component supplier is rarely based on cost, but on the quality of their components. A kettle OEM would save very little by using a supplier other than Strix, but if the component broke/failed, the OEM’s reputation would be irreversibly damaged. Therefore, the best supplier is often chosen.

Strix has cultivated a brand based on quality and safety. It has NEVER had to recall a product. To put that in perspective, Strix estimates its products are used 1 billion times EVERY DAY, yet they have never needed a recall. This shows the quality of their products.

This branding works in two ways. Firstly, it means new competitors trying to enter the market have a difficult time – they have no track record, so it is hard to obtain new customers. Secondly, the risk/reward means that Strix customers are unlikely to switch to a competitor – they just don’t want to take such a huge risk for a low proportion of their costs.

Moreover, it has &gt;150 patents, meaning their products are hard to copy. Not the most necessary barrier, but useful to have. Strix spends 3-4% of sales on R&amp;D, ensuring it always has competitive products.

**Valuation and Metrics**

Market cap: £448.2m

Total Enterprise Value: £519m

EBITDA/Total Enterprise Value: 7% (this is fairly good, shows a decent price for what you’re buying). TEV/EBITDA – 14.27x.

EBIT Margin: 33.5% (very solid)

ROIC: 53% (This is mental, and I believe it is skewed by low amounts of equity on the balance sheet – should revert to closer to 30% over time).

Overall, the metrics show a profitable company trading at a good price.

**Final Verdict**

Strix Group is a profitable company trading at a decent price in a growing market with a huge economic moat. It should be able to keep growing its customer base and seize on the growing market, causing it to massively increase its market cap. Strix Group should be present in many portfolios, as it diversifies away from tech while being acyclical. This can be a hold for at least 5 years.

Stocks rose Monday as investors eyes newly announced mergers &amp; acquisitions, positive vaccine news, and a lowering coronavirus infection rate in hotspot states. Tech shares appear to be recovering, opening the day high before paring gains to finish mostly even.

Today it was announced Oracle (ORCL) made a deal with TikTok parent company ByteDance to become the company’s “trusted technology provider.” The new deal between TikTok and Oracle comes after Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) said Sunday that ByteDance had rejected its buyout offer. National Security Concerns: On Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he will be reviewing the proposed deal between ByteDance and Oracle this week. “I will just say from our standpoint, we’ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, that the phones are secure and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams,” Mnuchin said.

Elsewhere, NVIDIA (NVDA) announced it was purchasing Arm, semiconductor and software design company from SoftBank Group for $40 billion, the largest ever M&amp;A in the semiconductor industry. Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, said “ Uniting NVIDIA’s AI computing capabilities with the vast ecosystem of Arm’s CPU, we can advance computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, self-driving cars and robotics, to edge IoT, and expand AI computing to every corner of the globe. 

Gilead (GILD) announced it was acquiring biotech company Immunomedics (IMMU) for $21 billion. Immunomedics developed Trodelvy, an antibody-drug conjugate used to treat triple-negative breast cancer.

Alright, let's pick this apart a bit:

&gt; PHOENIX, September 14, 2020 — Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA) (“the Company”) today issued the following statement commenting on a false and defamatory report published September 10, 2020, by Hindenburg Research (“Hindenburg”):

&gt; Nikola believes that the Hindenburg report, and the opportunistic timing of its publication shortly after announcement of Nikola’s partnership with General Motors Co. and the resulting positive share price reaction, was designed to provide a false impression to investors and to negatively manipulate the market in order to financially benefit short sellers, including Hindenburg itself.

&gt; Nikola has contacted and briefed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding Nikola’s concerns pertaining to the Hindenburg report. Nikola intends to fully cooperate with the SEC regarding its inquiry into these matters.

K ... Not answering any of Hindenburg's 53 questions yet...

&gt; Nikola, an early-stage growth company, has been through extensive due diligence processes, starting with Bosch in 2017, Hanwha Group and ValueAct Capital in 2018, CNH Industrial N.V. in 2019, and VectolQ Acquisition Corp. and General Motors in 2020. Nikola remains laser-focused on laying the groundwork toward becoming the global leader in zero-emissions transportation. The Company continues to make significant progress on its strategic initiatives:

K ... still not addressing the issue, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt

&gt; Nikola Tre Semi-Truck Production: The Company **expects** the Nikola Tre semi-truck, a pioneer battery-electric semi-truck created in collaboration with IVECO through a joint venture established in 2019 for the short haul trucking sector, **to be ready for production and available to customers** by the fourth quarter of 2021. The Nikola/IVECO joint venture has enabled dedicated focus toward delivering the Tre in 2021. The Nikola Tre is a zero-emission semi-truck with over 720 kWh of battery and an approximately 300-mile range. (Photos from September 2020: Tre 1, Tre 2, Tre 3, and Tre 4.)

Nothing concrete there. Same old promises. Also those pics are the same ones posted on Twitter immediately after the report was issued which everyone picked apart saying they don't prove anything. This is nothing new and doesn't look like they are ""rolling off the line"" as Trevor claimed multiple times.

&gt; Nikola Two Hydrogen-Electric Powered Semi-Truck Development: During 2021, Nikola **will begin testing a pre-production** Nikola Two, a hydrogen-electric powered semi-truck for the medium and long-haul trucking sectors, with more than 1,000 horsepower and 2,000 ft. lbs. of torque. Anheuser Busch LLC previously announced its placement of an order for **up to** 800 trucks, with a prototype **to be delivered** by the end of 2021, **testing planned** for 2022, and a production version **expected** in the second half of 2023.

Begin testing, pre production, up to, to be delivered, testing planned, expected ... blah blah blah. All promises which NKLA has been making for ages and none of which have been fulfilled.

&gt; In November 2019, a fuel-cell electric driven Nikola prototype completed a zero-emission beer delivery for Anheuser-Busch on public roads while operating on hydrogen. (Anheuser-Busch video can be viewed here.)

""Fuel cell electric driven"" but ""operating on hydrogen"" ... which is it? I'm too lazy to look at the details of this right now but they might have a point here...maybe

&gt; Large Order for Electrified Refuse Truck: As previously announced, Nikola has received a minimum order of 2,500 electrified refuse trucks from Republic Services, Inc., with on-road **testing likely to begin** in early 2022 and full production deliveries **expected to begin** in 2023. (Read more in the Company’s press release.)

""likely to begin"" ... ""expected to begin"", again giving themselves an out to not keep these promises

&gt; Strategic Partnership with General Motors for Badger Pickup Truck: As announced last week, the Company has formed a strategic partnership with General Motors, under which General Motors will engineer, homologate, validate and manufacture Nikola’s Badger pickup truck, which will include variants with all-electric and hydrogen fuel cell powertrains. Badger production is **expected to start** in late 2022. (Read more in the Company’s press release.)

&gt; The Company also remains committed to achieving the following milestones: **announcement of a hydrogen station collaboration** by the end of 2020; substantial completion of Nikola's JV manufacturing facility in Ulm, Germany by year end 2020; and completion of Phase 1 of its greenfield manufacturing facility in Coolidge, Arizona by the fourth quarter of 2021.

Once again, empty promises. Nothing concrete, and they still haven't addressed anything anyone actually cares about.

&gt; Hindenburg Report

&gt; The report from Hindenburg, an activist short-seller financially motivated to manipulate the market and profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price, contains a number of false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s operations and multi-year, groundbreaking R&amp;D efforts. Among the starkest examples are the following:

&gt; Short Seller Mischaracterizes Quote by Bosch Employee: Following the publication of the short seller report, Bosch stated, “Specific instances in the [Hindenburg] report quoting a Bosch employee were taken out of context.” Bosch has also stated, “The employee spoke only about Bosch’s own plans for the IAA industry show and H2Haul project for the European Union.” Nikola and Bosch are aligned on the product roadmap for the Tre truck. The five trucks are currently being built and commissioned in Ulm, Germany, and are pre-production builds. Hindenburg either recklessly misunderstands or willfully misrepresents the vehicle pre-production process to fit its narrative.

This doesn't change the fact that Trevor lied multiple times saying that these trucks were ""rolling off the line"". 

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

K. 

&gt; Short Seller Alleges That Nikola Buys and Does Not Make Inverters In-House: In its report, **Hindenburg misrepresents that Nikola is claiming a third-party inverter is the Company’s own technology** by placing a sticker over the supplier’s name. At no time did Nikola state that the inverter on the prototype truck shown in the video was the Company’s or would be used in production. Nikola has been designing, engineering and working on its own inverters for quite some time. **The Company does use third-party parts in prototype vehicles, some of which may be subsequently swapped out for its own parts in production**. This is common practice among vehicle manufacturers and Nikola often blocks supplier names from the view of media and competitors. Every program is different as they require different specifications and validation.

a) Hindenburg isn't claiming that. They claimed (correctly) that Trevor implied repeatedly that they make everything themselves. this is well documented in the report with screenshots of Trevor's tweets. b) ""may be"" swapped out in production. Just lol. this is a cop out. 

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

K.

&gt; Short Seller Misrepresents Nikola’s Historic Position on Battery Technology: The short seller report claims that Founder and Executive Chairman Trevor Milton made false statements regarding the Company’s battery technology following the breakdown of its transaction discussions with ZapGo Ltd. In fact, the potential battery technology advancements are related to an ongoing confidential R&amp;D partnership with a leading academic institution, not ZapGo. The Company is excited about potential breakthroughs related to its next generation battery technology.

Meaningless. Hindenburg claimed (correctly) that Trevor DID NOT mention that talks broke down. In fact he kept pumping the idea on Twitter as if they haven't. Hindenburg asked who the leading academic institution is, but Trevor won't answer that. Because it's bullshit. Empty promises. 

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

K.

&gt; Short Seller Attempts to Falsely Link Departure of Former CFO with Nikola One Deposits Announcement: Nikola’s former CFO was terminated by the Company. His departure, as well as subsequent litigation (which he voluntarily dismissed), were unrelated to the Company’s announcement that it would refund Nikola One reservation deposits. As Nikola communicated via Twitter in April 2018, “We don't use your money to operate our business. We want everyone to know we have never used a dollar of deposit money in the history of our company.” Any innuendo by the short seller report that these separate events were connected and indicative of questions regarding Nikola’s use of deposits is inaccurate.

Meaningless. The claim questions whether those deposits ever existed in the first place. Quoting yourself on Twitter doesn't make it go away, Trevvy boi.

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

K lol

&gt; Short Seller Alleges that 2016 Nikola One “was not a real truck and was, in fact, a pusher”: The Nikola One is a real truck that sits in Nikola’s showroom. A pusher means a vehicle that was not designed to be moved by its own propulsion system. The Nikola One was, in fact, **designed to be** powered and driven by its own propulsion.

&gt; Here are the facts:

&gt; Gearbox was functional and **bench tested** prior to installation.

&gt; Batteries were functional.

&gt; Inverters functioned and powered the motors on a bench test prior to the show.

&gt; Power steering, Suspension, Infotainment, Air Disc Brakes, High Voltage, and Air Systems were all functional.
As Nikola pivoted to the next generation of trucks, it ultimately decided not to invest additional resources into completing the process to make the Nikola One drive on its own propulsion. After pivoting, Nikola produced prototypes for the Nikola Two, which are self-propelled and have been frequently demonstrated, beginning with demonstration runs at Nikola World in April 2019.

&gt; The Nikola One was an incredibly successful proof of concept, and everything the Company learned from that experience has underpinned the successful development of its next generation of trucks that can be seen driven here.

So, summary: It was a pusher. Trevor implied MULTIPLE TIMES at multiple locations that the truck was fully functional and drivable. In fact at NikolaWorld he said they had chains across the interior because they didn't want people ""driving it off the stage"" lol. The truck being ""designed to be"" propelled on its own doesn't make it reality. I designed my Ford Pinto to drive 200mph but it doesn't actually do that. Doesn't mean I can call it a Ferrari. This is a complete crock of shit. 

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

Well, no...but k. 

&gt; Short Seller Distorts Nikola One 2017 Third Party “Future of Transportation” Promotion Video and Creates a Popular Lie: Hindenburg seeks to portray Nikola as misrepresenting the capabilities of the Nikola One prototype in a 2017 video produced by a third party, as “simply filmed rolling down a big hill.” **Nikola never stated its truck was driving under its own propulsion** in the video, although the truck was designed to do just that (as described in previous point). The truck was showcased and filmed by a third party for a commercial. **Nikola described this third-party video on the Company’s social media as “In Motion.” It was never described as “under its own propulsion” or “powertrain driven.”** Nikola investors who invested during this period, in which the Company was privately held, knew the technical capability of the Nikola One at the time of their investment. This three-year-old video of a Nikola prototype is irrelevant except for the fact that the short seller is trying to use it for its main thesis. The fact is, Nikola has real working hydrogen fuel-cell powered semi-trucks. Any reports intended to suggest that Nikola’s trucks do not drive are erroneous, and recent videos of Nikola vehicles driving can be found here.

This might be my favorite part. So they did roll it down a hill, but it's ok because ""we never said it was under its own propulsion"". Fucking LOL.

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

Sure, if you consider false and misleading to be completely factually correct. 

&gt; Short Seller Intentionally Underestimates Extent of Hydrogen Production Capabilities: Nikola continues to believe that its **planned** hydrogen station network, and the production and distribution of hydrogen, will provide key competitive advantages that drive sustained profitability and shareholder value over the long term. Nikola representatives occupy leadership positions in industry organizations, including as working group chairs within the worldwide International Standards Organization (Heavy Duty) hydrogen fueling standard development and the Society of Automotive Engineers fuel cell standards committee for the HD vehicles’ fuel economy. The Company has also partnered with one of the most well-known hydrogen experts in the world, Nel ASA. Further, Nikola has already installed a 1,000 kg hydrogen storage and dispensing **demo station** at its headquarters and ordered over $30 million of electrolyzers to support the initial hydrogen station rollout. Read more in the Company’s press release.

Lol, ""we installed a demo station and a tank to hold all the hydrogen we don't produce, so it's all good guys. Nothing to see here...move along.""

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

K.

&gt; Short Seller Alleges NZT Program Was Scrapped after Unveiling: The program remains underway. The first NZT enclosed cab display model is sitting in Nikola’s showroom at its headquarters. The Company has since spent millions of dollars preparing the NZT enclosed cab version for production using both internal and external resources. More to come at Nikola World 2020.

This might be the only actual good rebuttal here, but it's effectively ""nuh uh!!"" so who knows if it's actually true. It's not like we have any reason to trust what this company says so far.

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

K. 

&gt; Short Seller Quotes Spokesman of Fuel-Cell Competitor, Powercell AB, as Saying Nikola Battery and Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Technology is “Hot Air”: Third-party competitor views of Nikola and the Company’s technology are not relevant.
These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

They are relevant when it means they are confirming what everyone already suspects: that this company is built on lies and empty promises.

&gt; Short Seller Takes Shots at Nikola Employees: Nikola believes in talent, and each of the employees unfairly described in the short seller report are making important contributions to the success of the Company. Nikola has built a deep bench of experienced leaders, with significant expertise in the automotive and electric-vehicles industry. Kevin Lynk is a talented mechanical engineer who has specialized in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element analysis (FEA), computer-aided design (CAD) and product data management (PDM). Kevin has also played an instrumental role in the design and development of most Nikola vehicles since the beginning of the Company. **Travis Milton previously owned and operated his own construction company preparing him for hydrogen station infrastructure and buildouts**. Dale Prows has over 30 years of experience in supply chain and purchasing in the petrochemical and aluminum industries.

Maybe Kevin and Dale are ok. Not sure how running a construction company prepares you for building a worldwide hydrogen distribution network, but whatever...that's just me I guess.

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

Mmmkay.

&gt; Short Seller Misrepresents Value of 2010 Contract between Swift Transportation and dHybrid Systems LLC: This agreement was from 2010, and has no connection with or association to Nikola. In its report, Hindenburg criticizes Mr. Milton’s statements about the approximately $250 million value of the contract between Swift Transportation and dHybrid (not Nikola), and cites only selected clauses to misrepresent the value of the contract as being worth “only $16 million.” What Hindenburg fails to include are the provisions in the contract whereby Swift was granted an option to acquire up to an additional 11,700 systems at $20,000 per vehicle, bringing the total potential value of the contract to $250 million. The contract can be found here (see paragraph 6(b)).

This is true, I picked it out also. However a) an option is not a contract. b) Trevor said ""$250M+"" in the email which was contractually false (as evidenced by this statement right here lol) and c) Trevor also represented it as ""$300M+"" in a presentation which is completely baseless. No explanation for that. Just exaggeration and embellishment to mislead investors. 

&gt; These allegations by the short seller are false and misleading, and designed to manipulate the market to profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola’s stock price.

Incorrect. But ok. 

&gt; There are dozens more inaccurate allegations made by the short seller, which are not relevant to Nikola.

There were 53 questions, only a couple of which Nikola has answered with this response, and badly at that. 

&gt; Nikola is building novel and revolutionary technology from the ground up. As part of this process, and as part of the Company’s evolution, growth and development, Nikola has quickly and nimbly pivoted its business model based on the industry, macro environment, technology and other factors in pursuit of the most value-enhancing path forward. Nikola remains committed to enhancing shareholder value for the long term and will not waver from its mission.

...until they're investigated for fraud. 

---

That's my analysis. what do you guys think? The general sentiment I get from this is still the same as always ... a whole bunch of misdirection, vague statements that leave the company an out, and a whole lot of promises. IMHO, there is nothing concrete in the Hindenburg report that constitutes outright fraud except maybe the misdirection about the ""driving"" truck, but there is a TON of misdirection and misleading statements. There are also many, many unanswered questions still. IMO, if the SEC cares at all about regulating the market this company will go down hard eventually, but it may take a while.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,524871,public,confidence,self,"Nikola ""Sets the Record Straight"" on False and Misleading Short Seller Report (Note the quotes lol)",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ismrgy/nikola_sets_the_record_straight_on_false_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wind, solar and other renewable sources accounted for 61% of Google's global hourly electricity usage last year.

# U.S. Stock Futures Push Higher Amid 3 Merger Deals

[U.S. stock futures](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing) are rising after two weeks of [stock market](https://stockmarket.com/stock-market-trends-articles/what-is-the-stock-market-2020-06-01) sell-off. Is this a sign of bigger upward movements to come? The positive sentiments came from news of high profile acquisition over the weekend. The Dow futures traded 0.82% higher. The [S&amp;P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) and [Nasdaq 100](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=QQQ) futures were also in positive territory, moving 1.18% and 1.7% higher respectively as of 6.58 a.m. ET.

There are a few reasons for the strong start of the week. This came after Nvidia ([NVDA Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=NVDA)) reported that it will acquire wireless chip designer Arm Holdings from SoftBank for $40 billion. In addition, China’s ByteDance has reportedly agreed to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok to Oracle ([ORCL Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=ORCL)). So if you’re looking for any trading activity on Monday, the tech sector could be a good place to start.

## Coronavirus Vaccine Hopes Boosts Market Confidence

Coronavirus cases worldwide have surpassed 29 million. Covid-19 deaths are now more than 900,000. In the U.S. alone, coronavirus cases have hit 6.70 million, with deaths above 198,000. However, most importantly will be the impact on market sentiment this week as AstraZeneca ([AZN Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AZN)) restarted their final-stage trial of its coronavirus vaccine. The trial was paused last week after one fell ill. Thus far, it’s still unclear what the reason was. Perhaps it was related to the vaccine. But it is just as likely that it was totally unrelated.

Pfizer ([PFE Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=PFE)) and BioNTech ([BNTX Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=BNTX)) are looking to expand their late-stage coronavirus vaccine trial to 44,000 people, from 30,000. That would allow testing on a more diverse population. The AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidates are generally seen as furthest along, with Moderna ([MRNA Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=MRNA)) following closely behind. With a slight ‘positive’ development from the vaccine manufacturers, the market appears to be optimistic. This likely contributed partly to the rise of the U.S. stock futures on Sunday evening.

## Apple’s September 15 “Time Flies” Event; What To Expect?

Apple ([AAPL Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AAPL)) unveils its new lineup of Apple devices on September 15 at 10 a.m PT.  This may pave the way for the arrival of the iPhone 12, which will finally find the company embracing 5G technology. On top of that, almost certainly, the trillion-dollar tech company would also introduce a new Apple Watch. The device continues to be a big seller for the company, not to mention being a category-leading product. 

And strings for an “Apple One” bundle have shown up in code for an Apple Music app for Android. This is suggesting that Apple may be close to launching its rumored range of subscription bundles. While consumers are no doubt very excited to check out the latest products and services from Apple, investors are trying to get a grasp on how the stock would perform around the event date. Will Apple surprise investors with news that can send AAPL stock higher this week? Stay tuned.

## Federal Reserve Policy Meeting

The Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday should be closely watched by investors. This comes after weeks following the central bank’s annual economic policy symposium. Recall that officials announced a new framework that is more tolerant of inflation overshooting the 2% target. This reduces the need for officials to raise rates to curtail a run-up in inflation.

With many expecting the Fed to maintain its dovish stance on policy, investors will continue assessing the recovery of the global economy from the pandemic. Traders are mindful of recent news on volatility in the options markets. After all, that poses a question mark on the sustainability of the market rally in the past few months. 

## Gold Gains On Weaker Dollar

[Gold prices](https://stockmarket.com/featured/top-gold-stocks-to-watch-in-september-2020-2020-09-01) rose on Monday, supported by a weaker dollar and expectations that the Fed will adopt a dovish stance like we just mentioned. It rose nearly 0.3% to $1,946.67 per ounce as of 3.43 a.m. ET. As major central banks continue to roll out stimulus measures and keep interest rates low, gold prices will continue to find strong support because of its role as a hedge against inflation.

“The gold market is leaning towards the Fed’s policy,” said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, adding that the U.S. central bank might not change the current narrative, but there is a strong belief in the market that it would be able to trigger inflation.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,524801,public,confidence,self,Top 5 Things To Watch In The Stock Market This Week,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/isjy8n/top_5_things_to_watch_in_the_stock_market_this/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the perspective of investor structure, based on transaction value, local individual investors accounted for approximately 19.5% of the Hong Kong market, local institutional investors accounted for approximately 19.4%, exchange participants accounted for 21.9%, and foreign institutional investors accounted for approximately 19.5%.

Other investors are more inclined to hold stocks in Hong Kong and US stocks, so that they can use the 24-hour trading window to enjoy greater trading flexibility.

So I’m an avid reader of JJ Collins blog and his book The Simple Path to Wealth. 

One of the concepts of his book I don’t fully understand. 

Here is an excerpt from his blog: 


Back in March I shared with you a move I made to eliminate a future capital gains tax in the post Taking Advantage of Mr. Bear. In it I described selling VTSAX in our taxable account, taking advantage of the fact the market had dropped and it could be sold without incurring a capital gain. At the same time, I bought the same amount of VTSAX in our IRAs. Also at the same time, we bought the same amount of VBTLX (bonds) in the taxable account and sold (to buy VTSAX) in the IRAs. Net result: Exactly the same stock/bond allocation, with the capital gain wiped out.
 
This week, with stocks recovered in price, I did the same in reverse. Once again our allocation is the same, but the bonds are back in the IRAs where they are best held. VTSAX is back in the taxable account, but now at a higher cost basis.

End:


So I’m trying to understand how to do what he did. I remember reading that once a year he allocated his 75/25 slock/blond spilt. 

So can anyone help clarify his blog post for me? When I sell and the market is low and I move those funds into a bond?

So when the market is going down it’s better to have money in bonds. Because bonds have guaranteed positive interest rates. But how much should I sell on stocks and buy in bonds? 

I don’t fully understand his once a year reallocation plan. He says you only need bonds when you get older so I only have stocks. 

I only have FZROX and I don’t have any bonds. I bought that instead of VTSAX because their is no fee. Also in the above excerpt from his blog he leverages his IRA. I’m not exactly sure why he does that either. 

I have an IRA and an HSA. Any help? 

Note: I may be talking about two different tools. One tool he mentions in his blog post copied above, and the other tool is the once a year reallocation between stocks and bonds, which I’m assuming is the same tool from the book to the blog post, only the blog post seems to have a more complex maneuver because of the IRA.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,524715,public,confidence,self,Taking advantage of Mr. Bear,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/iseo64/taking_advantage_of_mr_bear/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So my whole portfolio ($16,000 invested is down 5%) $15,200.

Here is a list of some main companies/share price/holdings

AAPL - 7 shares @ $129.45 = $906.15
NVDA - 3 shares @ $537.30 = $1612.2
SQ - 6 shares @ $161.60 = $969.60
RKT - 15 shares @ $31.03 = $465.45
BIGC - 2 shares @ $132.39 = $264.78
FB - 8 shares @ $238.98 = $1911.84
GOOG-1.5 shares @ $1634.63 = $2451.95
QQQ
SNP500 tracker etc

Now my question about “timing the market”

Realistically in 10 years do you see of my shares doubling in price since i brought literally at the peak of a massive bull run

I feel like I have 2 options and i’d like some input if possible please!

Option 1 - sell portfolio at a loss of 5% ($15,200 new total, DCA into a total world index fund over the next 6 months, lets say make 7% over the 10 years - $15,200 &gt; 10 years interest @ 7% &gt; $29,900.

Option 2 - hold, stress, constantly watch my positions, panic more of a steeper loss, yeah

I feel like I got sucked into this whole “you cant time the market” through reddit.. would it be best to take the L learn from it, invest wisely into an index fund each month and not “stress” about checking my app every fucking hour.

Does anybody see them companies and there price literally almost fucking doubling from there already outrageous prices in the next 10 years or should I just take the L, learn move on and enjoy my day..

Article:

Oracle Corp. ORCL -0.58% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, a person familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.65% in a deal to salvage a social-media service that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.

Oracle is set to be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the person said.

Microsoft earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd.

“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement said. “To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.”

The move by Beijing-based ByteDance comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.

President Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn’t sold to an American company by Sept. 15, though it isn’t clear if that is the operative deadline. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn’t sold to a U.S. buyer. That gives the parties until Sept. 20 to seal a deal.

TikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app’s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.

The Trump administration has pushed for a sale, expressing concern that TikTok could pass on data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China’s authoritarian government. TikTok has said it hasn’t been asked to share data with the Chinese government and wouldn’t do so if asked.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,524670,public,confidence,self,Tiktok rejected Microsoft and chose Oracle instead,0,[],0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/isaqsu/tiktok_rejected_microsoft_and_chose_oracle_instead/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1600045578.0

Impossible, right? How could option speculation with small amounts of money affect share prices?

The answer is that call options have a leveraged hedging effect. Read Benn Eifert's real-world Amazon (AMZN) example, in tweets:

https://mobile.twitter.com/bennpeifert/status/1302725084075810817

TL;DR: a retail trader spends $1500 buying an AMZN call option and Goldman Sachs is forced to spend $230,000 buying AMZN shares (to hedge)

Everyone hates ZeroHedge. But here is a ZeroHedge article summarizing **a Goldman Sachs report** on the ""retail options frenzy"":

https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/goldman-spots-historic-inversion-market

""...a significant portion of this increase has been driven by higher volumes in short dated contracts... OTM calls traded in Tesla stock. Options volumes have been driven higher... AMZN, TSLA, AAPL, NFLX and FB had the highest volumes in July.""

Disclaimer: these are my opinions and intended only for discussion purposes. Not advice or offer to sell securities.

BioNTech and Moderna will be dominating the news cycle in October. Both companies should be able to report their interim results for early approval by mid October. Covid was the biggest news of Spring and Summer; vaccine will become the biggest news topic of fall. Odds of a vaccine that is in Phase 3 trials gaining approval is 85%. Odds of one of two gaining approval is calculated as follows (1-(1-0.85)\^2=0.9775). So essentially 98%. This doesn't factor in any exogenous factor that affects approval of both vaccine (eg. rouge FDA officer, political pressure, Media, ...). Early use authorization bring in its own complexities and risks. This should be essentially the only hurdle to approval. It's hard to estimate the risk of early approval. My wild guess is 10-20% risk due to politics. Sadly vaccine approval will become politicised.

A note about Astrazeneca: They were in the lead but they started their US arm of study too late. Suffered 1.5 setbacks with demyelination. For practical reasons I consider the odds of them applying and gaining early approval to be low and not worth considering. This is essentially a wild card.

A note about Novavax: has the best vaccine in terms of storage and ease of administration. They are in Phase 2 and will win big if frontrunners falter.

I expect markets to start moving before companies report that they have their interim results. The biggest beneficiaries of vaccine news is the vaccine companies and recovery stocks: restaurants, casinos, discretionary retail, airlines and cruise lines.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,524450,public,confidence,self,!!

So I live in a place affected by the wildfires and the air quality is hard to breath. People here are scared these fires are going to become a seasonal occurrence. People here are scared for the future their children will grow up in. 

These levels of pollution in the air are horrifying. Must worse than any pollution made by industry and cars, like it was in the 70s. We can’t even go outside here. 

Then I got a buddy in lake Charles Lousiana who’s home was destroyed by a hurricane. And two years before that, my friends in Houston got flooded out. 

So I’m just curios when people invest in companies that don’t care about the affects their products have on the environment, do you just say that these changes in the world are just natural and not man made? Is that how you sleep at night? 

Because were I see it, I think it would be wise to invest in products that are good for the environment. Things that don’t contain lead, or poison people like tobacco. 

Then of course carbon is the main source of concern. Maybe that’s why Tesla is booming because people are starting to realize the future of our world depends on our choices. 

People say we can spilt the atom, travel to the moon, and invent the computer, but that we cannot change our own climate. I don’t know why you, if you disagree with me, believe that denying climate change is caused by mans activity, how is denying climate change helping our world other than keeping certain people rich. 

Maybe you think that because your stock goes up, then you have made the right choice. But my mother is lying in a hospital bed because of a heart condition attributed to cigarette smoke. 

While she made the choice to smoke, the corporation that produced those cigarettes are responsible for poisoning her. Is it moral to invest in a company that uses addictive components in their product to exploit the undisciplined? 

Is it moral to invest money in a company that destroys the air we breath? Or damages our ecosystem. Why do people on this forum only care about profit?

It just seems like we as humans get so focused on a goal like making money we forget to look at the big picture. I have a total market index fund and I’m about ready to pull out of it and only invest in green companies that dont use toxins. 

I don’t want to lose my money, but I also want to breath clean air. I can’t keep sitting on the sidelines watching my world die. 

I’m so sad for you, if you think, I will go broke. I’m so very very sad for you. Because our society places money above all else, so we have a measurable goal of success. Yet how can we spend our money if we can’t even leave the house. 

Or if we just have to use our investment income to repair our flooded homes. 

I’m so angry at the people with power who lie and convince others that man doesn’t create climate change. I’m so angry because their motives are purely for profit. But while our stock market goes up.

They just announced that they're going to sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia. Just in case you aren't aware, the majority of all mobile phones currently in existence is using ARM processors using IP owned by Arm Holdings. Also, Apple recently abandoned Intel's x64 CPUs in favour of a new ARM-based architecture for their new line of MacBooks.

Nvidia used to be all about GPUs, then they expanded into the HPC market and now they might even expand into the mobile device market. Who knows.

Where do you think this is going? Could this be the foundation for a completely new line of products? Do you have any big moves planned for Monday?

I would like to hear your opinion and suggestions for improvement of my investment plan.

I am 25 years old and from Germany I started to invest at the beginning of the year. I already made some mistakes and I had a portfolio with a value of 8500€ which I had to sell due to family reasons. In the old portfolio I invested in 1 company every month, it was not that bad performing although I had no idea what I was doing, I made a lot of mistakes but I also had some lucky hits so I was about broke even when i sold. Since the beginning of this year i have read 3 books and i think it is now time to start a new portfolio and invest with a real plan.This time I have turned the tables and first of all I looked for sectors that I am interested in and believe in, then I looked for companies in these sectors whose products convince me and which in my opinion have a solid business model, I will invest in 2 companies from each sector that convince me the most and are available at my broker, preferably until my retirement with a monthly budget of 600€.

It is in my eyes a passive and aggressive investment plan at the same time. i plan to be selfemployed and it takes too much time for me to analyze every single company and to keep up to date with every company and putting my whole monthly budget into etfs is somehow too boring for me so i thought of this system and somehow it feels right it is definitely not the safest or the one with potentially the best performance but it seems to be right for me.Please don't get me wrong I have looked in every company on this list in some more and in some less, so far that I can say that none of them is completely junk atleast in my eyes. this took a lot of work, thoughts and time to make so im extremely excited for your feedback guys thanks to everyone for reading!

Netflix (NFLX) is often lumped in with the other high-growth tech stocks like Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). Netflix is the “N” in “FAANG,” after all. But co-founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings says Netflix has a key advantage over competitors: a singular focus.

“You know, they're doing a lot of things that are interesting, but we're focused on being a great entertainment company,” he said, referring to Amazon and Apple. “We have the advantage of a single focus, this is all what we are about. And we work really hard to continue to be the best in the world at it.”

And Netflix has exploited that focus to dramatic affect.

Nikola founder Trevor Miilton is understandably agitated over the incident and is currently working on a rebuttal of the report. He actually posted multiple photos of the inside of the hydrogen vehicle they are working on, taunting Hindenburg: ""Do these look fake?""

How do you think this is going to play out? Will Nikola survive as a company? Will the bad press scare away any of the big partners such as GM and Bosch?

# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.
*****
&gt; But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.
*****
&gt; “The market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,″ she said. The Fed’s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market’s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it’s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market’s sell-off.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. “I don’t think they’ll do anything to the markets either way,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&amp;P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.
*****
&gt; Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed’s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.
*****
&gt; “We see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,” the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. “The market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,” she said.
*****
&gt; BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.
*****
&gt; Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.
*****
&gt; “Depending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,” said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.
*****
&gt; “Our view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,” said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.
*****
&gt; “There is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it’s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.
*****
&gt; Chandler also noted the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.
*****
&gt; “My sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it’s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They’ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,” he said.
*****
&gt; Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we’re going to make new highs,” he said.

&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1

&gt; First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001—19 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.

&gt; One of the top requests we’ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.

&gt; Here’s how the S&amp;P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.

&gt; Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven’t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.

&gt; Here’s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn’t a lame duck president.

&gt; # Active Managers Do an About Face

&gt; The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.

&gt; This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&amp;P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?

&gt; # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000

&gt; Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.

&gt; At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.

&gt; With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.

&gt; There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).

&gt; One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.

&gt; These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&amp;P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**

&gt; Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.

&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).

&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).

&gt; While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!

&gt; # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates

&gt; While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL’s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.

&gt; “Even in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Among them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:

&gt; * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise—likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.
&gt; * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that’s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don’t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.
&gt; * **Don’t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.
&gt; * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.
&gt; * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.
With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.

&gt; # Best and Worst Performing Stocks Since the 9/2 High

&gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq peaked on September 2nd, we've seen rotation out of the post-COVID winners and rotation into laggards in the value space. Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&amp;P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.

&gt; Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.

&gt; Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.

&gt; What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**

&gt; While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.

&gt; # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End

&gt; As of yesterday’s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&amp;P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today’s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

Stocks again traded choppily today as market volatility continued. Tech shares continued to slide after last month’s historic rally. The S&amp;P and Dow finished slightly green, while the Nasdaq underperformed to finish firmly in the red. 

The Dow led the session, finishing 0.47% up, the S&amp;P was 0.06% up and the Nasdaq underperformed, ending the day 0.69%. Precious metals were modestly up (Gold 0.11%, Silver 0.24%), but gold miners were firmly down (GDX 1.03% down)

The Nasdaq sank 1.4%, as the index was pressured by an ongoing rout in some of their most heavily weighed big tech shares. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped 1.35% and tracked toward a weekly loss of more than 8%. Amazon (AMZN) was down 1.85%, Microsoft (MSFT) was 0.56% down, Facebook was 0.55% down, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was 0.73% down.  

The New York Stock Exchange is signaling that it will move its electronic trading systems out of New Jersey if the state implements a proposed tax on financial transactions. The NYSE said it will run one of its exchanges from a backup site in Chicago for a week as a demonstration of its readiness to quit the state, according to a notice sent to clients, per the Wall Street Journal

The federal budget deficit surpassed $3 trillion through August, according to official Treasury data released Friday, and is expected to hit $3.3 trillion when the fiscal year wraps up at the end of this month. The figures, which confirm earlier estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), show that the deficit is on track to be the largest in the country’s financial history. The $3.3 trillion figure is well over double the largest previous record of $1.4 trillion in 2009, during the financial crisis. Meanwhile in congress hopes for a new stimulus are looking bleak for now.

**Summary**

Since its founding in 2012, Snowflake has grown into a leader in the cloud data warehousing space. The company's intuitive solution makes it easy to run analytical queries with a customer-aligned billing model. Intriguingly, Snowflake has established itself without the founder-led culture that dominates most of the tech industry. Instead, three external CEOs have guided the company to a \~$500M annual revenue run rate, with 132% year-over-year growth. That's attracted pre-IPO investment from Warren Buffett — a rare foray into tech for the Oracle of Omaha. Big winners of the listing include the secretive Sutter Hill Ventures and Altimeter Partners.

Snowflake's toughest task may be in weathering the coming storm. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all have products in the space, and with limited enduring defensibility, the company could see its position pressured.

I am in a job that uses charts frequently, so naturally I gravitated toward analysis with charts as a start of my learning.  I am looking at TSLA, who isn't, and trying to determine where the best buy is.  

Using graphs I am thinking right now/next week, before battery day should be a good time.  So my target would be around 350-360 for a good buy, and 360-380 for a buy.  Trying to sell at 450-550.

[My thought comes from the graphs, using Bollinger bands, RSI, and MACD.](https://imgur.com/QYLaoE0)

Looking here I can see that the stock is trading below the moving average, and starting to narrow the Bollinger bands.  In the past 6 months, which I think is fair because it is all under the cloud of COVID, this has occurred prior to gains.

This chart highlights [March 19](https://imgur.com/QuAgARG), when TSLA was bottoming out and touching the bottom of the bands.  But at this point, the MACD differential was not as wide as it is [today](https://imgur.com/t85bqzX).  So I am thinking that the next obvious inflection point is 9/22.  I am looking for in the next week the bands narrow out, and the stock should stay level.  If this occurs the price should be bottoming out on the bands suggesting that positive news should push it back up, where I am hoping it can hit the 450 target above.

While we were correct about the direction, the move was outside the expected move so Implied Volatility did not ""crush"" as the saying goes. 

Since we had a bullish put spread, the put options dropped like a rock giving us a lower premium in the option spread. This is good for net credit spreads such as ours and we took a 61% credit or a 54% profit!

As we have seen thousands of times now, playing single leg, long calls/puts for earnings is a recipe for disaster which is why I only trade spreads through earnings... if I touch earnings at all!

Applications for regular state unemployment benefits continue to number more than 800,000 each week and chances in Congress diminished for additional support for the jobless and businesses on Thursday. What’s more, funding for the temporary supplemental jobless benefit payments authorized by President Donald Trump in early August is running out.

The recovery right now is “fragile, and barring additional stimulus, the recovery will be more susceptible to downside risks,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “There’s no doubt that the full expiry of the unemployment benefits will weigh on household income and in turn deter consumer spending.”",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,522763,public,confidence,self,Economic Rebound Becomes More Fragile With U.S. Aid on Brink,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/iqqp8l/economic_rebound_becomes_more_fragile_with_us_aid/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yesterday marked another day of selling, inside a range though. Resistance held but so did support.

Things do look more bearish than bullish right now. Markets hate uncertainty and we have a lot of uncertainty in the months ahead.

Most notably the Presidential election in November and the COVID-19 pandemic are top unknowns at the moment. Taxes and shutdowns are looming issues on the ballot.

I expect volatility up until election night and possible after if results are delayed. Things will then likely stabilize by the end of the year. Opportunities should be plentiful, but the risk is high.

**Watchlist:**

**TCON** is a low float, resistance in the $4.20s

**KLR** is a low float, resistance at $9

**DLTH** is a low float, watching for a setup above $13

**LUB** is a low float, key level $2.50

**RDHL** is a lowish float, resistance at $11

**AQST** is a lowish float, resistance at $9

**GMHI** has support at $12.30

**CKPT** has resistance at $3

Noobie trader here.. Made a mistake and looking for an explanation for this.

I placed an order to buy 2TSL( 2x Tesla) before going to bed, assuming that I will own the stock around 8:00 UK time( one hour before the US pre market opens ) 

I know all about the volatile risk to owning these stocks ( I think anyway ) So my plan was to catch the tech hype pre market and sell before the US market opens. Since there is also an hour gap before it actually tracks the actual stock price, it will instead track the s&amp;p movement ( I think )

Can't post a picture here BUT WHAT THE HECK IS THE RESON FOR IT TO GO UP 4% IN THE FIRST 2 MINUTE THEN SUDDENLY DROP 8% THIS MORNING BEFORE EVEN THE US PRE MARKET OPEN????

IS THERR SOME KIND OF RE BALANCING THAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES?????? I LOST NEARLY 9%!!!!

Jordan from The Limiting Factor discusses some of his ideas as to how TSLA plans to scale the production of higher energy density batteries, with longer range/ life. Furthermore, he describes what options he believes TSLA has to scale the production of these batteries into the terrawhat hr per year. Lastly, I've seen many TSLA bulls fail to adequately describe the potential impact of BID beyond ""their gonna show off their great battery technology"" when TSLA bears ask what advantages they actually have. Hopefully this video from Jordan can show investors what TSLA is up too, along with the evidence to support his claims.

Reason I ask - earlier this year an investment occurred into LRDG ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LRDG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LRDG))   (and yeah, I know, the press releases seem more smoke-n-mirror than reality, which is why I'm trying to sell shares and get out)

The stock halted August 21st and reportedly resumed Sept 4th.   

Looking at [https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/LRDG/overview](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/LRDG/overview), there's reference to ""Expert Market"".

How does one go about trading shares on the ""Expert Market"" exchange?

The brokerage that I use lists the shares as ""Value"" exchange, which is effectively delisted and brokerage won't do anything about it.   Yahoo and others list as other OTC.

My hope is to transfer the shares over to a brokerage that will handle on the ""Expert exchange"" and exit out.

I reached out to LRDG investor relations and they responded to a few emails... right up until I asked the tough questions.

Stocks traded choppily through the session before turning sharply red near close, with big tech stocks losing steam after a brief rally yesterday. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB), and more down more than 2.5%. As of close, the Nasdaq is down 10% from its highs this week, sending it firmly into correction territory.

The Nasdaq finished 2% down, the S&amp;P 1.7% down, and the Dow 1.4% down. Precious metals, including miners, were also down (GDX 1.96% down, Gold 0.32%, and Silver 1.11% down).

The recent volatility and uneasiness in the market came directly after its best month in decades, with analysts arguing that big tech stocks were overstretched and were due for a pullback. Alastair Pinder, global equity strategist for HSBC said, “Signs of uneasiness and stretched positioning in the options market have been visible in recent weeks, with the put/call ratio collapsing, an extremely steep front-end VIX term structure, and unprecedented volumes of options traded in tech companies, particularly calls,”. Option volume in FAANGM stocks is up almost 3x when compared to the beginning of the year ($200B in volume/day in August compared to $70B in January).

Back in May, the House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion bill, which the Republicans rejected and counterproposed with a $1 trillion bill. The Democrats offered to compromise and reduce to $2.2 trillion, but that offer was also rejected. Congress then went into recess until this week. Today, Senate Democrats rejected the Republican’s latest stimulus bill, valued at $500B, with a 52-47 vote, saying the legislation didn’t even come close to providing the level of support needed during this unprecedented pandemic. Every Republican senator except Rand Paul (KY) voted for the bill, while the Democrats unilaterally opposed. The bill included liability protections, enhanced unemployment benefits of $300/week, an extension to the Paycheck Protection Program that provides small business loans, and money for additional testing, school and state reopenings, and vaccine distribution plans.

In other news, ECB head Christine Lagarde has stated that it is likely they will use the full extent of the €1.35 Trillion euros in planned stimulus support.

It's a little dated, but still a lot of interesting due diligence nonetheless, although it looks to have been written before the closing of that Lordstown Motors SPAC deal.

In essence, the author outlines all the strange anomalies surrounding this company, such as:

1. The resignation of their Chief Financial Officer only 4 days after they announced the ""purchase"" of the Lordstown Complex last year in Novemeber.
2. The fact that a plant has admittedly never been sold fully intact. with all the equipment in included
3. The extreme amount of dilution potential that one should expect would be necessary for a company to continue its operations when considering their virtually non-existent sales revenue
4. Their balance sheet (it's horrible)

Stocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a dour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused. 

The S&amp;P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.

Today, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose. 

US oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. ""Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,"" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Asia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.

Here is a hedge fund manager explaining why SoftBank likely didn't cause the recent tech stocks melt up, even though everyone is blaming SoftBank. Probably because the story is juicier that way.

""The news reports that SoftBank Group's options bets on technology stocks could have been a driving force behind the rally, but does this theory hold water?""

New investor here. Sorry if this has been asked before. If it has, feel free to point me in that direction. 

What I'm wondering is how you personally analyze whether a stock is worth investing in? (Aside from obvious speculations.) Do you review the company's financial statements? Is looking at the Price to Earnings ratio what is most important? How do you determine that the company has growth potential? What should I be looking for in the past performance of the stock? How do you decide what kind of market segments to invest in? By reading the global news and researching ideas that seem profitable?  

I'm not currently looking at investing in individual stocks because I'm so new at this, I just have investments in ETF's. I would like to learn how to analyze stocks though, as I would like to invest a small amount for ""fun"" in the future. I'm trying to avoid taking blind advice from others about where to put my money, and coming to those conclusions on my own through an actual analysis.

Luckily for us, there’s trade plans and discipline. In this short article, I am going to walk you through my process in trading options and option spreads.

My first step is to find the underlying stock I want to trade. This is a very simple process as I use scanners on Thinkorswim, by TDAmeritrade (not a sponsor). I have a few basic criteria in my three scanners to filter high, medium, and low volatility then I sort them by strike price widths so I determine the minimum risk and liquidity of the stock’s option chain.

Once I have chosen the stock I want to trade on, I identify the option strategy that is best suited for the environment. I use three basic trades. Long call options, bullish put spreads, and bearish call spreads. I very rarely use single leg put options as the majority of the time, the markets are rising on monthly time-frames. Even in the last market crash in March 2020, the recovery began within 60 days… That being said, history never repeats, but it often rhymes.

After selecting the strategy I select my strike prices. I want a spread that has a minimum Probability of Profit (PoP) that is greater than 60%. This ensures that if I make the same trade 1000 times, I will win at least around 600 of them. This doesn’t guarantee that the profit will be greater than the losses though. That’s where you need your edge.

My edge is very simple. Follow the trend. Define the risk and reward. Follow the trade plan no matter how emotional the trade may become.

For any usable trade plan, there are a few things that need to be defined. First, what is the stop loss? If we don’t define a point to cut the trade if it does not work out, the emotions will take over and as another incredible trading anomaly, we will always cut it at the worst possible time… at least it feels like it always happens that way.

After the stop loss is defined, the trade needs an exit point on the upside. Investors can hold forever, but that’s not how traders trade. This is called a profit target. Define where to get out and follow the trade plan.

With these two items defined, there is nothing the market can throw at us that we can’t handle, provided that we stick to the trade plan. In the incredible, yet simple words of Mark Douglas:

They contain a lot of information but I'm still unclear on several things.

1. Does ""posting cash or securities"" for the initial margin actually ""remove"" anything from your account or is it merely a one-time check for a sufficient amount of collateral? Is there no initial direct cost to the loan itself?
2. Do all brokers permit you to use equity securities such as long positions on common stock as collateral for both initial margin and maintenance margin? Are there any liqudity coverage ratios for these, such as at least 50% of the collateral being cash rather than more difficult to convert securities or anything along those lines?

Using equity securities for collateral threw me off because it sounds like it would enable the following scenario. Let's assume your broker has an initial margin of 50% and a maintenance of 30%. Starting out with $100,000 in cash you could then purchase $100,000 worth of common stock and perform a short sale worth $50,000 using 50% of your equity securities. After the loan of the shares, your long position could even deteriorate a bit in value as long as you stay above the required 30% maintenance margin.

Is this really possible without having any further cash in your account?

But according to Capital Economics’ senior markets economist Oliver Jones, the rapid growth in tech stocks is different from the dot-com bubble for two reasons — most big-name tech stocks are fundamentally sound companies, and, despite recent volatility, tech stocks have provided a safe haven as other industries have faltered amid the pandemic.

The tech firms aren’t just making money — they’re doing so on a sustained basis and cruising past their prior year earnings even amid a global pandemic crippling other parts of the economy.

It took 13 years to reach peak DOTCOM bubble highs, I literally invested at the highs last week.

Wouldt is be wise to sell off at a loss , buy more when it drops lower and then id have more shares for when it reaches new highs (whenever it does)

Can somebody explain why this is such a “bad” idea. 

If you buy 1 share @ $200 and u sell at $180 and it drops to $100 and u buy 1.8shares for $180.. and then in 10years it reaches new highes of $210 you now have 1.8shares instead of the 1?

Especially with how high this bubble has gone surely the term “time in the market beats timing in the market”?

The markets continued falling today, with major benchmarks falling for the third straight day as the tech sell-off continued. 

The Nasdaq performed the worst, finishing the day 4.96% down. The S&amp;P finished 2.77% and the Dow Jones finished 2.11% down

Despite the recent pullback, investors remain hopeful. analysts at Goldman Sachs said they “expect the current bull market to continue as the improved growth outlook coupled with supportive monetary policies should maintain the search for yield elevated and foster a compression of the equity risk premiums. 

This morning, companies at the forefront of the development of a COVIC-19 vaccine wrote an open letter promising to not cut corners and use all due diligence in the development of the vaccine, despite the expedited timeline and the grave necessity.

It was signed by the CEOs of companies including AstraZeneca ($AZN), Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ), and Moderna ($MRNA).

I am a new investor that knows some of the basics.  I can get around my investment app and I know at least a decent handful of terms.  Like everyone else, I would love to go ahead and start investing to get on the gain train, but the absolute mess of the market right now has kept me out for a few weeks.

I am looking at investing $1000 to start, more than likely in ETFs.  There are a lot of specific ETFs that have caught my eye, but I am not sure what to choose, especially right now.  Last thing I want to do is invest because I want to get in, and I buy right before a big correction.

All that said:

* When is a good time to buy in ($1000) with all of the mess that's going on right now?
* What do I need to consider buying?  Currently looking at large ETFs like $VOO, $SPY, $QQQ, etc. and small ETFs like $ARKK, $PHO, $ICLN, etc.
* Anything else you would find helpful

Thanks a lot in advance!",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,520049,public,confidence,self,[New Investor] - Excited to start investing.

&gt; In China, an even scarier bubble than Big Tech is brewing. It's engineered not by the nation’s notorious mom-and-pop investors, but professional stock pickers.
&gt; 
&gt; These days, even a soy sauce maker can be valued at 100 times earnings. And this is no penny stock: Foshan Haitian Flavouring &amp; Food Co. is a blue chip with an $81 billion market cap. From pig farmers to manufacturers of China’s famous fiery liquor, the food and beverage industry has surpassed banks as the heavyweight in the benchmark CSI 300 Index. On average, the sector has rallied 60% this year.  
&gt; 
&gt; This trade started to unwind last week. On Thursday, without warning, Foshan Haitian tumbled off its record high. The selloff widened to the entire sector Friday. Foshan dropped 14% in two days. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike the retail-focused tech names in Shenzhen, these blue chips are chased by institutional investors. Mutual fund managers have allocated 11.8% of their money to food and beverage stocks on average, second only to healthcare, data compiled by Haitong Securities Co. show. 

&gt;This comes just as mutual funds are raising money at record pace — at over 2 trillion yuan ($292 billion) from January to August, that’s more than all of 2019. No surprise, hybrid and stock funds got the lion’s share. This year’s bull market boosted managers’ performance, which in turn attracted inflows. 

&gt; All that money has to go somewhere. Much as Beijing has advocated investing in young hard-tech stocks, professionals are still apprehensive. More than half of their money is allocated to companies on the main boards, which have profitability requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; Food and beverage companies have become investor darlings thanks to their predictable cash flows. Take Foshan Haitian, for example. Its sales growth has been consistently above 10% since 2012, while its profit has been expanding even faster. Buying Foshan is akin to holding corporate bonds with a 10% to 20% coupon rate, wrote Bank of China Ltd. in a recent report. 
&gt; 
&gt; That may well be, but an influx of money for a limited number of shares is making this space crowded. Foshan, for instance, has a free float of just 14%, as its controlling shareholder holds a 58% stake. With floats of 26% and 33%, baijiu makers Kweichow Moutai Co. and Wuliangye Yibin Co. aren’t much better. As a result, a price-to-earnings ratio of 50 times has become the norm in this sector. 
&gt; 
&gt; To their credit, professionals still care about profit forecasts. But at what price? Food companies’ earnings yields are now well below what China’s 10-year government bonds offer, which rose above 3% last week. 
&gt; 
&gt; Money managers are having a tough time navigating the bull market this year. [A lack of market depth](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2020-08-31/you-think-faang-is-distorting-the-s-p-try-alibaba-tencent-meituan) aside, they have to find ways to not only beat the benchmark but also their peers. In China, actively managed stock funds reported an average 45% return in the first eight months. This entire industry has thus been put on a spinning wheel, perpetually looking for growth and paying an exorbitant price for it. All it takes is a further jump in bond yields, and the market’s shooting stars will come crashing down to earth.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,519943,public,confidence,self,"Sep 6 2020, Bloomberg.

Prepare yourselves for geekery. All data is sourced from SEC 13-F filings, and note that these figures are estimates and may differ significantly due to the recent large moves in tech stocks. For the most part the calculations should be accurate but because institutional ownership is relative to market cap, it can be skewed if there's a big change in stock price compared to the point the holdings data was reported. I've tried to ensure the market cap comparison is current, but it can still be a bit fucky due to the fact that the holdings data is from Q2 and Q3 hasn't been fully reported yet. It's also possible I'm just dumb and my calculations are wrong, so take this w/ a grain of salt and please point out any errors you see! K. Onward, noble gentry.*

So for something I was working on for my personal website I wanted to create some new little code snippets that would aggregate and display various stats on price performance and institutional holdings. Watching institutional holdings has led to some interesting discoveries in the past, not the least of which is the recent one that [SoftBank basically went balls out and goosed the nasdaq like a WSB YOLO'er](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-nasdaq-whale-may-have-triggered-the-stock-markets-brutal-rout-claims-report-11599234572).

Since I just finished these little snippets to aggregate this data, I decided to put them to use and check out how institutions as a whole have behaved over the last several years. I don't know if this really provides any interesting findings, but I'll share my thoughts along the way I guess and you can all argue and tell me I'm wrong/stupid/whatever ... it's the internet - have at it. Here's what I found: 

#AAPL:

Apple's institutional holdings have been pretty static over the last five years, increasing only about 2.47% over that time period. Whales seem to pretty much stick around 58-62% ownership in AAPL. That didn't stop that ownership from increasing over half a trillion bucks in value though, increasing from a value of $425 billion in 2015 to $931 billion in 2020. Over that time, Apple's share price has appreciated 330% from $28 to $120 (split adjusted). Summary: https://i.imgur.com/JhkdjnV.png (Note that shares for institutional ownership are pre-split, so multiply the share numbers by 4 to get current holdings. The percentages don't change) What I find interesting about AAPL is that as a whole, institutions actually decreased their holdings over the last three months (by 137M shares/548M post split) and still ""made"" $276B thanks to the massive tech rally (note I say ""made"" because this isn't profit, per say, it's an increase in the value of their holdings, which obviously (hopefully? lol) they're not going to dump, but it's still interesting to me!) Ok anyway - onto the next:

#AMZN:

Amazon has seen institutions decrease their holdings about 10% over the last five years. Compared to Apple's increase of 2.47% this is a pretty drastic difference, but still the whales hold 287.43 million shares of AMZN worth almost $800 billion, or about 57.47% of the company. Over that time, the value of their holdings has appreciated over $654B despite their decreasing stake, thanks to AMZN's colossal 536.59% return over that time period. AMZN's institutional holdings also decreased over the last three months, like AAPL's, but still increased in value over $230 billion or about 41.45% over that time, compared to the price appreciation in AMZN of only 30.53%. Does that mean they ""beat"" the market? Maybe I'm misinterpreting that data but that's what it seems to suggest to me. Maybe I'm retarded, please share your thoughts there. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/v9Hpccy.png

#MSFT:

Microsoft is similar to AAPL in that their institutional holdings seem to hover around the same level. It's about 70% owned by institutions and has hovered between 70-75% over the last five years. MSFT has appreciated 388% during that time, while the value of whale holdings has increased from $255B to over $1T (323%). I dunno about you guys, but my portfolio hasn't increased $824 billion in the last five years. Pretty wild. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/dp4YyjW.png

#FB:

Facebook is the first one we're looking at with a significant INCREASE in institutional holdings over the last five years, as whales have increased their stake about 10.42% from 54.85% to the current 65.27%. Over that same time period, Facebook stock has appreciated 215%, taking the value of their holdings from $132B to $422B, an increase of about 219% which is pretty much in line w/ the market. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/UPFiXY4.png

#NFLX:

Whales have been unloading Netflix over the last five years, down about 6% over that time period, but NFLX has by far the highest institutional ownership level of any we've looked at so far, at over 80% of the company valued at $161 billion. Over the last five years the value of these holdings has increased from $34 billion to $161 billion, an increase of 373% vs the stock's appreciation of 443.5%. Summary: https://i.imgur.com/CFX0Bmw.png

#GOOGL:

Google is another pretty boring one IMO. It's about 66% owned by whales, a level which has stayed pretty static over the last five years. It's only dropped about 2.5% over that time. Institutions seem to be pretty chill holding onto GOOGL and just maintaining their investment. Over that time the value of these holdings has gone from $251B to $637B as the stock increased 145% from $643 to its current price. Here's the summary: https://i.imgur.com/gd9t0nS.png

And last but not least ... 

#TSLA:

I found this one the most interesting (I mean really what did we expect lol). Over the last five years institutions have decreased their stake by 13.75%, and 8.56% of that was in the last 12 months. Total institutional ownership right now hovers around 48%, which is worth about $97 billion (96 million pre-split shares, so about 500 million now). What I find most interesting about TSLA is that even though institutional ownership has decreased about 2% in the last three months, as a whole, institutions added about 2.53 million TSLA shares which means the reason that their percentage has decreased is related to the change in TSLA's market cap. I'm not an expert but I suspect this has something to do with the retard-strength rally of 120% over the last 3 months, or maybe the fact that TSLA has gone from a split-adjusted $49 to $418, a whopping 742% increase over the last five years. Here's the summary for that: https://i.imgur.com/Isjf9Gl.png

Alright that's enough for now. I'll do more of these if people like them. Like I said I don't know if this really yields any interesting info but my takeaways from it are pretty straightforward:

1) Whales are unloading TSLA, AMZN, and NFLX on average over the last 5 years, but they own a ton of NFLX relative to the others I looked at

2) Whales are loading the boat on FB. Long FB calls or somethin, I dunno

**Summary**

Today the markets are closed in observance of labour day.

Since the close of the markets on Friday, there was a discussion that brewed up on Wall Street about a whale that had made a huge options play in the realm of $4 Billion across the last months in popular big tech stocks according to the Financial Times. However, all this news didn’t seem to impress investors as Softbank stock has slid 7% since the news broke.

This news about Softbanks options purchases has sparked further reports about a stock market rally in big tech stocks that has been caused by a surge in options buying from retail traders according to Benn Eifert, chief investment officer of hedge fund QVR Advisors as written in a Bloomberg article. The same articles goes on to cite that retail traders, in comparison to Soft Bank’s $4 Billion purchases, retail traders have poured an incredible $40 Billion in Option trades across the same period of Late June to end of August on the same type of stocks. The hypothesis is that with such a large percentage of these calls expiring in weeks, the writers had to buy the stock in order to cover themselves which caused the rally.

Another big news that broke over the weekend was that Tesla Inc. ($TSLA) was not included in the S&amp;P500. Three companies were added: Etsy ($ETSY), Catalent ($CTLT) and Teradyne ($TER) to the S&amp;P500 index. The ones that were taken out are: H&amp;R Block ($HRB), Coty ($COTY) and Kohl’s ($KSS).

On other news, there are alarming reports coming out of India that Coronavirus cases are rising out of control reaching 4.2 Million, with many expecting it to overtake the U.S. as the global epicenter which is currently sitting at 6.3 Million cases.

Lastly, China export numbers for the month of August beat expectations rising 9.5% from a year ago, which is the largest increase in 18 months according to Reuters.

Stimulus talks continue to develop at a slow pace, and the election is moving forward as planned.

Since Amazon's early days, reviews are the one big metric customers have relied on to determine the quality and authenticity of a product. Amazon's listings often have hundreds or thousands of reviews, instead of the handful found on competing marketplaces. But many of those reviews can't be trusted. Thousands of fake reviews have flooded Amazon, Walmart, eBay and others, as sales have skyrocketed.

The repercussions are getting more serious, too, as shoppers stay home and increasingly turn online for things they'd normally want to shop for in person. In recent months, fake reviews have boosted sales of unsafe products and hurt business for legitimate sellers, causing huge brands to sever ties with Amazon.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,519194,public,confidence,self,Amazon is filled with fake reviews and it's getting harder to spot them,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/io6nll/amazon_is_filled_with_fake_reviews_and_its/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, not that it necessarily matters, but I’m a 28 year old guy with no formal education, no experience whatsoever in the stock market, and no extraordinary abilities or accomplishments under my belt besides the fact that I’ve been told I can read 3x faster than the average person. Which isn’t that extraordinary considering it doesn’t mean I can necessarily absorb information 3x faster. Anyway, I live in my car with my wife at the moment, we’re moving into somewhere soon hopefully. I’m not on here looking for a handout or pity or anything of that nature. What I’m seeking is someone who might be able to teach me the basics of what I need to know about swing trading and making money in the stock market. I’ve seen tons of ads where guys promise me they will get me rich and to buy their training programs or dvds, and that’s just not for me. First of all, I can’t afford it, second of all more than 3/4 of that crap is them telling you their success story and very general information and saying what they will show you without actually teaching you anything. Once I have my mind set on something I’m very diligent about it. The past two weeks I’ve done nothing but read and watch videos and look at charts of or pertaining to stocks and the market. I KNOW I’m smart and patient enough to make money doing this, and I know it will take time and that there is probably a huge learning curve. If there is anyone out there at all that likes to teach or would be willing to take someone on, I promise I will listen and follow direction of course as long as you can show me or explain to me enough how you’ve been successful at this stuff as well. Unfortunately, I have nothing to offer. No money, no personal property or any valuables...only my sincere and rapt attention and overwhelming gratitude to anyone that might be able to teach me....well, anything I don’t know really.

So I did a lot of DD in the past weeks and come up with some stock that can potentially have the biggest earnings of the year. 

As you can see on this link, the lumber price. It reached a peak in 2018 at $600.. Today it's at $875.  That means that lumber company are making a lot of money on this margin! 

[https://ca.investing.com/commodities/lumber](https://ca.investing.com/commodities/lumber)

&amp;#x200B;

So as an investor I saw this opportunity to make enough money to add a fry and a coke with my meal. I seek lumber stock that could be explosive! Many of them have already recovered from the Covid19 crash but i was wondering how far can they go? 

  
I looked at CFP, IFP and WFT wondering what was their price in 2018 when the lumber was ''all time high''.. Turns out it was $33,62 for CFP vs $16,57 now. $27 for IFP  vs $16.42 now and $96 for WFT vs $67 now.

All of them had an amazing Q2 where they all bump a crazy 25% soar. So now what is left? well the party isn't over...for many analysts it is not over till the lumber price is back near the $400 what do they think the price is? Well let's take CFP ...

Scotiabank - 23$

BMO-29$ 

CIBC-25$

Royal Bank-26$

Raymond James-24$

Overall this is going up according to many finest analyst.   
What is my bet on it? You already know.... THE MOON!

Imagine SoftBank buys a TSLA call option from Goldman Sachs for $1

That TSLA call option gives SoftBank the right to buy a TSLA share from Goldman for $500

Goldman Sachs wants to make sure he can easily sell a TSLA share to SoftBank for $500 even if the TSLA share price jumps up to $650 overnight

So Goldman Sachs buys a share of TSLA at the current market price (say, $475) to ""hedge"" the call option that he sold to SoftBank

Now that Goldman owns a $475 TSLA share, he can sell it to SoftBank for $500, no problem

In this way, SoftBank spends $1 to buy a call option and in doing so forces Goldman Sachs to buy a TSLA share for $475

In reality, SoftBank spent more than $4 billion buying call options, and in doing so forced market makers to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of worth of shares

The crazy 2019/2020 moves in TSLA have little or no meaning, valuation-wise

##**TLDR**

We're going to try a weekly thread where we allow self-promotion in an effort to find quality external content we're missing out on in this sub, and reward its creators. You can share/promote your own content in this thread, but read ""**THE IMPORTANT PART**"" and the rules before you do or you might get hit with the banhammer. If you have suggestions to improve the effectiveness of this idea, share them too!

##**BACKGROUND**

As the sub has grown recently (218k members in the last 8 months!) we've taken a pretty strict stance against self promotion in an effort to prevent spammers and scammers ruining the sub. It's been effective, and we've banned and/or removed posts from hundreds of people trying to shill various shady services or just really not contributing anything to the sub other than trying to spam us w/ their own blogs/tools/apps/YouTube videos/Instagram pages or whatever else they can dream up. In general, my personal stance on this has been to look at the user's post history and if it's obvious that they're just using Reddit for a marketing tool, I issue either a temp or permanent ban depending on how obnoxious the person is being and whether I think they will even care or notice if they got banned. Otherwise, if they're generally not to spammy, it's the first time I've seen it come up and they haven't reposted it across ten different subs, or they contribute to the sub in other ways, I'll just end up removing the post and possibly issuing a short temp ban to let them know that they're breaking the rules. In some of these cases if the content they've shared is actually high quality and was just removed due to trying to apply the rules fairly to everyone, I've even added their tools/content/resources to the [market toolkit](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit) linked in the sidebar so that their work gets some exposure and recognition.

Anyway, the downside to these blanket-type rules is that a lot of people who *do* contribute to the sub and who *are* producing quality content elsewhere, whether it's on their YouTube channels, apps/websites they're building, blogs they write for, or even things like sharing their own articles on reputable websites are being discouraged from sharing their content - or even worse, being banned - for trying to contribute content that would really benefit a lot of people here. It also means that in general, the content of the sub is lower quality and filled with hundreds of the same ""how do I get started?"" and ""should I buy TSLA?"" posts, which sucks. It also sucks because we're not giving anything back to our best contributing members who are here constantly responding to comments and helping people out. For these people who are genuinely trying to help people, when they occasionally pop up and share something from their YouTube/blog/wherever, we shouldn't be robbing them of their content by forcing them to copy/paste it here in text form and remove all the links and all references to the fact that they were the one who put in the effort to create it for us. We should allow them to share it as a way to say thanks for contributing to the sub and to give them some reward for their effort.

Of course this is a desperate balancing act between trying to reward people who contribute quality content and discourage spammers, but I think that having a slightly different approach to this could vastly improve the content of this sub.

##**THE IMPORTANT PART**

So, as an experiment, today and for the next few weeks we're going to try something new called **Spammy Sunday!** On Spammy Sunday (or maybe Spammy Saturday? Preference, anyone?) we'll make a post like this one and **in this thread you will be allowed to share/promote your own tools, websites, YouTube videos, or other content you feel is valuable to the community**. 

These rules may change later, but let's see how this goes for now. The standard rules for self promotion still apply outside this thread, and I'll edit the sidebar verbiage once we determine if this is going to be a success or not. Til those rules are updated pending the results of our little experiment here, **any form of self promotion outside this thread will still result in a ban.** Here's my initial set of rules, but feel free to suggest others if you think of something I'm missing:

##**THE RULES**

As a **contributor** to the thread (i.e. someone sharing your own content):

- You **must** do it in a top level comment. If you hijack someone else's comment to promote your own content, your post will be removed and you will be permanently banned w/o question cause that's just a dick move.

- Please have some post history in this sub before promoting your own content here. If you create an account solely to promote yourself and don't contribute anything else, you'll probably be banned cause you're not giving us anything in return. We may create an automod rule to spam/ban people who do this if it becomes an issue

- If your content requires any kind of subscription/signup/payment, **you must disclose this and share some sort of sample**. Free/freemium is best, but paid services/content is ok IF you explain its value and share some examples so people can make an educated decision. 

As a **viewer** of this thread: 

- Upvote stuff that is genuinely good content and people who are genuinely contributing something valuable
- Downvote stuff that is low-effort or low quality
- Downvote and report all referral links/shills
- Downvote and report anyone hijacking others comments to promote themselves
- Downvote and report **anyone** suspected of using alt accounts to manipulate votes/comments
- Downvote anyone whose post history is basically just them spamming the same thing everywhere

**Content you CAN share**: 

- Your own market-related YouTube videos/commentary, due diligence, technical/fundamental analysis, educational stuff, etc
- Watchlists and actionable trading ideas. If they're hosted on your own site and/or behind a paywall, people **must** be able to get something of value out of it for free in this thread.
- Blogs/articles you've written yourself
- Apps/websites/tools you have created or are creating yourself
- Updates/new additions to things you've created (e.g. a new feature on an app/tool you've shared in the past)
- Twitter accounts if you tweet regularly and tweet useful, actionable, market-related things
- Market-related posts you've written on other subs, or subs you think deserve more exposure
- Other content you think is valuable even if it's not your own

**Content you CANNOT share**:

- Referral links of any kind. This is a place to share your own content which you have created **yourself**, not to shill your RH/Webull/Amazon links or spam someone else's service for kickbacks. You will be permanently banned if you do this.
- Instagram accounts, these are just dumb and useless for market analysis
- Surveys - these are just annoying...you're basically an internet telemarketer
- **Anything** that could be interpreted as an effort to pump any stock/crypto/etc
- P/L screenshots/low effort ""sub to my service!""/""LOOK AT MY GAINZ!1!!"" crap. No one cares about your paper trading gainz or believes they're real. No one wants to hear your hot alerts for mad tendies. Share something useful and don't be another spammy furu taking advantage of newbies
- Anything else not on the list of content you CAN share. If you have something that doesn't fit here, message us and ask first.

##**CONCLUSION**

In general, think of these threads not as a place to promote yourself, but a place to share content that you genuinely believe people will find value in. If it's valuable, the exposure you seek will come naturally. Our goal is to improve the quality of the content of the sub by seeing what's out there that we currently don't allow, and simultaneously reward contributors of quality content for their efforts. **If you have something awesome, show it to us and tell us why we should love it.** I'm hoping that by providing people with a dedicated place to share their content it will a) improve the content quality of the sub and b) further cut down on spam/promotion outside this thread...let's see how that works out!

In the future this post will be MUCH shorter and I'll move the rules into a wiki or something, but wanted to brain dump everything here for now.

First of all thanks for all the tips you guys are sharing on a daily basis.  
I've got lump sum of money I would like to invest wisely long-term and I'm looking for the best possible advice. I was thinking about dividend-yielding stocks and reinvesting the yield. A few things to be taken into consideration:

  
\- I am currently living in the UK and will soon (6 months?) be moving to Poland.  
\- I need my investment to be tax efficient.  
\- Lowest fees possible as far as investment platform is concerned.  
\- Automated dividend reinvestment.  
\- Possible to withdraw at any given point (if I really need to).

I was thinking about top 50 dividend yielding stocks from S&amp;P500 with lowest volatility . But that is just my initial thought - any other suggestions are welcome.

However, if I decide to sell 5 shares at $25 and receive $125 how would I calculate the capital gains and pay the capital gains tax.

I'm asking about ""limited margin"" which is a feature you can have enabled on certain IRAs so you can avoid the T+2 settled funds delay.

Only marginable securities can be purchased on limited margin.  

For limited margin is there a distinction between stocks that are fully marginable (30%) and say leveraged ETFs (SPXS, SPXL, DPST etc) that are marginable at 75%?

In Street Smart Edge if I try to purchase something I know is non marginable (100%) such as a VIX etf I'll see a caution at the bottom of the long list of warnings on the order confirmation screen that it is non marginable but I see no such warning for SPXS, SPXL, DPST etc.

I've got inconsistent answers to above from Schwab brokers at their 1-800# (brokers who were conferenced in, not first line support).  They said to call options department to verify on Tuesday which I'll do but was curious in advance.

Funnily enough a large short (1%) appeared a month back on this company, at a time when it was doing well, uptrending, and sales figures (due to cashing in on Covid-19)  would make it look like the share price would be ding well around late Sept's AGM, around when you'd expect a Trading Update to happen.

Anyway, should the short magically begin to close around mid Sept to Oct, the share price would get a nice boost (this its a low float stock by the way, on the junior market).

nvidia gpus also focus on raytracing and DLSS. neither of which amd has good solution for (since nvidia is the pioneer in this). DLSS is witch craft, able to easily double the FPS in games. it simply makes no more sense to buy amd gpu any more. plus nvidia has better drivers, as always.

and dont  forget the Samsung deal. nvidia's able to reduce price on 3000 series cards due to samsung offering very cheap price, rumor is half of what TSMC offers. this means much higher margins when it reports next earnings. the EPS gonna go through the roof. 

cloud gaming is booming. its a new industry that analysts expect to grow to 5 billion industry in just a few years. nvidia is including a 1 year free GFN subscription with 3000 series purchase by the way, in order to further kickstart the cloud gaming business. cloud gaming is bascially video game streaming, like netflix. so if netlifx get crazy valuation even though its only a pure play in streaming, why cant nvidia? 

data center business is growing strong. it surpassed gaming revenue for the first time. the AI business will continue to be a secular trend. we're living increasingly in a digital world. think of all the surveilllence system, what do you think power them to do facial recognization? its the GPUs. china's been expanding its police state and will only require even more GPUs to do the tasks and the rest of the world will follow too. 

once nvidia finish the ARM aquision, it will have CPU capabilities just like intel and amd. and ARM cpus has been growing stronger every year. nvidia, being a new player in the CPU space, gonna compete against intel data center business by releasing cheaper cpus. 

also, nvidia has superb software. its CUDA ecosystem is industry standard. its very hard to break away from an ecosystem. CUDA is to AI what microsoft office is to office work. amd and intel are not gonna be able to take its place.

-take into account overall market and any hype on the stock. If it looks mostly positive continue. If it looks neutral, continue with caution

-look at greeks&amp;IV along with stock trends over the past 3 months &amp; 1 year. If all looks decent proceed to purchase a call.

-purchase a call option in my price range with the lowest vega and closest to current market price possible that extends beyond earnings date.

Stocks continued falling on Friday after a sell-off yesterday led the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ to close their worst session in months. Remarkably, however, benchmarks and big tech companies were able to rebound from deep in the red to finish the day modestly red. However, in context we are amid an incredible rally off the COVID-induced lows in March.

The S&amp;P finished the day 1.06% down, the Nasdaq 1.97% down, and the Dow 0.74% down.

At one point, the Nasdaq fell as much as 5% paring losses, as the pullback in tech stocks continued. The index is now firmly below the 12,000, after crossing that threshold for the first time on Wednesday. Interestingly, energy, utilities, and financial sectors outperformed the broader, falling no more than 1.6% each.

“Thursday’s mini-crash left the door open for more selling, and investors have rushed through it today in a hurry to take profits before more downside arrives,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.

The market ran out of steam and encountered heavy profit-taking to form a pullback. These pullbacks are healthy and allow the stage for investors to average down or enter new positions.

Thursday’s plunge came in absence of a clear external catalyst, with newly released data on weekly jobless claims topping expectations Thursday morning, hitting single digit unemployment rate of 8.4% vs estimates of 10.2%. Furthermore, developments around a coronavirus vaccine candidate seem to be going well with the CDC announcing to states to prepare for a vaccine distribution by Nov 1. This is in contrast to the WHO making a release today with a new model that projects 1.9M more deaths by end of 2020 due to COVID.

On other fronts mail-in voting will go ahead as planned. The stimulus talks still seem to be going nowhere with Democrats and Republicans unable to agree on the terms. This morning economic adviser Larry Kudlow, in an interview with Bloomberg, said that “we can absolutely live with it (coronavirus)” and “the economy is on a self-sustaining path to recovery… and will continue along those lines to surprise on the upside”. This was in response to a question of what would happen in case Democrats and Republicans could not agree on a package by years end.

**Highlights**

* After beginning the day deeply in the red, big tech stocks were mostly able to recover

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 7th, 2020.

# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday’s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**
*****
&gt; The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday’s market comeback.
*****
&gt; Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.
*****
&gt; After August’s 7% gain in the S&amp;P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.
*****
&gt; “I think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “In August, we did take a little bit off the table.”
*****
&gt; Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday’s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.
*****
&gt; # Froth blowing off
&gt; The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.
*****
&gt; One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was “gunning the market” makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.
*****
&gt; “It’s just a trip to the casino,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “If they’re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you’ve turned into a hedge fund.”
*****
&gt; JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.
*****
&gt; “The significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,” noted JPMorgan analysts. “But a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. “It’s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it’s going to be a sideways kind of market,” Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; “We’re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,” said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&amp;P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&amp;P is up 63%,” said Emanuel.

&gt; # Small Caps Best Day After Labor Day

&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.16% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last eight years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last three years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 42.9% of the time with an average gain of 0.13%.

&gt; # Big August: Bullish or Bearish?

&gt; Big August 2020 logged the 4th biggest August percent gain for the S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and the 6th biggest since 1930. But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&amp;P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding “Best Six Months” November-April.

&gt; Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).

&gt; Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.

&gt; # Analyzing the Jobs Report

&gt; The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren’t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.

&gt; This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don’t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.

&gt; The big surprise in today’s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.

&gt; “This was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let’s not get too excited, but we’ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn’t appear any different.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today’s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.

&gt; Last, don’t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (’82 and ’09) both saw some weakness right around now.

&gt; # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.

&gt; First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn’t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we’d classify as a bull market.

&gt; Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Now let’s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

*****

&gt; “What might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.

&gt; # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year

&gt; What a month August has been so far, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.

&gt; “Well, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?”

&gt; As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950. Additionally, the last two times August was up more than 5% were 1986 and 2000; the S&amp;P 500 fell 8.5% and 5.4% in September those years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Breaking things down by just an election year shows that August actually tends to be strong. That obviously played out this year, but now will the weakness we usually see in September and October play out?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Finally, after today, the S&amp;P 500 will be up 5 consecutive months. Looking at the other years that saw a similar summer rallies, there tended to be more strength the final 4 months of the year, with only the Federal Reserve policy mistake of December 2018 blemishing this impressive track record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chaert-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Yes, this record equity run is extremely stretched, but we would continue to use any pullbacks as an opportunity to add to longer-term core equity holdings, as the economy continues to come back quicker than most expected.

I am relatively new to investing, started little after the initial outbreak (sometimes late March), but I have been studying stocks and investing slowly and progressively. I intend to study and invest more as I move out throughout my life. Initially, I didn't know anything about investing, so I sold and purchased at the smallest profit I could make. I didn't know about short-term capital gain tax(?) until recently (so sorry ya'll. dumb move. stocks should never be hold for short term gain). Stocks will never be my primary source of income, and I am well aware of this but thought that saving money and learning more about market/economy/stocks are a lot more efficient way to spend my money and time than to... you know purchase useless things I don't need. I invested around 1K, but am planning on investing $500(?) more today or next week as well as about a $150 every other week (on a budget).

I know that not everyone on reddit are professionals, but there are also a lot of different people from diverse backgrounds who have WAYYYYYY more experience than someone like me. I was hoping for some advices on my portfolio as well as advices, cautions, and other perhaps surprises I should be aware of going into stocks. It would be amazing to lend some of your precious times to help a newbie out, and I apologize for asking lots of dumb questions. Any sort of advice would be absolutely great! Thank you!

Current Portfolio:

DAL and UAL (25%), JPM, RKT, AMD (35%), VTD

I used to heavily believe airlines will rise again so had invested a lot into it when it was relatively cheap... I am having mix feelings though with the government cutting back on aid packages upcoming month for the airline industries and whether they will ever recover back from this in the long term.

Do you suggest that I just completely sell everything (when prices are little higher for airlines) and just invest in other sectors? Sorry if this is a really stupid question.

Some Questions:

1) What are some good ways to learn more about investing? I have a very simple, basic foundation but want to learn more. youtube.. investopedia? I'm not sure where to continue.

2) What are some things to look out for to see potential growths when purchasing stocks?

3) I also started with robinhood, but see some limits. What are some other brokers that are  commission free with larger range of stocks and freedom? webull, fidelity?

4) What is the concept of ""splitting"" with apple and tesla? Is it simply just splitting the value of a single stock into smaller stocks, so people can buy more of it? Like is it a marketing mechanism by companies so they can try to get people to invest more by lowering the prices of a single stock?

5) Other sectors or potential stocks you guys recommend? Since I'm new should I just stick with exchange funds? I want to diversify more into other sectors. Could you recommend perhaps some sectors I should dive more into or keep away until I have more experience?

Triad Pro’s small-scale, localized, distributed generators provide lower cost electricity and higher power reliability compared to their outdated counterparts.

Their generators drive small power plants to provide energy onsite with little reliance on the distribution and transmission grid. Larger, centralized power plants often run on coal, oil, or nuclear power, and are frequently located far from the end users. This means longer transmission distances, greenhouse gas emissions, production of nuclear waste, and serious potential for power loss through transporting energy over long distances.

Triad Pro Innovators, in its Energy Production division, owns and operates distributed combined heat and power (CHP) energy projects that are fueled by clean-burning natural gas. These units are located onsite at customers’ facilities and they produce electricity, as well as heat, and/or chilled water under long-term multi-year contracts. Co-generation makes two or three uses of a single burn of clean fuel, lowering emissions and increasing efficiency far beyond traditional power plants.

$TPII is extremely undervalued at $0.02/share and &lt;$1 million market cap. The future with their co-generation and eCell technology is bright and they are developing additional applications as we speak.

Recent job cut announcements by companies clearly indicate, however, that more white-collar jobs are on the chopping block.

“When you see layoffs in management and corporate jobs, it’s a pure indicator of the economic impact of the recession, rather than just the lockdown, since many of these jobs can be done from home and they aren’t necessarily impacted by the lockdown orders,” said Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao. “It’s an indicator that there’s a traditional recession happening beneath the surface of this public health crisis.”

“The timing [of ongoing layoffs] is demonstrative here. The fact that these layoffs are happening now indicate that companies are revising expectations of how quickly we can return to economic normal,” said Zhao. “ It’s a sign of...some increasing pessimism about the rate of the recovery.”",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,516646,public,confidence,self,Job cuts come for white-collar workers: 'There are no truly recession-proof' occupations,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ime23s/job_cuts_come_for_whitecollar_workers_there_are/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Memorial Day and the July 4th holiday weekends proved to be a critical weekend where American's stopped social distancing and spread COVID-19 like wildfire.

We're heading into the Labor Day long holiday weekend which will likely be another pivotal moment in the spread of the virus and recovering the US economy.

Yesterday's selloff was a signal the market is not confident American's will do the right thing this weekend.

Watching job numbers this morning, futures are higher but markets could fall again quickly. I'll be using tight stops and locking in profits quickly today.
