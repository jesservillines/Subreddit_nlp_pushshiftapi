The recent primary in Argentina led to stocks crashing big time in Argentina. Looking at the prices over the last 5 years, a lot of these have crashed to their lowest in that time. Or very near to it. 

I always try to follow global politics and figure out interesting buying opportunities based on reactionary sell-offs, but I'll admit I don't know much about Argentina. I know inflation has been high and any of these stocks would obviously pose a risk. But seems like most of them would climb again. 

$EDN - Electric power company in Buenos Aires, down over 50%. From around $18 to under $8 now. Lowest its been in 5 years.

$SUPV - holding company that does banking. Also down over 50%. From around $7 to under $3.50 now. Went public about 3 years ago and this is an all time low. 

$BBAR - Oldest private bank in Argentina. Down over 50%. Was hovering in the $11-$12 range. Now, sits below $5.50. Also, lowest price in 5 years.

First time posting here so hopefully this is okay. 

My basis for shorting Walmart is both political and because of the nature of their business. 

Their highest grossing section is groceries if I recall. They’re facing stiff competition there from aldis publix, Krogers, Giant and a host of other grocery stores. 

Walmart to my understanding is a business that survives off of low margin profit. As in most items they sell give them small margins which do add up. 

However, it’s those small margins I believe which are going to bite them. Walmart relies on Federal subsidies for profits as in most of their employees do not make enough money and thus need food Stamps, housing assistance, or some other kind of aid to survive. 

This takes us to politics. Normally a company like Walmart does very well with Republican administrations exhibit A would be the corporate tax cuts, however Trump is determined to keep increasing tariffs on China. These tariffs do impact different company’s bottom lines and Walmart imports a lot from China. Anyone who shops there can attest to this. 

Now, on the other side of the political spectrum are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who in my opinion are the respective 2nd and 3rd place runners in the run up for the democratic nomination. Both of them along with any New Democrats elected to Congress would push for a minimum wage increase directly hitting Walmart’s bottom line at least short term. I think that many of those losses could be made up through increased sales, but it wouldn’t translate over the course of one or two quarters. Workers who get paid more tend to spend more. 

Even if Joe Biden wins which is not unlikely many democratic states are looking to pass minimum wage laws while Trump is increasing tariffs in the short term putting a double source of potential losses on Walmart. 

Also if Joe Biden wins, things like food standards will at the very least be raised back to what they were pre-Trump. (I consider Biden as somewhat economically conservative more so than Obama)

This in turn would raise the price of food in the U.S again hitting Walmart’s margins. 

I’m hoping to put a small position on 3-6 month puts for a couple hundred dollars. So far I’ve been reasonably successful with my stock investments but am definitely looking to learn more. 

I would greatly appreciate any feedback or criticisms. I follow nasdaq companies and politics very closely but I don’t look too closely at retail.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,391251,public,self,Shorting Walmart,0,1565755944,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cp4w1i/shorting_walmart/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 12th, 2019.

# **Week ahead could bring more volatility as worries over trade and the economy linger  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/09/week-ahead-could-bring-more-volatility-as-worries-over-trade-and-the-economy-linger.html)**
*****
&gt; After a whipsawing week, stocks could face more volatile swings as investors assess new information on trade and the strength of the economy.
*****
&gt; There are just a few earnings in the week ahead with Walmart, Cisco Systems,Nvidia and Deere reporting as the second-quarter earnings season winds down.
*****
&gt; Some pretty important economic reports are coming, however, spread across the week, with CPI inflation data Tuesday, and a load of key reports Thursday, including retail sales, PCE inflation data, industrial production and regional Fed surveys.
*****
&gt; But it is the behavior of the stock markets investors will be watching. It will be important to see how stocks react to variables like the level of Treasury yields and Chinese currency, which could be a bellwether for trade talks should the Chinese central bank allow the yuan to lose much more value.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching to see what signal the stock market sends after outsized moves in both directions this week.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said he believes the worst is over and stocks could trade at their highs again by the end of the month.
*****
&gt; “I think what we went through was a retest of the May pullback and it ended up being successful,” he said. Stovall said he has been watching the sub industries of the S&amp;P 1500, and as of July 12, 91% were above their 50-day moving average, an unusually high number.
*****
&gt; But as of Monday, when stocks were cratering, just 10% were above their 50-day moving average.
*****
&gt; “That to me was an indication of a washout,” Stovall said. He added that it was also a rapid move to the 5% decline level from the peak, indicating the market could make a quick comeback.
*****
&gt; “We are probably coming out of this pullback, and we’ll probably get there quickly. History says we’ll get there by the end of the month, meaning by the end of the month we’ll probably close with a new all-time high,” he said.
*****
&gt; Despite additional losses on Friday, stocks regained most of the steep losses from earlier in the week. The Dow ended the week down 0.75%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished the week down 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. After Monday’s close, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 had plunged around 3% while the Nasdaq had lost 3.5%.
*****
&gt; But in the bond market, investors may continue to see the lowest yields in years. In the past week, Treasury yields moved lower in a dramatic global slideamid concerns about global growth and as the world’s central banks have been cutting interest rates.
*****
&gt; “Trade tensions have unambiguously caused global growth to slow down, U.S. growth to slow and caused inflation to decelerate. That’s quite clear. That’s all the White House,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields went on a wild ride in the past week, with the 10-year dipping as low as 1.59% from as high as 2.08% the week earlier.
*****
&gt; “We’re in the crazy time of the summer ... when volumes are thin, moves tend to be exaggerated. That’s probably what we should expect,” McCarthy said.
*****
&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the move in yields and to a drop in the Chinese yuan below a former red line level of 7 per dollar. Bond yields, in terms of basis points, last moved this fast right after President Donald Trump was elected.
*****
&gt; “As this things accelerate, the [bond] market has been dealing with known unknowns, and now you’re starting to see people worrying about unknown unknowns. We’re in dangerous territory,” said McCarthy. “There’ s a widespread perception that there’s a race to the bottom going on here in yields, and it’s not necessarily the U.S. that’s driving this. It’s the fact we’re the high yielding market.”
*****
&gt; As rates also fall on foreign sovereign debt, U.S. Treasurys, with a higher yield, look more attractive and lure buyers. Rates move opposite price, so yields move lower when prices turn higher.
*****
&gt; As for the Chinese currency, the market was surprised when China failed to defend it, allowing it to sink below 7 to the dollar. The move was seen as a reaction to the latest round of tariffs Trump threatened to impose on China, effective Sept. 1.
*****
&gt; “It’s really hard to make any kind of definitive material decision about what’s going on in China because there’s no verifiable data to work with,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “If the Chinese really have the capability to keep this from blowing up, they’re not going to let this blow up.”
*****
&gt; As for economic data, McCarthy said the CPI and retail sales data will be particularly important. “I think retail sales will be solid. Everything we see on the household side is good. CPI headline could be feisty. Gasoline prices will boost it by more than a tenth,” he said.

# Perfect ""Shrug"" Pattern Emerges for the S&amp;P 500

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ripped higher by nearly 2% yesterday on no significant news, and when combined with gains seen over the prior two days, the index gained back all of its losses from Monday’s 3% drop.

&gt; The technicals show a near perfect double bottom formed from the intraday lows on Monday and Wednesday. The 2,830 level proved to be very strong support that saw buyers step in just when things looked their bleakest this week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/intraday.png))**

&gt; To throw some levity into the mix, the intraday chart of the S&amp;P 500 over the last week has amazingly formed a perfect “shrug” pattern from the famous emoji that you’ve likely seen before in texts or on social media (especially if you have teenage kids)! A picture is certainly worth 1,000 words. Talk about the perfect description of this market!

# Another Summer Storm

&gt; U.S. stocks have hit another trade-induced summer storm.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index fell 3% on Monday, its worst day since December 2018. The index is now about 6% from record highs in U.S. stocks’ worst bout of volatility since May.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Storms Happen Often in U.S. Stocks, stock volatility this year has been relatively subdued compared to history. The S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 14% from peak to trough since 1990, and even in positive years, the index has dropped an average of 11% during the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gWgqf6z.png))**

&gt; “Though the volatility has been uncomfortable, it’s normal for U.S. stocks to endure periodic pullbacks,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “These experiences typically provide opportunities for suitable investors to rebalance, diversify portfolios toward targeted allocations, or to add to equity positions based on what we see as a generally favorable macroeconomic environment.”

&gt; Stocks’ recent sell-off has been especially brisk. Just 10 days ago on July 26, the S&amp;P 500 reached a new all-time high, bolstered by Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut hopes, improving economic data, and cooling trade tensions. Since then, the Fed’s rate cut and messaging wasn’t met with investor enthusiasm, the United States threatened tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods, and China pulled prior commitments to purchase U.S. agriculture goods. In addition, China’s central bank let its currency (the yuan) fall below the key 7 per dollar level that some view as a line in the sand relative to currency manipulation.

&gt; The fundamental picture for stocks hasn’t really changed, though. Economic growth has exceeded expectations, inflation and interest rates are low, and second quarter earnings have been better than expected. Trade uncertainty continues to weigh on global markets, but tariffs haven’t significantly affected the domestic economy and the Fed has indicated willingness to loosen policy as needed. While there are still geopolitical risks, including trade, a review of all of the above fundamentals suggests to us that the odds of an imminent recession are quite low.

&gt; We’ll continue to watch the trade and front monetary policy, along with their impacts to the U.S. dollar, economic output and corporate profit growth. For now, though, we see few reasons that suggest this market pullback will result in anything more than a typical correction, and we maintain our belief that the S&amp;P 500 is fairly valued in the range of 3,000 by year-end.

# Sticking to the Game Plan

&gt; Okay, so the market has been volatile the past two weeks reacting to the Fed rate cut and more so the U.S.-China trade dispute. But in reality this is precisely the typical summer, especially early-August, seasonal weakness we have been warning about, so we are not panicking, but that does not mean the market is out of the woods yet. There is still some technical work to be done.

&gt; At the risk of being repetitive, we remind you that the market continues to track the seasonal patterns closely, which suggests to us that it is likely to continue to do so. The chart below of the Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns clearly illustrates that despite somewhat greater amplitude DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have been following the seasonal trend this year. The late-July/early-August drop we just experienced came right on cue, which puts us on an upward trajectory through mid-September before another reversal into late-October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/08814bbc57f7fec02cea55d894aa0a47/44b1ab85c9708a41-64/s500x750/02cf4e5d162fae7663b1489043f7274f64042c91.jpg))**

&gt; But things will need to continue to get constructive technically soon or else further declines become a higher probability. In the next chart we have updated the technical support and resistance levels for the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; The Down Friday/Down Monday (DF/DM) broke through initial support at S&amp;P 2875 near the old January 2018 highs, but we held the next level of support at 2815 where the S&amp;P failed intraday back on November 7, 2018, before the December selloff, which was rather constructive. Today’s rally was further improvement, but we have yet to reclaim the level before this past DF/DM. The sooner we clear this new overhead resistance around 2955 near the May 1 intraday high and the close of Thursday August 1 just prior to this latest DF/DM, the better the technical picture will be.

&gt; If we cannot take out 2955 soon and then breach the next level of support the situation begins to look like the beginning of the selloff last October. Support at 2775 runs through several gaps and consolidations, but the next level of support around 2725 where we held in early June is important. 2650 is minor support below there, but critical support sits at the old February/April 2018 lows 2580.

&gt; If we can retake 2955 in short order then we would expect the market to drift higher into mid-September, perhaps logging minor new highs.

# August Summer Market Storms Are Common

&gt; Mild summer market storms like we are experiencing so far this August have been a common occurrence over the years. After the banner rally we have been having this type of selloff should not be surprising. However, from our analysis of Down Augusts, it can get dicey for the rest of the year if August losses deepen and if September is down as well. You can see in the tables below that the market has usually weathered these typical mild August market declines in stride. It’s mostly the larger losses at the top of the list accompanied by losses in September that have nasty market years. Years like 2019 with big gains year-to-date at the end of July that had August market storms fared better.

Looking at their 10k I noticed that they had a slightly bad  year in 2018, the number are in millions but they were at were 8,265.3mil in 2018 and 8,547.1mil in 2017. 

They also didn't raise their dividend from 2017 keeping it at 1.52$

Their risks sections doesn't seem to have anything truly alarming just stating that they need to keep up with the times and are very dependent on their suppliers of merch and what not. It came off like a risk just to put a risk down.

I'm asking because gamestop has been known to be a crooked company that treats its employees like garbage but their Financials don't look that bad at all and the drop in stock might be just media hysteria.

Eventually people will forget and then it will pick back up.

I'm in a place where I could definitely use some extra money (would be less than 10% of portfolio), and would like to sell some stock, and I think I know what I'm doing, but because I've never sold, I want to know if there are any pitfalls that I should know to avoid, that etrade won't tell me about.

For instance I understand you get taxed on the stock when you sell it, so I guess I need to look at what the tax brackets are and plan accordingly. Want to know if there are concerns there.

**Galaxy Next Generation Inc. (OTC:GAXY)** is a provider of interactive learning technology solutions that allows the presenter and participant to engage in a fully collaborative instructional environment. 

📷

The company just the signing of a letter of intent to acquire a west coast based audio company focused on creating innovative products that provide fundamental tools used for building notification systems.

According to the release, the proposed acquisition is for a combination of cash and stock. The target company generated approximately $4 million in revenue through the twelve month period ending June 30, 2019. The targets products and services allow institutions access to intercom, scheduling and notification systems they use every day with improved ease of use. It provides an open architecture solution which allows its products to be used in many existing and new environments. Intercom, PA, Bell and control solutions are easily added and integrated with its first to market open architecture design and current software model. Its products combine elements not normally found together over a common IP network, which minimizes infrastructure requirements and reduces costs by combining systems. This strategy also places it at the forefront of school safety and communication.

Gary LeCroy, Galaxys Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are excited to add innovative audio technology to our product suite, as it is something that our end customers, especially in the K-12 market segment have been demanding. This is evident by their strong revenue growth in the first half of 2019. We believe this is the first company to provide an open architecture solution that allows existing components to be used and to look beyond the space of intercom to extend capabilities of the system for other applications. The proposed acquisition also has 4 patents pending and expands our geographical footprint to the west coast. We are looking forward to advancing this transaction to the definitive stage and expect to close by the end of September.

Galaxy does not control where resellers focus their resell efforts, although generally, the K-12 education market is the largest customer base for Galaxy products – comprising nearly 90% of Galaxy’s sales.

The company boasts a strong team, including its COO, who spent the majority of her young career at Mimio/Boxlight (NASDAQ:BOXL), a leader in the ed-tech and interactive display market. She performed many jobs at Mimio including, sales, federal programs director, and regional management.

With a tiny float of just 1.5 million shares, GAXY is sitting in a strong pattern with a recent hold of a key trendline and a number of clear support levels. That may demonstrate strong accumulation present under the surface of the tape. 

Several indicators agree with the strong upside potential here. This is the most speculative idea in this list of compelling ed-tech stories, but it may also have the most upside room to run as a result.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

- most environmentally friendly airline in Europe  and aiming to reduce CO2 emissions per passenger by a third in the coming years (I think a decade but I can’t remember)

If the people writing them were so good, then they wouldn't release the information, they would use investment strategies to take advantage of their research. 

All too often, these types of scammy newsletters can more easily be used to ""pump and dump"" stocks, or at the very least front-running stocks. You place a buy/sell position, then you publish research that favors your position, and you get other people to buy/sell, which then makes the originators of the claim more money. This is one of the big criticisms of companies like Citron Research, because while they occasionally find good reasons to short a company, they then publish their results, which can accelerate gains for themselves. 

As far as I can tell, there isn't much SEC oversight, which leaves ""financial advice/newsletters"" as a kind of legal grey area.

This is very different than how people like Jim Chanos or Mark Burry operated; they held their short position close because they knew the companies would fail despite what other investors did. (note: Jim Chanos is back on my radar for his activity surrounding Tesla and his promotion of his short on news programs (which could get other people to sell or short the stock)). If he really thought Tesla would fail on their own, he would quietly short it and not tell anyone.

Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.\n\nThe social media market\n\nWith over 2.41 billion monthly active users across Facebook and Messenger platforms, and over 2.7 billion monthly active users across all Facebook-owned platforms (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Facebook is a major player in the social media market, to say the least. Facebook is often accused of being a monopoly, but they do face fierce competition on many of their products and features. Messenger and WhatsApp compete head-to-head with Apple\'s iMessage and FaceTime in the messaging and private communication space. In the video space, Facebook Watch and Instagram\'s IGTV both pale in comparison to Youtube. However, Facebook\'s network effect does provide an enormous competitive advantage in the social media space, largely owing to their extraordinarily enormous user base. Firstly, it increases the ""stickiness"" of users. If you live in a developed country, chances are that you and many your friends rely on a Facebook-owned platform as a primary channel of communication, making it very inconvenient for anyone to leave the network. Once hailed as an archetypal Silicon Valley success story, Facebook has taken severe blows to their reputation after a series of privacy scandals. However, users are not leaving the platform. In fact, monthly active users have continued to grow steadily following the Cambridge Analytica scandal that first began reshaping public opinion around the social media giant. Users stick to the platform, perhaps because there is no other feasible place to go. Secondly, an enormous user base gives Facebook a huge advantage over other social platforms. For example, when Instagram decided to implement ""Stories"", a feature that had existed on Snapchat for over five years at the time, Snapchat was quickly out-competed. In less than one year, Instagram Stories had overtaken Snapchat Stories in active users. After two years, Instagram Stories had over twice as many users as Snapchat Stories, and Snapchat began to see a decline in users. This example demonstrates that when Facebook decides to enter a new space, they bring along an enormous existing user base, which gives them a competitive edge over smaller platforms.\n\nThe digital advertising market\n\nFacebook in its current form is a social media platform, but it is in the business of digital advertising. It competes with the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Verizon in the digital advertising space, as well as everyone in the traditional advertising space, since money spent on traditional advertising is money not spent advertising on Facebook. Fortunately for Facebook, digital ad spend as a proportion of total ad spend in the United States is trending upwards. In fact, it is expected that digital advertising will account for over half of all ad spend in 2019, making it the first year that advertisers spend more on digital media than traditional media. It is not difficult to see why advertisers are moving from traditional media to digital media. Digital advertising often provides higher conversion rates and more impressions at lower costs, ultimately producing a higher return on ad spend for marketers. Facebook can provide more effective advertising because their ad targeting is laser-focused. Where traditional media can make their best guess that your ad will be shown to 18-24 year old females in New York who are interested in beauty products, Facebook can be relatively certain of it, based on information that users provide them directly, as well as data that is collected through users\' activity both on and off the platform. They can also offer lower rates to advertisers due to the vast amount of ad inventory provided by their enormous user base. Additionally, digital media platforms typically provide better tools for ad campaign monitoring and analytics, which is important for marketers. With digital media, marketers can collect data in real-time and make changes and optimizations to their ad campaigns within minutes. This gives digital media an edge over traditional media, and Facebook is well-positioned to benefit from the inevitable shift from traditional to digital. Facebook currently sits at around 19% of total digital ad spend in the United States.\n\nCompetitive advantage\n\nFacebook\'s competitive advantage lies primarily in three areas: user base, data, and business success. As mentioned before, their vast user base creates a network effect that makes it extremely difficult to leave and tempts new users to join. Facebook has to spend relatively little to acquire new users in their established markets (which is most of the developed world), making them very difficult to compete against for new startups that have relatively high customer acquisition costs. Additionally, Facebook\'s data advantage allows them to create highly accurate and detailed profiles on their users, giving them a huge competitive edge over traditional media platforms and even other digital media platforms. Finally, despite being caught in political crosshairs, Facebook\'s vast profitability allows them to be relatively resilient in a hostile regulatory environment. Unlike Snapchat and many other tech startups that are not yet profitable and require constant capital injections from investors to sustain their operations, Facebook is a cash-generating machine. New legislation regarding privacy and security will likely be introduced in the near-future, and compliance often requires an increase in headcount as well as infrastructure modifications, which can cost significant amounts of capital. Therefore, smaller and less profitable institutions would be disproportionately affected by new regulations, assuming that the regulations are broad-reaching and do not single-out Facebook as the target.\n\nFacebook\'s financials\n\nFacebook\'s financial statements are the kind that Wall Street dreams about. Their balance sheet is pristine, with almost $50 billion in cash and only $13 billion in current liabilities, resulting in a cash-ratio of 3.75. Less than 25% of their assets are funded by debt, so they should face relatively less pressure during an economic downturn. Over the past five years, their earnings have grown over 600%, and they are continuing to grow, albeit at a slower rate. In the past twelve months, average revenue per user has grown by 18%, while total users have grown by 8%, leading to a revenue growth of 28% year over year. However, expenses are also ramping up as Facebook faces regulatory pressure to make improvements to their privacy and security infrastructure. As a result, operating margins have fallen from 44% in the second quarter of 2018 to 39% in 2019, leading to a modest operating income growth of 13% after adjusting for the recent fine from the Federal Trade Commission. One would hope that Facebook can eventually reduce the costs required to improve their infrastructure, as well as overcome the regulatory obstacles as to avoid excessive fines and settlements in the near future. Ideally, they would be able to do this while maintaining strong revenue growth, which does not seem to be a problem at the moment. This is particularly astounding considering the already-gargantuan size of Facebook.\n\nGrowth potential\n\nDespite having over one-third of the world in its network, Facebook\'s user count continues to grow at high single digits, although most of this growth comes from regions where Facebook does not monetize quite as well, such as Asia-Pacific and ""Rest of World"". In these regions, the average revenue per user is less than one-tenth of that in the United States and Canada. However, this presents a macroeconomic growth opportunity for Facebook – as these countries grow their economies, consumers will spend more and advertisers will spend more to attract these consumers. Therefore, in addition to a steadily growing user count in these markets, with time, the value of each user in these markets should grow too.\n\nMore macroeconomic growth potential lies in the year over year expansion of the global advertising market. Total advertising spend worldwide grows around 5% each year, and as mentioned before, digital advertising is taking a larger and larger portion of that spend. As a market leader in the digital advertising space, Facebook is well-positioned to benefit from these two macroeconomic trends.\n\nAside from macroeconomic tailwinds, there are still many adjustments that Facebook can make to its platforms to improve their top-line. In fact, much of Facebook\'s growth limitations are self-imposed. Facebook is very conscious about the user experience and is aware of how it can be impacted by advertisements. Therefore, when rolling out new ad products such as Facebook Stories ads, they will likely take their time and exercise caution, often testing out the feature in small markets and expanding slowly until they are confident that it will not impede too much on the user experience. Surprisingly, there are still no ads on Instagram\'s Explore Feed. Additionally, Messenger and WhatsApp are barely monetized. Each of these present opportunities to increase ad inventory, but we can expect Facebook to be patient and to roll out new ad products on these platforms slowly over time.\n\nFacebook is constantly releasing new products such as Libra, Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Dating, Facebook Watch and Instagram Checkout. If successful, such new products may meaningfully contribute to their top-line. Like Google, Facebook is also willing to make a few moonshot bets on new technology such as virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses. Only time will tell whether or not these investments will pay off.\n\nRisks\n\nCurrently, Facebook\'s biggest and most obvious risk lies in the current hostile political environment in which it operates, both in the United States and worldwide. The European Union has been constantly hammering on the tech giants for their privacy issues and anticompetitive behavior, implementing policies like GDPR and aggressively attacking them with fines, which, if continued, may have a materially negative impact on Facebook\'s profitability. Additionally, the United States government has also begun to take legal action against the tech giants, with bipartisan support. Facebook recently received a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission and is currently pending investigation from both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for potential anticompetitive behavior. The results of these investigations are to be seen, but any antitrust actions taken against Facebook could materially impact its operations.\n\nAdditionally, although the recent series of privacy and antitrust scandals have not seemed to meaningfully impact user count, it has seemed to negatively affect employee morale at Facebook. Surveys completed by employees at Facebook have not been as positive as in the past, and the company has seen ten of its top executives leave in 2018. If this trend continues, Facebook may find it difficult to attract and retain top talent and lose some of its competitive edge.\n\nValuation\n\nThe following discounted future earnings model makes the following assumptions: Facebook\'s earnings will grow at 15% year over year for five years starting January 2019; it will have a price/earnings ratio of 16 at the end of this period; and the investor demands an 11% annualized return during this period. Discounting future earnings under these assumptions, Facebook\'s present value is $422 billion. It\'s current market capitalization is $550 billion, meaning that the stock is currently overvalued under these assumptions. However, any model is only as good as its inputs, and even a small change in expected earnings growth, terminal price/earnings ratio or discount rate could have a significant impact on the present value. Whether or not you should to invest in Facebook at these prices will depend on your own expected future value and required rate of return.\n\nConclusion\n\nFacebook is a remarkable business that has grown its revenue and earnings at an extraordinary rate over the last few years. There is still plenty of room to grow, but whether or not the growth materializes will depend on macroeconomic factors, regulatory outcomes and Facebook\'s ability to effectively execute on their vision. Facebook\'s fundamentals are strong, but with an adjusted price/earnings ratio of 24, and a price/book value of 6, it seems that this strength is already somewhat reflected in the market value of the stock.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the recent controversy surrounding Facebook, today we are going to analyze Facebook&amp;#39;s business fundamentals, growth potential, risks, valuation, and ultimately decide whether or not it makes sense to be a shareholder of the social media giant. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The social media market&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With over 2.41 billion monthly active users across Facebook and Messenger platforms, and over 2.7 billion monthly active users across all Facebook-owned platforms (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Facebook is a major player in the social media market, to say the least. Facebook is often accused of being a monopoly, but they do face fierce competition on many of their products and features. Messenger and WhatsApp compete head-to-head with Apple&amp;#39;s iMessage and FaceTime in the messaging and private communication space. In the video space, Facebook Watch and Instagram&amp;#39;s IGTV both pale in comparison to Youtube. However, Facebook&amp;#39;s network effect does provide an enormous competitive advantage in the social media space, largely owing to their extraordinarily enormous user base. Firstly, it increases the &amp;quot;stickiness&amp;quot; of users. If you live in a developed country, chances are that you and many your friends rely on a Facebook-owned platform as a primary channel of communication, making it very inconvenient for anyone to leave the network. Once hailed as an archetypal Silicon Valley success story, Facebook has taken severe blows to their reputation after a series of privacy scandals. However, users are not leaving the platform. In fact, monthly active users have continued to grow steadily following the Cambridge Analytica scandal that first began reshaping public opinion around the social media giant. Users stick to the platform, perhaps because there is no other feasible place to go. Secondly, an enormous user base gives Facebook a huge advantage over other social platforms. For example, when Instagram decided to implement &amp;quot;Stories&amp;quot;, a feature that had existed on Snapchat for over five years at the time, Snapchat was quickly out-competed. In less than one year, Instagram Stories had overtaken Snapchat Stories in active users. After two years, Instagram Stories had over twice as many users as Snapchat Stories, and Snapchat began to see a decline in users. This example demonstrates that when Facebook decides to enter a new space, they bring along an enormous existing user base, which gives them a competitive edge over smaller platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The digital advertising market&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook in its current form is a social media platform, but it is in the business of digital advertising. It competes with the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Verizon in the digital advertising space, as well as everyone in the traditional advertising space, since money spent on traditional advertising is money not spent advertising on Facebook. Fortunately for Facebook, digital ad spend as a proportion of total ad spend in the United States is trending upwards. In fact, it is expected that digital advertising will account for over half of all ad spend in 2019, making it the first year that advertisers spend more on digital media than traditional media. It is not difficult to see why advertisers are moving from traditional media to digital media. Digital advertising often provides higher conversion rates and more impressions at lower costs, ultimately producing a higher return on ad spend for marketers. Facebook can provide more effective advertising because their ad targeting is laser-focused. Where traditional media can make their best guess that your ad will be shown to 18-24 year old females in New York who are interested in beauty products, Facebook can be relatively certain of it, based on information that users provide them directly, as well as data that is collected through users&amp;#39; activity both on and off the platform. They can also offer lower rates to advertisers due to the vast amount of ad inventory provided by their enormous user base. Additionally, digital media platforms typically provide better tools for ad campaign monitoring and analytics, which is important for marketers. With digital media, marketers can collect data in real-time and make changes and optimizations to their ad campaigns within minutes. This gives digital media an edge over traditional media, and Facebook is well-positioned to benefit from the inevitable shift from traditional to digital. Facebook currently sits at around 19% of total digital ad spend in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Competitive advantage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook&amp;#39;s competitive advantage lies primarily in three areas: user base, data, and business success. As mentioned before, their vast user base creates a network effect that makes it extremely difficult to leave and tempts new users to join. Facebook has to spend relatively little to acquire new users in their established markets (which is most of the developed world), making them very difficult to compete against for new startups that have relatively high customer acquisition costs. Additionally, Facebook&amp;#39;s data advantage allows them to create highly accurate and detailed profiles on their users, giving them a huge competitive edge over traditional media platforms and even other digital media platforms. Finally, despite being caught in political crosshairs, Facebook&amp;#39;s vast profitability allows them to be relatively resilient in a hostile regulatory environment. Unlike Snapchat and many other tech startups that are not yet profitable and require constant capital injections from investors to sustain their operations, Facebook is a cash-generating machine. New legislation regarding privacy and security will likely be introduced in the near-future, and compliance often requires an increase in headcount as well as infrastructure modifications, which can cost significant amounts of capital. Therefore, smaller and less profitable institutions would be disproportionately affected by new regulations, assuming that the regulations are broad-reaching and do not single-out Facebook as the target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook&amp;#39;s financials&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook&amp;#39;s financial statements are the kind that Wall Street dreams about.

I'm wondering if I should sell it, or hold it. What would you guys do, and why?

Several law firms are opening investigations into the fact that they may have made misleading financial statements and now the stock has crashed nearly 50% this past week and seems to keep going down a dollar every day. They are not turning a profit yet but neither are plenty of other companies that do well.

On the positive side they are a somewhat unique company (subscription based online IT education) with no publicly traded competitors.

Im currently forming what i believe is a perfect longterm portfolio and i'd like to have your opinion on it but before i'll get into it i want you to know that this is a longterm portfolio and by that i mean 35+ years and it will also take time to manage it.

*Portfolio Setup (Procentage of money distributed)*

* 15 stocks *(Medium Risk) 72,5%* 
* 5 Dividend stocks *(Low Risk) 20% (Passive income)* 
* 5 Stocks *(High Risk) 7,5% (Companies with new products i believe can make it)  ""NO GAMBLING""*

 *(I'll start with funds later in life to have some safer investments)*

The portfolio contains of 25 stocks and I guess this looks idiotic according to a majority of having so many securities since there is definitely alot more work that has to be done but that's what i like doing, i've probably spent 5 - 8 hours/day since i started investing so don't worry about me managing all these securities and since it's longterm i don't have read every quarterly rapport.

Industry Distribution is currently something im still working on but what do you think about this portfolio and if you'd change anything, what would it be?

I have a relatively small position in $SWCH, 48 shares.  Started at $7.70 and averaged up a couple times, landing me at a cost basis of $8.02/share.

Honestly, I didn't know much about their business model at the time and started my position on the facts that they were building innovative facilities worth billions, and they had some big name clients like Apple and Google as well as government agencies.  Figured they wouldn't be spending billions if they didn't have a good plan.  Not necessarily the best reasoning to start a position, but it's paid off so far.

It's been a pretty slow growing stock, but it's steady.  Big jumps on earnings, then trades relatively flat until the next call.  They also pay a dividend, which is nice.

I'd be interested to hear some of your thoughts on how big this company can get, and where its stock's ceiling may be.

Okay I watched Bernie last night on Joe Rogan and he brought up the Wall Street 1/2 of 1% speculation tax.

Obviously this isn’t law yet or even completely outlined but I’ve read that this is sold as hurting the high frequency trading on Wall Street but that it will essentially be a tax on all trades. In the past people on this sub have mentioned it would hit all trades stocks and significantly hurt those owning mutual funds.

Is this true and how would the real numbers work?

How often do mutual fund managers rebalance their mutual funds and ETFs? Is it everyday? Every week? Once a month?

If it could be everyday, and maybe that idea is absurd, if my math is correct, a $10k portfolio taxed at .001% every time the entire portfolio is rebalanced could be $3650 in taxes per year (rebalanced every day) or $120 of rebalanced only once a month.

If you take the $120 amount, that still 1.2% every year to taxes which doesn’t sound like a lot but is a significant amount year to year esp if you have fees associated with the fund as well.

Anyone able to explain this better because I’m sure I’m calculating this wrong. What is the biggest hit Bernie’s high frequency tax would cause on the normal, small holdings investor (aka lower to middle class)?

Edit: also, I assume this tax wouldn’t affect 401ks or Roth IRAs right?

**Instructure Inc (NYSE:INST)** bills itself as a company that provides applications for learning, assessment, and performance management through a software-as-a-service business model worldwide. 

It develops Canvas, a learning management platform for K-12 and higher education; and Bridge, an employee development and engagement platform. 

The company’s applications enhance academic and corporate learning by providing a system of engagement for teachers and learners, enabling frequent and open interactions, a streamlined workflow, and the creation and sharing of content with anytime, anywhere access to information. Its platform also provides data analytics that enable real-time reaction to information and benchmarking in order to personalize curricula and goal setting; and enhance the efficacy of the learning, assessment, and performance management processes. The company was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The company’s latest earnings showed a positive long-term trend toward sustainable financial results. Shares of the stock are testing their 200-day SMA right now, potentially offering an interesting opportunity to new money looking for exposure in the space.

**Galaxy Next Generation Inc. (OTC:GAXY)** is a provider of interactive learning technology solutions that allows the presenter and participant to engage in a fully collaborative instructional environment. 

Galaxy’s products include Galaxy’s own private-label interactive touch screen panel as well as numerous other national and international branded peripheral and communication devices. Galaxy’s distribution channel consists of 22+ resellers across the U.S. who primarily sell the Company’s products within the commercial and educational market. 

Galaxy does not control where resellers focus their resell efforts, although generally, the K-12 education market is the largest customer base for Galaxy products – comprising nearly 90% of Galaxy’s sales.

The company boasts a strong team, including its COO, who spent the majority of her young career at Mimio/Boxlight (NASDAQ:BOXL), a leader in the ed-tech and interactive display market. She performed many jobs at Mimio including, sales, federal programs director, and regional management.

The biggest recent news for the stock comes in the form of its announcement that, as a result of its recent participation as an exhibitor at GAMEIS, in Savannah, GA, it has signed AIOS Group LLC as a value-add reseller.

According to the release, AIOS Group LLC, of Canton GA, has already successfully onboarded and is now active as a Galaxy reseller. Gary LeCroy, Galaxys Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We continue to expand our presence, especially in the K-12 classroom. Our new products were well received at GAMEIS and its always great to achieve immediate success from a tradeshow or conference by signing a new reseller. We look forward to having AIOS Group represent our products and expand our market share.”

With a tiny float of just 10.4 million shares, GAXY is always primed for big upside potential simply due to a scarcity function in the open market. That feature was on full display six weeks ago when the stock rallied over 75% in three days in a powerful squeeze. Technically, we believe the current pattern supports the potential for a similar move if the stars line up right. And right now, that recipe could be in place.

The stock is also testing key trend line support right now at a higher level than it tested in June and earlier this year, resulting in a nice upward trend going through a pullback. The MACD indicator is flashing a green light as the pullback ripens, so it might be just the time to give this stock a fresh look.

**Boxlight Corp (NASDAQ:BOXL)** promulgates itself as an education technology company that develops, sells, and services interactive classroom solutions for the education market worldwide. 

The company provides a range of interactive classroom technology products primarily targeted at the K-12 education market. Its products include interactive projectors, interactive flat panel displays, interactive touch projectors, touchboards, and MimioTeach that could turn any whiteboard interactive; and accessory document cameras, teacher pads for remote control, and assessment systems. 

The company also offers MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software that enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities; and MimioMobile, a software accessory for MimioStudio. In addition, it offers interactive touch tables and whiteboards; and peripherals and accessories, such as amplified speaker systems, mobile carts, installation accessories, and wall-mount accessories for interactive and standard projectors, and LED flat panels. 

Further, the company distributes interactive projectors and LED flat panels; and science, technology, engineering, and math data logging products. The company was formerly known as Logical Choice Corporation. Boxlight Corporation was incorporated in 2014 and is headquartered in Lawrenceville, Georgia.

The company just announced that Clayton County Public Schools (CCPS), Georgia’s fifth-largest school district, has initiated a comprehensive professional development program with a multi-method approach for online, onsite and consultancy training within its whole-class learning solution. During the 2019-20 academic year, Boxlight’s subsidiary EOS Education (EOS), a professional development provider for the K-12 education market, will provide a comprehensive program of training, professional development and ongoing support for CCPS educators. These three programs will be integrated in order to facilitate the educator’s effective implementation of Boxlight classroom solutions and to provide those teachers with the necessary skills, knowledge, and best practices regarding usage of available technologies in their classroom.

Previously, in the spring of 2018, Boxlight was the chosen solution for an $18 million digital classroom refresh project in CCPS, to install its innovative Mimio classroom solution suite in approximately 3,200 classrooms, comprised of 38 elementary, 15 middle and 12 high schools. The installation was completed at the end of February 2019.

**Part One: China Exposure**

What's the reason for today's drop? RMB.USD hitting 7.00, right? Well, the reason that particular currency pair had the effect it has had on the US market is explained [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cmdjtv/how_does_the_yuan_devaluation_impact_the_us/) Basically, it affects companies that have operations in China, as in companies that sell goods to China, from the US. Well, MA doesn't have that. [It has no China exposure.](https://qz.com/1539255/visa-and-mastercard-still-cant-enter-china/) [Second source.](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139119000128/ma06302019-10xq.htm) (Search for China/Asia with cmd + F/Ctrl + F)

**Part Two: The Numbers**

So why did it drop? Beta. MA currently has a relatively low Beta of [0.88](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA/) meaning for every percent the S&amp;P drops, MA should drop 0.88%. So when the S&amp;P dropped 2.93% today one would have expected MA to drop 2.57%, right? Well, it didn't. MA is currently [down 4.68%](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ:MA). This – from my perspective – is quite a nice arbitrage opportunity. Now, it is entirely possible for markets to continue dropping, however, should they do so, I believe MA to be the last stock to do so, precisely because of the numbers I just gave.

One might then ask: ""Why did MA drop today in the first place?"" To that, I would say that the market regularly overreacts to news such as this. Now, it could very well be that the market continues to overreact to the general market news, by applying the same standards to MA, as it does to a company with a lot more China exposure, say AAPL. But that is a risk one must take.

**Part Three: Why MA**

""So why would you take the risk with MA, rather than with any other low China-exposure stock?"" Well, for one, I'm already exposed to V; but more generally, it is the highest-valuation, safest, and best-run company with no China-exposure I could find. It had quite a good ER on 30 July with the CEO, Ajay Banga, saying:

&gt;“We continue to execute well against our strategy and had another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth,""  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are driving growth in our core products with key wins around the globe, and our recent acquisitions, such as Transfast, and new partnerships, like P27 in the Nordics, will help us address our customers’ evolving payments needs, particularly in the areas of real-time account-to-account and cross-border payments.”

Combing through the numbers a bit, you can see quite a nice balance sheet and again, *no China-exposure.*

**Part Four: The Trade** 

My position is as follows: [Long @ 262.49; Stop Loss @ 255; Take Profit (Manually) @ 280](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ:AAPL)

**Part Five: tl;dr**

1. MA has no China-exposure, which is the reason for (now yesterday's) drop. MA
2. MA dropped more than its Beta would have seen rational
3. MA had a good ER on 30 Jul, making this drop even more irrational
4. MA is (now) heading in the right direction again, but it's not too late, imo.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,388439,public,self,Long NYSE:MA – No China Exposure – Meaningless Drop – Good ER – 1 Month Trade,0,1565195827,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cmswm4/long_nysema_no_china_exposure_meaningless_drop/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

I don’t plan on exercising a put contract because I have no reason to, but I’m just curious if you keep the profit if you can’t sell it by the expiration date, but it’s price has grown to a profit by the expiration date and stays there through it.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

“Secretary Mnuchin, under the auspices of President Trump, has today determined that China is a Currency Manipulator,” the Treasury Department said in a release. “As a result of this determination, Secretary Mnuchin will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions.”

The formal designation — the first since President Bill Clinton’s administration in 1994 — came after China on Monday allowed its currency to breach a psychological level.

“In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past,” the Treasury Department added. “The context of these actions and the implausibility of China’s market stability rationale confirm that the purpose of China’s currency devaluation is to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade.”

The yuan fell to 7 against the dollar earlier in the session for the first time since 2008.

“I think many people in the private sector may not conclude it is a currency manipulator. The key rule is it’s not intervening consistently or persistently to weaken the currency and therefore the private sector, like economists and strategists may not be convinced,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn.

“This is another step in the currency war,” he added. “This also makes trade more difficult. This is probably bi-partisan. Many Republicans and Democrats think china is taking advantage of us.”

 Nobody really knows what the market will do, but there's something I do I'd like to share. Check your portfolio and see if it's been falling MORE or LESS as a percentage of the S&amp;P 500 the last few days. If it's less, there's no reason to worry, you know the S&amp;P will stop falling somewhere, most likely at half the size of the gain since last December 24, but possibly all the way back to the December low--or even lower. But it always rises again, so you're not in any real trouble and may even benefit by dollar-cost averaging. 

If your portfolio is declining MORE than the S&amp;P, and especially if you're using margin or playing options, you own a lot of volatile stocks!

.

&gt;forecast of 3.5% unemployement in USA to 4.8% 2023-2028(Fed's target is 6.7%)

.

&gt;The unemployment rate in Canada rose to 5.5 percent in June of 2019

.

&gt;U.S. GDP growth will slow to 2.1% in 2019 from 3% in 2018. It will be 2% in 2020 and 1.8% in 2021

.

&gt;Inflation will average 1.5% in 2019. It will rise to 1.9% in 2020 and 2.0% in 2021. (Higher inflation will raise the cost of living. The impact on workers depends on what happens to nominal wages.)



.


&gt;Scientists estimated that, if temperatures only rose 2 C, global gross domestic product would fall 15%. If temperatures rose to 3 C, global GDP would fall 25%. If nothing is done, temperatures will rise by 4 C by 2100. Global GDP would decline by more than 30% from 2010 levels. That's worse than the Great Depression, where global trade fell 25%. The only difference is that it would be permanent.

.

&gt;extreme weather has displaced 22.5 million people according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. By 2050, climate change will force 700 million people to emigrate.

&gt;Machines Will Do Half Our Work By 2025 - Forbes

.

&gt;forecast of 3.5% unemployement in USA to 4.8% 2023-2028(Fed's target is 6.7%)

.

&gt;The unemployment rate in Canada rose to 5.5 percent in June of 2019

.

&gt;U.S. GDP growth will slow to 2.1% in 2019 from 3% in 2018. It will be 2% in 2020 and 1.8% in 2021

.

&gt;Inflation will average 1.5% in 2019. It will rise to 1.9% in 2020 and 2.0% in 2021. (Higher inflation will raise the cost of living. The impact on workers depends on what happens to nominal wages.)



.


&gt;Scientists estimated that, if temperatures only rose 2 C, global gross domestic product would fall 15%. If temperatures rose to 3 C, global GDP would fall 25%. If nothing is done, temperatures will rise by 4 C by 2100. Global GDP would decline by more than 30% from 2010 levels. That's worse than the Great Depression, where global trade fell 25%. The only difference is that it would be permanent.

.

&gt;extreme weather has displaced 22.5 million people according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. By 2050, climate change will force 700 million people to emigrate.

Previously, I would buy stocks on a dip, but never catch the bottom.  Thus, the stocks would drop some more and I would get freaked.  Once the stocks reach break even, I would rush to sell, but then I find that the stocks often breakout to new highs.

What are some techniques you use to buy and hold?  For one, it appears that simply not looking at the market and stock prices so often could help with that, but since those prices are rather ubiquitous, how to avoid looking at them?

Any advice you can give would be much appreciated.

Hi all, 

*I know this might sound dodgey and I’m not going to deny that it does. I really don’t care if you do this or not just making more people aware of this project so they have the option to decide for themselves after doing some research if this is something they wanna be a part of. It is not guaranteed to be a success and it will not lead to overnight value, this is a long term project being developed currently.*

I know this is not stock related as such, but I have stumbled upon a relatively new crypto that poses an interesting investment opportunity that will require ZERO capital and zero cost to you to start investing in.

It is called the Pi Network and is a project by a group of Stanford PhD graduates trying to make a crypto that everyday people can use and start earning.

It is currently in beta stage and has been around for 5 months with a user base of about 200k, you earn an hourly reward of about 0.49/h atm and this reward will halve each time a certain milestone of users is reach (1mil, 10mil and then will stop at 100mil). Getting in now costs you nothing and you will be ahead of the crowd in coins should this take off one day.

The Pi network team is active on the app and twitter and Instagram if you have any questions!

It is a long term prospect so do not expect this to make you rich overnight, just like bitcoin in 2008 this is just the beginning of something that could be huge or could be worthless.

I am not affiliated with the pi network at all, I have only just started myself a few days ago, all you do is download the app, use your phone number or Facebook and you will then need to use an invitation code to get access to the app, mine is “pennychemist” , it may not accept the first time so just click submit again and it will work.

Everyone needs an access code to start generating their first coins so I have provided you with mine should you decide to take a look.

Once you login you will see the a welcome screen and start earning your first pi! If you decide you want out then logout, delete the app and you will never have to see it again.

Once again if you decide to check it out, look up pi network on your App Store; 
my invitation code is pennychemist

CRISPR can be used to change DNA and, in theory, can permanently cure genetic diseases. Animal studies have been promising, and now human trials are underway.

Three publicly traded companies are in the CRISPR business, developing therapies. Some at the trial stage. 

CRSP - Furthest along, trialing drugs for severe sickle cell disease and beta-thallessemia. Results expected early in 2021 ($50.00 per share) (HQ: Sweden)

I have a long-term perspective (investing to grow retirement over next 35-40 years).

Balancing macro-level pros and cons for anyone else perhaps noodling the same idea, proceeds from BRK’s insurance underwriting line have been decreasing. Buffet and Munger are really up there in age. People generally retort with, “Their succession plan is clearly outlined and in good hands,” but Buffet especially and Munger are such key figures that I see a much greater downside psychic risk presented by their passing. However, I also understand BRK’s cash reserves are huge, their balance sheet grows over time, and they may be waiting for the right dip to deploy it all. I also understand BRK commonly operates as a hedge position, since investors tend to pile into it during downturns (and we are due for such a downturn). So it might just be a waiting game to see BRK pop and get some positive movement.

Looking at MSFT, there’s the JEDI contract to be awarded, their dominant position in software, and their second place in cloud with Azure—they appear less exposed to China/trade risks than other names. With V, consumer spending is up as percentage of GDP. AAPL has greater China exposure, but I feel that’s keeping the stock at a good buy-in price right now.

Of course, time horizon here is 35-40 years, so might just be better to stay put and not tinker around so much with positions and just let BRK grow when it’s supposed to.

Would appreciate thoughts from people considering a similar move (and from anyone else who wants to chime in, of course!).",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,387075,public,self,Sell BRK to buy more MSFT/V/AAPL?,0,1565011052,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/clw7b3/sell_brk_to_buy_more_msftvaapl/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

Amazon was down almost 2% yesterday to $1824/share, and 5% down for the week. It's at the lowest point it's been in a month. 

Based on the 3 month resistance trend line, I'm expecting it to fall more to about $1750. I believe this price point to be undervalued, as their logistics operation is unparalleled and their business continues to evolve. Their revenue is up 19% from last quarter, although their net profit margin is down 13%. I believe the latter is because of increasing operation costs due to  implementing increasing delivery services due to FedEx's termination of their contract. 

My plan will be to buy in after a successful break past the $1820 price point (a 3 month resistance area) and sell at a predicted uncertainty area around $2000.

# **Perfect summer storm brewing for stock correction as trade war simmers and more Fed action awaited  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/perfect-storm-building-for-market-correction.html)**
*****
&gt; With new risks from trade wars, stocks head into the final weeks of summer vulnerable to a pull back or even correction.
*****
&gt; The market was down sharply in the past week, buffeted first by disappointment over the Fed’s more hawkish-than-expected policy outlook. Then they were beaten down by fears President Donald Trump is starting a new front in the trade wars with China that is unlikely to end any time soon.
*****
&gt; “The real issue as to why there’s going to be a correction in our view is there’s a massive, massive vacuum here,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG. “In essence, it’s a month and a half of a vacuum, if you think about the direction of the rhetoric. ... The issues are China, the issues are the Fed and the issues are Brexit. In the first tow, you’re almost not going to hear anything.”
*****
&gt; Trump, in threatening new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, said the tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 unless China acts, but no new talks are expected before September. Economists said if the tariffs are put in place, the risks of a U.S. recession rise, particularly if businesses step back from investment, and possibly even hiring. But that could also prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to rescue the economy when it meets in September.
*****
&gt; After a deluge of corporate headlines in the past several weeks, the earnings season is also winding down with just about 60 major companies reporting in the week ahead, and there are no really significant economic reports until the middle of the month.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 could see a decline to about 2,789, though he still expects to see 3,000 at the end of the year. Stocks started the past week near all-time highs, and the S&amp;P 500 was was down more than 3% in the past week, but still up about 17% for the year-to-date. Odds are high that stocks pull back in August, since for the past eight years, the S&amp;P 500 was negative during August in six of them.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said if stocks decline too much or too long, he expects to see some action from the White House that will halt the selling.
*****
&gt; “If you’re the president, there’s no way you’re going to allow an economic slowdown in an election year,” said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics, said Friday the escalation of the trade wars has made him more risk adverse, and he would lighten up holdings in the sectors he had favored—industrials, technology and transportation stocks.
*****
&gt; “We could have a correction ... then we’ll have to see how the policy makers respond to it,′ Knapp said. “The risks are significant. I think we’ll get a correction. ... We could trade back to the May lows, somewhere around 2,750. then we’ll see how the administration responds. This was a seasonally vulnerable period.”
*****
&gt; The Fed cut its target fed funds rate range Wednesday for the first time in a decade, but it does not have another meeting until Sept. 17, though Fed official hold their annual symposium in Jackson Hole at the end of August.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed markets when he said the Fed was in a “midcycle adjustment,” not a longer term rate cutting cycle but by Friday, futures markets were indicating a nearly 100% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September.
*****
&gt; “Clearly from the Fed, you’re going to get silence, until the end of the month in Jackson Hole where you may hear something but nothing of materiality,” said Emanuel. “All the Chinese leadership is by the seaside for the next couple of weeks...what you’re going to get for the next two weeks is next to total silence.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said Brexit is also a risk for markets, as the U.K. gets closer to the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. “In all likelihood, if you hear something between now and then, it’s basically going to increase the perception that brinkmanship toward the Oct. 31 deadline becomes more a reality every day, and this is reflected in the fact the British sterling is collapsing,” he said. The market has been speculating that the odds of a hard Brexit are increasing, meaning Britain leaves the EU with no plan.
*****
&gt; Interest rates and currency wars
&gt; Currency markets were volatile in the past week, but the dollar index was basically flat by Friday afternoon. Traders were monitoring both the moves in the foreign exchange market and fixed income markets.
*****
&gt; As for the bond market, the declines in yields in the past week were dramatic, with about a 30 basis point move in the 10-year yield in just two days. Treasury yields were bouncing along 2016 levels. The 10-year moved from about 2.07% ahead of the Fed news to less than 1.85% It was at 1.87% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, also had moved lower on the Trump trade threats.
*****
&gt; “Now everybody is waiting for the next tweet. Unfortunately, there’s no economics calendar for when those come out,′ said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO.
*****
&gt; Hill said traders will be watching the three auctions, $38 billion in 3-year notes Tuesday; a record $27 billion 10-years Wednesday and the record $19 billion 30-year long bond auction, on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Hill said the market will be watching ISM nonmanufacturing data Tuesday to see if the services side of the economy is still holding up. “It’s been a point of continued strength,” he said, noting at the same time manufacturing has been in decline.
*****
&gt; Knapp said he is also worried that the dollar could strengthen on the trade war, and hurt emerging market currencies and U.S. profits. He noted that the Chinese currency weakened against the dollar overnight.
*****
&gt; He said he is concerned currency volatility could “just start to have this big disruption that could be another factor that would just bleed into risk markets like the equity market.”

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 8/2/19

&gt; Economic data may have taken a bit of a backseat amidst the FOMC meeting Wednesday and tariff headlines at the tail end of the week, but the US still had a heavy slate with 38 total releases.

&gt; Data was broadly weaker with almost twice as many releases coming in weaker (20) than stronger (11) relative to forecasts (or the prior release when there was no consensus forecast). The Dallas Fed kicked off the week with a weaker than expected reading on manufacturing activity, but it was an improvement from June’s level of negative 12.1. In other manufacturing data, on Thursday we got Markit and ISM PMIs which were mixed. While Markit was stronger, the headline reading of ISM was weaker; new orders did improve, however. Headline factory orders were also weaker, but excluding transportation they were unchanged. As forecasted, personal income and spending weakened while inflation came in at a slower than expected pace on Tuesday. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence indices were the main bright spot of the week with stronger readings across the board. Claims data continued to show a slower pace of improvement on Thursday as both initial and continuing claims came in above expectations. Meanwhile, Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report was the most inline with expectations since October 2012, coming in only 1K below forecasts of 165K.

&gt; Economic data is much lighter next week. The non-manufacturing portions of ISM and Markit PMIs are due on Monday. JOLTS and consumer credit are out on Wednesday. Producer inflation gauges are set to be released Friday.

# Fakeouts

&gt; Throughout the course of the entire year, large caps have been leading the market higher, and they are the only market cap range of the equity market to actually make new highs in the most recent leg higher for equities. After this week's pullback, though, the S&amp;P 500 is coming perilously close to breaking through support at the prior highs from April and last fall. A close below those levels today would not be a great mood-setter for the bulls heading into the weekend.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-SPX.png))**

&gt; For Mid and Small Caps, the picture is even less optimistic. The S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap index never came close to a new high in the most recent rally, but it did appear to break its downtrend from the highs late last year. But that breakout quickly turned to a fakeout this week as the S&amp;P 400 broke back down below its prior downtrend line and is breaking below the 50-DMA today.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-MID.png))**

&gt; For the small-cap Russell 2000, it's an identical picture. In this case, the break above the downtrend line was even more short-lived, and like the S&amp;P 400, the Russell 2000 is not only back below its 50-DMA, but it also isn't that far from breaking below its 200-DMA.

# Earnings Season Déjà Vu

&gt; Is it happening again? After what has to this point been a perfectly good earnings season for the US stock market sending the S&amp;P 500 to new all-time highs in the process, the President spoiled the party yesterday when he tweeted that a new round of tariffs would be instituted on Chinese Imports. Stocks had erased all of their declines from Powell's Wednesday press conference by mid-day Thursday, but then the President’s tweet sent equity markets reeling with the Dow falling more than 1%, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell back below 2%.

&gt; If this whole scenario sounds familiar to you, that’s because we saw the same thing last quarter. Remember back in April when the S&amp;P 500 rallied to new highs in the early weeks of earnings season? There was a feeling then that the market was finally breaking out of its rut and on the path to a sustained breakout. But then over the first weekend of May, on a Sunday afternoon no less, the President sent out a series of tweets outlining his plan for increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The following Monday, the market opened lower and kept falling throughout the month. By the end of May, the S&amp;P 500 was down 6.6% for the month, making it the worst May for the S&amp;P 500 since 2010. August has historically been an iffy month for the stock market as many on Wall Street take vacations and try to relax, but if the market follows the earnings season script from last quarter, this will be an August of little rest.

# President Takes Matters into His Own Hands

&gt; The President has been frustrated with the Federal Reserve’s prior rate hikes and now the lack of a more substantial cut in rates. Just the other day, Trump was quoted as saying, “Obama had zero interest rates, we have ‘normalized’ rates. While the Fed hasn’t helped the President’s cause, he has seemingly taken matters into his own hands with his policy towards China. Each time he ratchets up the rhetoric against China, it tends to put additional downward pressure on interest rates, and following Thursday’s tweets, the yield on the 10-year plummetted below 1.9%.

&gt; Ironically enough, the last time the 10-year yield was this low was on Election Day 2016. While short-term borrowing costs are up as the FOMC has hiked rates during Trump's time in office, the yield on the 10-year isn’t much different. Under the eight years of President Obama, the yield on the 10-year averaged 2.47%, while under Trump the average yield has been 2.57%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-10-Year-Yield.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows a shorter-term look at the 10-year yield over the last year and it has practically been in free-fall the entire time. Ever since late 2018, every time the yield has attempted to make a move above its 50-DMA, it has reversed lower, with the most recent leg lower in May coinciding with another series of tweets concerning tariffs on Chinese goods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-10YR-Yield.png))**

&gt; While not a lot of stocks have benefitted from the President’s policy tweets on Chinese tariffs, the impact of lower interest rates has been cheered on by the homebuilders as they have practically been a completely inverse image of the move in rates. Just yesterday, the group hit a new high before pulling back a bit, but lower long-term interest rates mean lower mortgage payments, and that helps to make housing more affordable for millions of millennials looking for a place of their own.

# Outside Day for Gold (GLD)

&gt; Even though assets have been selling off across the board in response to Wednesday's Fed decision and the President's announcement of increased tariffs yesterday, there is one bullish point to be found. Yesterday, gold (GLD) had initially moved slightly lower around the open but then surged into the close, finishing the day only a couple of cents off of the intraday high. Not only did GLD fully recoup the morning's losses, but it also gained back the previous day's losses and then some. This outside day/bullish engulfing pattern is typically seen as a bullish technical signal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GLD.png))**

&gt; This pattern has occurred a total of 35 times in the history of the Gold ETF (GLD). Below we show the 10 previous times that this pattern was observed after not having occurred in the previous six months. Despite being a bullish setup, performance in the next week has actually had a negative bias with an average return of -0.57%. The past five times have seen a loss in the following week. Likewise, three months out sees better than average returns but the probability of GLD trading higher is the just the same as a coinflip. But, generally, in the months and year after, GLD continues to trend higher on average with more consistent gains in the next month, 6 months, and year periods. Returns are also better than normal across these time frames.

# Solid Jobs Growth in July

&gt; The job market continues to be a pillar of strength for the U.S. economy.

&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose 164,000 in July, in line with consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released August 2. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Solid Jobs Growth in July, job creation has slowed slightly this year amid the aging economic expansion, but not to levels that concern us. The 12-month average payrolls gain through July was 187,000, still an above-average pace for the expansion.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NSNykYz.png))**

&gt; Strength in the job market is especially important these days as U.S. consumers increasingly bear the weight of economic growth. Consumer activity added 2.9 percentage points to second quarter gross domestic product (GDP), carrying GDP growth to 2.1%.

&gt; Initial jobless claims, a leading economic indicator, have also pointed to firm labor-market conditions. The four-week average for unemployment claims fell to the fifth-lowest level of the expansion through July 26.

&gt; “We’ve been encouraged by the labor market’s resiliency amid recent global uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “A solid labor market should continue to bolster consumer confidence and buoy economic activity.”

&gt; Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year in July, a faster pace than June’s growth and at a healthy clip for the U.S. consumer. Wages constitute about 70% of business costs, so we’re hoping meaningful pay increases will eventually help lift consumer inflation, countering weakness in global demand. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.7%, still near a cycle low.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&amp;P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

The trade tension between the two nations intensified. The US imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports. On Thursday, President Trump announced a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.

What’s at stake for Boeing?

China’s reaction could impact Boeing (BA). China is Boeing’s largest commercial aircraft market. In 2017, China accounted for approximately 25% of Boeing’s overall commercial aircraft deliveries and 20% of its total orders. However, the company didn’t have any orders from Chinese airline operators in 2018 due to trade relations with the US.

According to Boeing’s estimate, China will need 7,690 new airplanes worth $1.2 trillion over the next 20 years. Also, the company expects that the commercial services industry will grow to $1.5 trillion during the same period and account for 17% of the global demand.

Therefore, China plays a crucial role in Boeing’s sustainable growth in the long term. Over several years, China maintained an even balance for aircraft orders between Boeing and Airbus.

However, China could use Boeing to strike back against the US. In late March, China signed a multi-billion dollar deal with Airbus. The deal was seen as a retaliation against President Trump’s tariff hike on steel and aluminum on March 8. President Jinping signed the agreement during his Paris visit in March. China agreed to purchase 300 Airbus aircraft worth 30 billion euros or $35 billion at the list price.

In early June, Bloomberg reported that Boeing and Chinese officials are negotiating deals for the company’s twin-aisle wide-body jets. However, the deals haven’t materialized. According to the report, the deal could have brought 100 aircraft orders for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and 777X models. The transaction was worth $30 billion at list price.


Boeing’s stock performance

The trade war could create more problems for Boeing. The stock fell over 2% on Thursday due to concerns about risk exposure. The trade war is intensifying between the US and China.

Boeing stock fell over the last four months due to ongoing troubles with its fast-selling 737 MAX planes. Notably, the planes have been under a flying ban since mid-March. There were two deadly accidents within five months. The stock, which made a remarkable run before the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, has lost most of its YTD (year-to-date) gain. As of Thursday, Boeing’s YTD return is 3.7%, which is much lower than nearly 31% as of March 8.

The stock has underperformed the iShares Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (ITA), which has gained 22.7% YTD. ITA invests in companies that assemble, manufacture, and distribute aerospace and defense equipment. Boeing’s peers in the space have also made substantial gains this year. Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and United Technologies (UTX) stocks have returned 40.9%, 38.7%, and 23.8%, respectively.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The agreement foresees the display of ads from Ubex over all Yandex Advertising Network channels.
The agreement signed between Ubex and Yandex, the largest advertising network and equipment supplier in all of Russia and the CIS, marks an important milestone for the Ubex project. The conclusion of the agreement will allow all of Ubex’s clients to display their ads over the Yandex Advertising Network.
In the near future, Ubex clients will have the ability of performing ordering operations inside the Yandex Advertising Network through the Trading Desk.
The Yandex Advertising Network (YAN) is an ad-serving platform that consists of websites, mobile apps, Smart TV apps, and videos. Ads from Yandex.Direct are served in ad blocks on these platforms.

Only quality web resources with high traffic can join the Yandex Advertising Network. Each resource that requests to join the Yandex Advertising Network must pass a multi-step moderation to ensure it complies with the Terms of Participation. Yandex does not allow web resources to join the Advertising Network if they publish low-quality content or were created solely to make money through ad placement.
Currently, the YAN audience comprises tens of millions of users and a large percent of them don not overlap with Yandex search users. Therefore, placing an ad on YAN websites will allow expanding audience coverage.
The Ubex project continues to develop as it signs more agreements with leading advertising networks and platforms to ensure greater coverage for its clients. We have signed eight more partnership agreements with different SSPs. We will be ready to share details next week. Stay tuned for more news and updates from Ubex.

                                          Partnerships with SSPs

The Ubex project has successfully concluded 10 agreements with Supply Side Platforms for the provision of traffic volumes in various regions around the world.
After the successful conclusion of an agreement with the Yandex Advertising Service, Ubex has concluded 10 more agreements with key SSPs to ensure large traffic volumes for users of the platform. The SSP platforms operate in every key region of the world and will provide the Ubex platform with full coverage of millions of users.
Though Ubex cannot yet disclose the names of its partners due to agreement confidentiality clauses, the following are the volumes in displays that the new partners will be able to generate in various global regions:
Korea only — 70 Million / daily
China — 1.1 Billion / daily
Russia and the CIS — 986 Million / daily
North America — 1.355 Billion / daily
European Economic Area (EEA) — 202 Million / daily + 150k QPS (queries per second)
Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA) — 25k QPS
South East Asia (SEA+APAC) — 220 Million /daily + 105 QPS (APAC)

The conclusion of the agreements will ensure that the Ubex platform will have outstanding traffic volumes and will be able to ensure that all of its users will have global coverage in ad placement.
The Ubex project is currently conducting technical integration of the SSPs with which the agreements have been conclude. The integration period can take up to a month or a month a half to ensure successful operation. Once the SSPs have been fully connected, Ubex will be able to make use of the full range of network services of the SSPs. The names of the newly added SSPs will be disclosed in due time once technical integration has been successfully completed and the partners are providing quality traffic channels within the stated volumes.

So once you buy a call option, and let’s say it goes well for you and the share price jumps up and you make money. 

How do you actually make money? Are you supposed to “exercise” the option and buy the x100 shares and then immediately sell the shares for profit? Or are you supposed to sell the option itself for the profit?

Also, let’s say the share is not moving much but it barely hits the price point where you’re hitting profit for a few minutes, then falls back down.

I am not looking for someone to do the work for me, but I'm at a total loss and need some guidance.

I've looked at historical's, market competition, market size, risks, limitations, what's in the future, and no matter how I capture any amount of data, it's constantly being thrown back to me that I am not providing enough data to say if the stock is over or under valued.  I ask, ""What can I provide?"", to which i receive a response of, ""The REAL WORLD won't tell you, you have to figure it out!"".  

I've googled my eyeballs out, I've calculated EV/EBITDA, I've calculated sharp ratios, standard deviations, portfolio betas, I've read through the 10k's, 10Q's, all of that.... you name it.

What am I not doing?  What are some methods you all use to determine if a stock is over/under valued?  I just need a strategy, and I can research it on my own and figure out how to implement it, but I have no idea what else to do.

Anything you can throw at me I'll do the legwork and would be greatly appreciated.  I am not into stocks, I'm a data analyst so I'm used to working with historicals and not assumptions.  I hope someone can provide me anything so I can lose more sleep researching for the next week.

Ok, I get it. Two shares at $50 has the same value as one share at $100. But unless I’m missing something (I’m a beginner so bear with me) wouldn’t the fact that you have more shares be a clear an obvious advantage?

My single $100 share goes up by $1. Now I have $101.
My two $50 shares go up by $1. Now I have $102.

I have a close friend who owns this stock in his retirement account, having done work for the company himself. 

I still like their products and the sector, although I do think there are too many software companies than what the market will be able to sustain long term. PTC seems to be diversified though and calling it just another software company is inadequate, but Without owning the products yourself, it is hard as an investor to gauge which of these companies/products is superior to others. 

PTC’s industrial augmented reality product is what I am most interested in for the company. I have seen it myself and believe the potential is massive, any industrial/factory business would find it helpful to have instructions, statistics, updates projected in one’s field of vision. They are pushing their augmented reality software into other sectors of the economy as well, like retail, and defense to prove new applications for their software. 

CREO is their CAD software package, but I have never used it before and i know there are competitors in the industry, as I have used other 3D design programs. 

There is an industrial IOT product they make, but it seems like IOT is something any software company does these days, so I don’t know what to make of it. 

From a numbers standpoint, the year over year revenues aren’t great, despite heavy amounts of spending. Their balance sheet could be better but it isn’t as bad as many other high flying growth stocks.

But SLS is the one I have had an eye on, so I will use it as the example to hopefully learn a thing or 2 from some of you more seasoned investors in the biotech space.

They basically have nothing more than a promising pipeline at this point.  Their reports show success in their clinical trials so far for the treatments they have been working on.  And they are due to report results from a Phase 2 clinical trial ""any day now"", after a QC update was released a few weeks ago.

The stock has been beat down (~ -97%) in the last year.  The speculation is that a short squeeze will happen when this P2 report comes out, IF it is positive.

Even then, the company will still have several Phase 3 trials to complete, and capital to raise for those trials, before they can market these treatments.  So they will still be profitless, if I am understanding this all correctly.

My direct question is, what has historically happened with companies that release positive results but still have nothing in the market to profit from?  After the shorts close their positions to stop the bleeding (if speculation ends up turning to reality), does the stock continue to rise or flatten on the good news alone?  Or do they usually drop back down until the company starts generating real profit?

I know there are a lot of dark clouds around SLS in particular, and the general risk of speculative investing.  This isn't a ""make me feel better about my investment"" post.  As mentioned above, just using them as the example bc it is the first biotech I have really looked into.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,384441,public,self,[Discussion] $SLS,0,1564598414,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cjw20a/discussion_sls/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&amp;#x200B;

Before their most recent earnings release there was a headline about the total financial hit that grounding the 737 would bring, and it was a number around $5billion. (I don't remember the exact date/time of this release). However, despite this news, BA rose \~4% the next trading day, reaching around 378$ a share. Over the next couple of days, the stock ended up reaching the high 380s, and then the earnings report came.

&amp;#x200B;

Since plummeting, BA sits at about 340 a share as I type this. Even though the company took a $5bil price hit, they exceeded the expected earnings with a \~51% surprise. Despite out earning exprectations, the stock fell.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal experience would lead me to conclude that BA is in a short dip, and will continue to rise, given how they outperformed earnings expectations by a great deal, but then again, I could be wrong.

I am a relatively new investors who is currently only familiar with mutual funds, index fund, and ETFs. I have kind of a basic question that I might not like the answer to. 

Vanguard’s site says that I will be charged something like $7.25 per trade for the first 25 trades and $20 per trade thereafter. If I were to purchase 10 shares of a company versus 100 shares of a company in one trade will I be charged the same trade fee? If so it is obvious that a higher dollar amount in a trade means better value for the fee. Is this the basic gist of a trade fee or is there something I am missing?

I would use Robinhood, but I wanted to buy the shares for my Roth which is only at 40% contribution for the year (I am an intern, you see).  If there is anything else that anyone thinks I should know I am eager to learn. Is Vanguard the right choice because that’s where my Roth IRA is? Is Robinhood better because of 0 fees? Should I do both?

Thanks!


P.S. for anyone wondering the ticker I have been watching is ZEUS (Olympic Steel). I think they may have either had a split within the last couple years or had large shareholders sell out. I work within the company and would like to claim my stake. It appears the the low $12/high $11 has been somewhat of a price floor/support. Anybody with an opinion on ZEUS?

I’m a longtime lurker and this is my first post. Bear with me ;).\n\nHistory: I put $25 calls on BYND pre-IPO and missed when it opened at $40. Stock has been an absolute monster ever since. I flirted with the idea of selling $100 calls when the options market opened. Would’ve lost crazy money. Here are my takeaways:\n\nWhy I think it’s a good stock: \n\n1. Innovation: it’s a innovative product. Too much of today’s market is lacking real innovation. Unlike TLRY, a plant-protein meat alternative just didn’t exist. There was no commercial market. Simply put, people haven’t eaten this shit before. Best competitive moat is something completely new. I think it’s safe to say this is 10x better than any vegan alternative. Here’s a good sign: When other companies are marketing your product to their existing customers (see dunkin) you’ve created something very valuable.\n\n2. Management is solid: Look up the origin story- smart guys. Inventors. Seems like a good team. Managing the post-IPO PR well. \n\n3. Market share growth: these massive partnerships they’re securing are expensive but crucial for distribution. And BYND’s biz dev team is crushing go-to-market strategy. Broad distribution, great marketing/hype, well timed into existing health trends. They’re doing the right things.\n\nOk, so you’ve explained the buy above. But at these levels, this has to go down. Come on, 600%? Bro I’m going to short...\n\nMaybe not. Here’s why:\n\n1. Betting on innovation pays off: This company has extremely high long term growth prospects. For investors looking for protected returns years into the future, BYND represents an extremely disruptive play into an entrenched industry. For Joe Shmoe, this might not make any sense. It’s too overvalued, right? Wrong. Other investors are just playing a different game. These people are bidding up the opportunity to gamble on an innovator. I mean gambling, that’s all we are doing right? \n\n2. Momentum. Here’s a quick rule: The larger the upround, the more undervalued the stock. Here’s a quick story, but there are countless examples of this playing out in business: Facebooks seed round was 5 million valuation. 8 months later, it raised money at 80 million valuation. 15x in 8 months! 6 months later, that April, they were valued at 585 million. Another 5x! Do you sell? By September, an offer for $1billion from Yahoo!. A yeah later, $15 billion valuation from Microsoft. What’s the takeaway here? when you have momentum, the steeper the valuation, the more undervalued the company. There are differences between the public and private markets, and I’m not claiming BYND is anything close to Facebook, but the general rule is to not short the winning horse. For large players, they’re hunting for monsters that can move the needle. \n\nTakeaway: think twice before thinking of jumping into this game against this kind of momentum. The numbers are only part of the story and I anticipate a high chance of getting burned short.\n\nDisclaimer: don’t own any stock. Would buy if it goes down. Overvalued for us.

So I was trying to wrap my head around the logistics of short selling, and came up with an analogy that helps me understand the goal of selling short in a simple way, likening it to how a car dealership will buy back used vehicles. The only difference being, when you sell short, you aren't the one who actually owns the shares. For this to work, imagine it's a car dealership that just stores new cars in a lot for a much larger company, and they don't own the cars themselves:

&amp;#x200B;

1) They sell you one of the new, undriven cars in their lot for 20k

2) As soon as you drive it off the lot, the car loses value (imagine if in every short trade you made, the price immediately went down by \~10%)

3) In 5 years, you decide you want to upgrade vehicles, and go back to the same dealer to sell them back the car

4) The dealer pays you 8k for the car. This means they just made 12k, and they also have the car back in their lot, albeit at a reduced value. They never owned the car, but were able to profit on the decrease in value (let's also pretend the company that asked them to store the cars doesn't care if people drove them).

This is really a risk-free trade with a chance to earn up to $250. But in order to get the money, you do need to create a Tastyworks account, which requires a $2k deposit. Only US residents can claim the credit unfortunately. Also, you can only long or short stocks/ETFs for the challenge (no options).

I have a Tastyworks account that I use for trading options, they have one of the lowest costs I know ($1 per contract to open, max $10 per leg) and they don’t charge anything to close your positions. You can see their pricing structure here - [http://bit.ly/32RvEWd](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/%22). As you know, commissions can play a huge role in your trade profitability, so the lower the better.

If you do open a Tastyworks account, I will be VERY GRATEFUL if you use this Tastyworks affiliate link to open an account! - [http://bit.ly/2GxAiiy](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/%22). Tastyworks will issue me some credits for the referral (so I can grow my 9k account to something more respectable). Thank you!!

All the best and happy trading everyone!

I’m looking for an ETF in international markets for a longterm position. Preferably the bulk of country diversification would be Europe (30-40%) and PacAsia (20-35%). 

Everything I’m looking at though seems to be priced pretty flat over 3-5 years historical, but offers 2-3.5% dividends. 

Whereas individual stocks tend to seek steady growth over longterm, international market ETFs don’t appear to do the same (or at least some of the top funds). 

Have I been looking at these the wrong way? Are these ETFs more of a ‘hold and reinvest dividends’ strategy rather than a ‘6-8% yearly over the next decade or two’ strategy?

Or am I misunderstanding all together?

I'm fairly new. I've been reading general articles and blogs etc. Regarding investing. 
I hold a steady job, with a monthly income. I'm not making a killing, but enough to have spare money. 
I'm currently saving up cash for unexpected things(car repair, dentist bill, etc) and at the same time i have about 150-250 dollars a month to invest. 

I researched and decided on primarily index funds. 
I invested my 175 dollars in an index fund a month ago, and so far so good. 
I'm keeping track of the fund daily, but it havent reached a point where I was scared or considered getting out, despite ups and downs. 

So far, so good. Now in the coming week, i'll invest more. I've considered getting into Disney, Microsoft and AMD as stand alone stocks. 

My question is for a long term strategy, with a monthly investment do I get in deeper with the same fund? Spread out into other funds, or go for one stock? And in the long run, with a total of 12 yearly investments, what is the natural plan forward? 

I'm going for low maintenance, buy and hold for 10-15 years and long term 30 years. 

Any advice is appriciated. 

Also english is my secondary language, i'm trading from Denmark.

I would assume that it meant stockholders would be entitled to a percentage of the company's profits relative to the volume of stocks they own in the company, paid out in dividends. For instance, owning 500 out of the 1000 total stock volume in a company gets you 50% of the profit.

# **The Fed is about to cut rates to protect the economy, even though most signs are strong  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/fed-to-cut-rates-for-first-time-since-2008-jobs-data-should-be-strong.htmll)**
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade Wednesday, a pre-emptive move as concerns rise about the impact of the trade wars and a slowing global economy.
*****
&gt; Friday’s July jobs report should show that the U.S. economy is still strong, with 170,000 nonfarm payrolls being added and an extremely low unemployment rate of 3.7%, according to Refinitiv. That follows this past Friday’s report of second -quarter GDP, which grew at a better than expected 2.1% but showed clear signs of impact from tariffs and trade friction.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new highs, as investors anticipated a Fed rate cut, and also a better-than-expected earnings season. Earnings growth is slightly positive so far this quarter, but that could improve with another big wave of earnings in the week ahead, when nearly a third of the S&amp;P 500 report.
*****
&gt; Apple, Exxon Mobil, Procter and Gamble, Merck, General Motors and Verizonare among companies reporting. Beyond Meat, the hot IPO with a market cap bigger than a quarter of companies in the S&amp;P 500, reports Monday. Seventy-five percent of companies have beaten estimates so far and 60% beat revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; It will be the Fed though that will likely have the most market impact, and strategists are looking for the central bank to signal it is open to future cuts but not necessarily promising them. Economists mostly expect anywhere from one to three rate cuts this year, but there is near consensus that this first cut will be a quarter percentage point.
*****
&gt; “The market is pricing in a 25 basis point cut,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist with Prudential Financial. “We already know of two Fed presidents who don’t think we need it, so there’s obviously going to be a discussion, with the strong data. The chairman, who is in the camp that we need to have an insurance cut, is going to make the case that while the economic data are all gaining strength, they are still worried about weakening conditions, due to uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs.”
*****
&gt; The strains of the trade war and tariffs showed up in a reduction in gross private domestic investment in second quarter GDP of 5.5%, the worst decline in that category since 2015. Within that, exports fell 5.2%. The decline in business investment wiped a full percentage point from the final GDP number.
*****
&gt; The Fed has boxed itself into moving rates, says JP Morgan US chief eocnomist
*****
&gt; In the last several weeks, as the Fed meeting edged closer, economic data began to show signs of improvement from a soft patch this winter and spring. Consumers, who comprise 70% of the economy, strengthened in the second quarter, with consumption up 4.3%, its best reading since the fourth quarter of 2017.
*****
&gt; The Fed “will signal they’re’ going to go on if conditions warrant it. It’s clear the chairman and his cohorts are not looking at incoming data in the sense that they are data dependent. They made it clear they want to inoculate the economy,” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint, said he expects the Fed to cut rates just once and then stop.
*****
&gt; “They’re not going to say that we’re done. I think it would be too much of a leap for the market. My sense is they’ll leave the door open, but their aim is not going to be locked in for the next meeting. It’s clearly a function of how the data play out,” Stanley said. “I’m just more optimistic than they are about the how things are going to evolve.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching for headlines on trade in the coming week, as the U.S. delegation returns to China for the first round of face to face talks since May.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 7/26/19

&gt; The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index kicked off this week's busy macroeconomic data slate on a disappointing note with a still negative reading that was below forecasts. Weak data continued to come in on Tuesday with FHFA home price growth slowing to 0.1% and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index reaching a multi-year low. Existing Home Sales also came in weaker. Preliminary Markit PMIs released on Wednesday came in below estimates and weaker than the previous month while the services portion saw the opposite results. The release of preliminary Durable Goods and Capital Goods on Thursday came in much stronger than both expectations and the May release. Meanwhile, weekly labor data once again came in at a multi-month low. We ended the week with stronger than expected GDP data, but it still showed the economy slowed versus the first quarter. Overall, economic data didn't have the greatest of weeks with over half of the indicators released weakening or coming in below estimates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco1.png))**

&gt; Next week is a busy one when it comes to macroeconomic developments. The week starts off quiet with only the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity Index out on Monday. It is expected to rebound to -5 off its multiyear low of -12.1 from its June release. Things pick up on Tuesday with the release of personal income and spending data which are forecast to fall 0.1%. PCE data, Pending Home Sales, and consumer confidence will also be out that day. Ahead of Friday's Nonfarm Payrolls report, which is expected to show 170K added jobs in July, on Wednesday ADP will release their own employment data. Also on Wednesday, there will be an FOMC rate decision followed by a presser by Fed Chair Powell. Markets are anticipating a 25 bps cut in this meeting. After digesting the results of this meeting, on Thursday ISM will release their manufacturing report for July. In addition to the NFP report, the release of the June trade balance, factory orders, and the University of Michigan's sentiment data will all round out the week on Friday.

# The Bespoke Report -- Global Macro Outlook

&gt; This week we're outlining how we see the global economy at present, along with its influence on US interest rates, credit, commodities, and equity markets. One of the topics we discuss in detail is the strong performance of US GDP in Q2, which in addition to upward revisions from 2014-2018 also showed newly-reported Q2 growth that was far stronger than analyst estimates. Smaller-than-expected headwinds from trade and inventory and a massive surge in consumer spending helped push growth above expectations despite weak investment. With the Fed set to join the global central bank easing party at its July meeting, it's part of the reason to expect that the global backdrop is set to improve.

# Financials Appear Poised For a Strong Second Half

&gt; After a disappointing start to the year, financials were the top performing sector in the second quarter.

And technical analysis suggests they may have more room to run.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2Fva1zL.png))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Financials Outperformance May Mark a Change in Trend, the relative performance of financials versus the S&amp;P 500 Index has broken a downtrend, which we see as a bullish technical signal. This tells us the technicals may now be aligning with our optimistic fundamental outlook for financials, which we highlighted in our Midyear Outlook 2019.

&gt; Financials’ strong performance has continued a few weeks into July, with the S&amp;P 500 Financials Index and KBW Bank Index both outpacing the market thus far. Defensive areas of the market, including the utilities, real estate, and healthcare sectors, have all lagged the S&amp;P 500 since the end of the first quarter. We think cyclicals’ outperformance could continue if economic fundamentals improve.

&gt; “The rotation from defensive stocks, which have led for much of the past year, to more cyclical areas of the market, is not only healthy for the bull market, but should favor active managers who can overweight these sectors,” according to LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.

&gt; While we don’t anticipate broad market performance to be as strong in the second half of 2019, we believe that an overweight to financial stocks may offer an opportunity for suitable investors based on attractive valuations, a potentially steeper yield curve, and an improving technical picture.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&amp;P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

*****

# Second-Half Pre-Election Year Blues Absent…So Far

&gt; A little over one week ago, we posted updated charts of historical pre-election year performance with 2019 overlaid for comparison. Like then DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are still comfortably above average for this time of a pre-election year when compared to historical data. Thus far earnings have supported a continuation of the rally. A 100% probability (according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool as of today) that the Fed will cut rates at least 0.25% is also aiding. And now it appears the debt ceiling is going to be raised eliminating another market headwind. 

It would seem the market has nearly everything going its way. Almost, sentiment is running on the frothy side. According to Investors Intelligence, bullish advisors have reached 58%, a new high for 2019, while bearish advisors are down to just 16.8%. Historically these levels have been an early warning. Combined with the historically meager gains in the second half of pre-election years (visible in the charts below), the rally appears to be increasingly prone to faltering. If the market does take a pause and consolidate some of its gains so far this year in August/September/early-October, it would likely improve the possibility of a respectable fourth quarter rally.

Our first impression is usually right, and this, along with many other things, becomes glaringly apparent in the stock market. Just like in life, if you overthink, your result is usually worse, not better.

Trump constantly applies this logic. Many have called him a simpleton (among many other things — some of it true) but he didn’t get to the position he is in today by being stupid.

“I try to step back and remember my first shallow reaction. The day I realized it can be smart to be shallow was, for me, a deep experience.” 

He went Wharton, one of the top business schools in the world, and was coached from an early age by his father, a multi millionaire New York real estate magnet, so when he talks like a simpleton, he is probably doing it on purpose.

When faced with a complicated situation, simplification, and using common sense, is usually the best approach, and this is especially true in the world of construction. In most cases, the more complicated your plan of action, the more likely that something will go wrong.

*Important things to note:*

* I am going to draw comparisons between Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. These companies are the major stakeholders within the chip industry; but, they produce different types of products. Nvidia and AMD produce dedicated Graphics cards. Intel on the other hand, does not. Intel and AMD produce CPUs. Intel's success in the graphic's industry comes from their integrated graphics (much less computation power) within their CPU chips.
* I used Bloomberg as my reference for all numbers within the quantitative portion of the fundamental analysis.

**Qualitative** Fundamental Analysis:

* What does Nvidia provide to consumers?
   * Nvidia is the current global leader in the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) market. Things like bitcoin/blockchain technologies, esports, and overall computational demands require the use of GPUs.
   * High Performance Computing: Scientific modeling in industry, research, and higher education rely on the use of GPUs. The intense computations required to model a tsunami in Japan, or an ecosystem in the Amazon use GPU multi-threading (faster code) to speed up the process.
   * As we all know, 'Artificial Intelligence' is the new buzz. Stances on whether or not it will/should boom is highly objective. Nevertheless, Nvidia is a global leader in Research and Development (R&amp;D) for AI. Nvidia's AI is being used to:
      * Produce autonomous cars. The image processing for these self-driving cars rely on both the computational workhorse GPU and the skills of AI. Nvidia recently agreed to partner with Mercedes-Benz to help produce their vehicles.
      * Analyze medical images. The AI is being developed to reconize illnesses and injuries within medical image scans like CTs, X-Rays, or MRIs. As a bonus, the modern versions of those previously mentioned imaging machines use GPUs.
      * Route network traffic. Nvidia is looking to make IP tables, switching fabric, etc., a thing of the past (these are some of the backbones of the internet). The company is looking to implement these types of solutions into a more software-based layer, powered by AI.
* Who are Nvidia's competitors? What kind of economic moat does the company have?
   * The largest competitors are Intel and AMD; but, Intel does not currently produce dedicated graphics cards. AMD graphics cards are on the rise, but they are nowhere near the quality of product given by Nvidia. Nvidia does hold an essential monopoly (\~97% market share) of data center GPU computing within the Fortune 100 companies. It will not be too easy to replace the company. They develop the best products and have an astronomical R&amp;D budget to continuously improve them.
* How successful is management?
   * The 'newest' executive is the CFO, who was hired on in 2013. Other execs have been around the company for many years. This could indicate a satisfaction within the workplace and overall happiness within the company
   * Jensen Huang (Founder &amp; CEO) - The CEO made the Harvard Business Review's list of top CEOs in 2018 - Huang was the second best. According to an (alleged, I have no way to verify) employee on Glassdoor, Huang is one of the hardest workers in the company, stating: ""As long as Huang is healthy, Nvidia will fly high."" However, the account follows that by knocking the work ethic of other management leaders within the company.
      * Jensen Huang is not exactly a household name. Is he famous? Yes. But, he does not attract the mass media attention like a Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. Rather, he keeps his head down and works to lead the company.
   * According to employees (again, allegedly), Huang gives all employees an equal chance to succeed. The paper qualifications that one may have hold little value to Huang; he is more interested in one's ideas.
* What are the Negatives?
   * Nvidia creates GPUs, so if CPU computation power continuously increases like Moore’s Law predicts, users might not need a dedicated Graphics Card. Intel, producing integrated graphics within their dies/chips, could overtake the need for a dedicated unit.
      * Mitigation: A GPU can only enhance a computation experience. There will always be a market that desires the fastest compilation technology.

**Quantitative** Fundamental Analysis:

* The Balance Sheet:
   * Nvidia has been consistently lowering it's debt-to-asset ratio over the last few years. The company has the lowest D/A ratio, at 14.96%, when compared to AMD (27.44%) and Intel (20.60%).
   * Company assets, at $127.963 Million, exceed their liabilities, at $52,981 Million. AMD, the only other dedicated GPU producer at the moment, has a much more narrow difference between their assets and liabilities.
* The Income Statement:
   * Nvidia's net income was $4,141 Million in 2018. AMD's was $337 Million. Now, Nvidia is pulling that kind of revenue from their GPU market, primarily. AMD uses its increasing trend in CPU market share over Intel to create its lower net income.
   * Earnings-per-Share (EPS) - Nvidia's EPS is much higher than it's main competitor, AMD. Nvidia boasts a $4.77 EPS, while AMD, produces a $0.36 EPS. Intel, is also slightly lower at $4.36; but, Intel shares are a third of the price of an Nvidia share, so this number is actually larger.
   * Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio - Nvidia holds a 36.35 P/E ratio; AMD holds a 131.44; and Intel holds a 11.95. Intel has been around since 1968, so this could account for their much lower P/E ratio, since they are a more developed company. AMD's P/E ratio, at \~4x that of Nvidia's, could be attributed to its up-and-coming CPU products. AMD Ryzen processors are really starting to rival Intel's 'i' series in terms of market share.
* The Cash Flow:
   * Nvidia does have negative annual cash flow. This is due to their large sums investments, which could increase in value, so this could be a benefit to the company. Or, their investments could fail, and this would damage the company. If looking at Revenue and Financing cash flow though, Nvidia is in the positive.
* Price-to-Book (P/B) Value:
   * Nvidia's P/B value is at \~11, while AMD's is \~21. Intel has a much lower value though, at \~3. Again though, Nvidia produces a different type of product and sells to a different market than Intel does.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.
