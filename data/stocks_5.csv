They cite the same issues related to the 737s. My question is, don't the expectations for the next ER already price in the 737 issues? We can fairly well estimate how much revenue and profit was lost due to the 737s, the backlog, the slowing production, the compensation payouts to airlines, and the expenses related to preparation for further payouts and litigation. Isn't the expectation now for the next ER already that Boeing will be down significantly compared to last year? None of this is news. Assuming the ER is closely aligned with these expectations, why would the price drop upon the ER release confirming such? Sometimes individual investors panic when seeing what they already knew to be true generally printed in the ER, but this would be brief at most, and institutions probably wouldn't be phased.

&amp;#x200B;

We know the ER will be pretty bad generally, but it'll likely match expectations. I think there's little reason to think the expectations will be off. If they are, they could just easily go the other way - that is, maybe the ER isn't quite as bad as we anticipate, in which case the price might even rise.

I have personally been to cell phone towers participating in the build out. I do think at this moment Dish has pulled back a little bit on the build out compared to last year waiting to see how the T-Mobile Sprint merger goes, as Dish is set to acquire Boost mobile along with more spectrum and become the 4th mobile provider, but I do believe that they are waiting to officially acquire the new spectrum before they continue any more build out along. Dish is in a unique position of all the carriers by not having an existing network in place, they can go all in on 5g and do not have to divide their spectrum covering older 4g, 3g, and 2g devices.

I am reading a lot of mixed reports of the T-Mobile Sprint merger though. Some say it looks like it will likely go through, while other reports say it is 50/50. I personally think it will go through. Dish's internal communication throughout the company and the fulfillment partners seems to be very positive for the future. I also think Dish's stock isn't reflective of all of the current projects that they have going on. Last quarter was the first subscriber gain in years and the stock didn't move like I thought it would. On top of the subscriber gain, Dish has officially partnered with Google, building the Google Assistant into our remotes and UI of the Hopper set top box and even allowing integration of Nest into the Hopper such as setting the Nest thermostat from the voice remote, or when the Nest Hello Doorbell is rang it shows up as a notification on the screen of the Hopper. Dish has also began shifting focus of the technician job position from being just a satellite technician to being an all around electronic technician with partnerships with Samsung (doing fulfillment work such as repairing appliances), Amazon (doing basic A/V work like hanging tvs and setting up soundbars etc purchased thru Amazon, along with Ring product installs), and as mentioned above, Google (all techs are official Nest Pro installers, and offer Nest products to every customer). 

Through these partnerships Dish has spun off another brand that started in November, OnTech, where the technicians do fulfillment work for pretty much any company that wants a skilled technician that is part of a JD Power customer service award company to do their labor. Most of the partnerships above have been branded as OnTech going forward, and they are actively pursuing all sorts of other partnerships for fulfillment work going forward, with a road map for this year that includes adding more partners that need technicians for tech product installs such as big box stores like Lowes, Bed Bath and Beyond, and even insurance and mortgage companies looking to offer smart home devices and security systems to lower their risks such as Quicken Loans. Customers can also go directly to OnTechs site and purchase products from select partners and schedule appointments. I haven't found too much press on this venture for Dish and think it isn't being reflected in the stock prices. We have heard there will be a big advertisement push in the Spring to increase awareness for this, but this brand is live now. 

Sprint looks like a good buy to me, as under the terms of the merger, Sprint shareholders would receive 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile for every share of Sprint. With T-Mobile currently trading at about $78, that implies a merger price of $8 for Sprint. But Sprint is trading at $5.18, a 35% discount to the implied merger price if the deal is approved. 

I am kind of new to stocks and would like some opinions on this. I currently have a little invested in Dish because I do believe they are trying to adapt to the streaming TV landscape and are planning on dominating the DIFY (do it for you) landscape. 

My questions are: 

Do you guys think the T-Mobile Sprint merger will pass? And do you anticipate the ruling to go quickly or be drawn out in the courts?

Do you feel like Dish's stock is currently not pricing in their other ventures and partnerships as they transition from being a satellite/cable provider into more of a tech labor force and 5g provider? Also, assuming the merger goes thru, will the Boost acquisition and additional spectrum drive Dish's stock up alot?

Is Sprint a good buy considering there it is a 35% discount to the merger price?

Brief background: Google agreed to acquire Fitbit on Nov 1 for $7.35/share. $FIT spiked to $7.20 and has bled to $6.44 since the announcement on the back of a supposed investigation by the DOJ ([more on that here](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21009870/justice-department-doj-google-fitbit-acquisition-antitrust-review-data-privacy-ftc)

I’m no lawyer, but there are likely no antitrust issues here - $FIT is a pimple on GOOGL’s balance sheet, and has only 4% share of the wearables market. The issues are around privacy concerns - how is Google going to use the data? Google already has a partnership with Fitbit with its health analytics , and Fitbit partners with Google Cloud to house its data. 

So, why wouldn’t a simple opt in/opt out alleviate these privacy concerns (like GDPR) and collapse the spread, causing the stock to rise closer to $7.35? 

The background on the merger is worth a read [Fitbit merger proxy ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1447599/000162828019015006/fitbitdefinitiveproxy.htm). Google and Fitbit will exercise their best efforts to get the deal done, and there was a very active second bidder here (rumoured to be Facebook, which would arguably face the same scrutiny). 

Google was also Investigated for its recent acquisition of Looker , and that was approved a few months after (frankly, any mega tech/internet mergers will be investigated in detail). Perhaps this one is no different ?

That sent Chinese stocks, along with US companies that import and use Chinese products, higher on Thursday. Then on Friday, oil and defense stocks, along with gold, received a boost (for the want of a better word) from the US airstrike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani. Airline stocks fell as oil reached a seven month high.

In Japan, Carlos Ghosn, the 5 foot 6 inch ex CEO of Renault and Nissan who was facing charges of financial misconduct charges, provided a great story that seems more appropriate for Hollywood than Wall Street. Despite being held under strict bail conditions including constant surveillance, Mr Ghosn apparently climbed into a case for musical instruments on Sunday evening before being whisked off to a local Japanese airport and flown to Turkey and then on to the Lebanon.

Back home, Barron’s ran a worrying story about **Canada Goose’s** ($GOOS) $1,000 signature parkas and how they are stuffed with goose down and trimmed with coyote fur. That’s a dangerous product to be associated with in the age of the anti-fur movement and social media. The Daily Beast has already run a story claiming that owning a Canada Goose parka may even put off potential dating partners. Canada Goose’s stock price has fallen 50% from 2018 highs and its valuation at 35x earnings would normally be reasonable for a company growing at around 30% p.a. However the risk of being outed for the use of fur in the fickle fashion industry means I would avoid.

**Cassave Science Inc’s** ($SAVA) stock price almost doubled after CEO Remi Barbier bought 100,000 of stock on New Years eve. The purchase follows positive data from a mid stage trial for one of its experimental Alzheimer’s disease drugs. There is still a way to go before approval, meaning the stock may yet have to give up all the recent gains (and more), but with a market cap of just $166 million the potential upside from an approved Alzheimer’s drug would be huge. The purchase by the CEO is a big vote of confidence from those in the know and sends out a strong signal to the market.

On Monday, **Sol-Gel** ($SLGL) jumped 90% after reporting positive phase 3 trial results for its acne treatment drug Twyneo. Sol-Gel now plans to file a new drug application (NDA) in the second half of 2020. It is more good news for the company which was already planning to file an NDA for its rosacea drug Epsolay and potentially going from zero to two commercial stage drugs in one year. The company’s valuation has jumped to $320 million, but that looks reasonable given its two drugs that are close to approval with a combined total addressable market of $10 billion.

Otherwise the news was largely confined to analyst upgrades and downgrades. A couple that caught my eye were Goodyear Tire and Axsome Therapeutics.

**Goodyear Tire** ($GT) is a cyclical stock that will never trade at a premium but with the stock down 55% over the past two years and trading on 7x 2020 consensus earnings its valuation is looking cheap. Nomura Instinet analyst Anindya Das agrees with a target price 33% above Fridays close. Das says GT has a strong earnings outlook having largely completed its restructuring. I would agree, auto sales have slumped since 2015 but, with the average auto age at an all time high of 12 years (and in the absence of a recession), it’s likely that the renewal cycle will begin in the near term. GT’s forward PE looks cheap compared to peers such as Cooper Tires (10x 2020 earnings). The 4.2% dividend also looks attractive.

**Axsome's** ($AXSM) was up on Monday after reporting positive results from a late-stage study to evaluate, AXS-07, its drug for the acute treatment of migraine. Good news for Axsome and 37 million Americans suffer from migraine. Axsome said it plans to file an NDA in the second half of 2020.

It follows news earlier in December regarding Axsome’s new clinical drug the blockbuster, AXS-05, which reported significant improvements in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). 47% of patients with MDD achieve complete remission, as opposed to the 16% of patients taking the placebo. Depression treatments are one of the largest healthcare markets in the U.S., with around 7.1% of adults -- or 17.3 million -- Americans affected each year. Estimated at USD 15.60 Billion in 2018. And there's not a lot of competition.

Axsome's stock has surged by almost 4,000% since the beginning of 2019, pushing the stock from a $93 million market cap into the $3.5 billion range. But it could have further upside potential due to AXS-05 and AXS-05 and the large addressable market. Priced at $95.20 at Fridays close Cantor Fitzgerald raised their price target to $125 and HC Wainwright increased theirs from $170 to $200.

# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.
*****
&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.
*****
&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December’s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday’s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.
*****
&gt; “This was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don’t think it’s dramatic,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Nonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.”
*****
&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter’s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday’s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.
*****
&gt; “It could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.
*****
&gt; “We may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. “I think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,” he said.
*****
&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.
*****
&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday’s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.
*****
&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he’s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.
*****
&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM’s strike. “I think there’s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,” he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.

# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years

&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.

&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.

# A Banner Year for US Equities

&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**

&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.

&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.

# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow

&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.

&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

&gt; Moving on to 2020, below is a list of this year's Dogs of the Dow. Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.

# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns

&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.

&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.

&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).

&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.

# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.

&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.

It might be a crowded trade, but the stock is still cheap, relative to the online retailer’s free cash flow.

“Buy Amazon” isn’t the world’s biggest stock-picking cliché, but it’s close. There are 49 analysts who cover the shares, and 47 of them are positive, with two neutral, according to FactSet. Only Alibaba Group Holding of China and ICICI Bank of India boast more endorsements.

And after a record-setting run-up, Amazon’s stock isn’t obviously inviting. A $1,000 stake at the close of the stock’s first day of trading in 1997 has turned into more than $950,000. The shares today, at $1,875, go for 69 times projected 2020 earnings.

Still, buy Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN). The stock price looks sensible when compared with free cash flow, which is swelling quickly. Some growth initiatives are only now paying off. Don’t expect a 35% gain this year, as Amazon has averaged, compounded, since going public. But don’t rule it out, either.

Amazon’s reputation for operating near break-even has long been outdated. Founder Jeff Bezos has emphasized free cash flow over accounting earnings from the start, and Amazon has generated free cash since 2002. The company has tended to invest much of that cash for growth, and the result is that earnings have been positive only since 2014, and only meaningfully so since 2018. Now the numbers are reaching escape velocity.

When 2019’s results are released, Wall Street expects Amazon to report that revenue increased by 20%, to $279.1 billion; that earnings rose slightly, to $10.4 billion; and that free cash flow ballooned by 28%, to $24.9 billion. In 2020, free cash flow is expected to expand even faster, by 36%, to $34 billion.

Within five years, the consensus view is that Amazon will become the biggest free cash generator in America, passing some companies that aren’t exactly standing still, like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The simplest reason is that Amazon’s investment spending can’t keep up with its growth rate forever.

Amazon launched Prime in 2005, with its free two-day shipping for members, and vast opportunities for the company to put capital to work building speedier infrastructure. Not long after, Amazon Web Services went into cloud computing, another path for investment. Both ventures have proved to be lucrative, with Prime spurring increased spending by shoppers, and AWS yielding generous profit margins.

Last year, Amazon said that it would spend to shorten free Prime shipping to a single day. There are early signs of that paying off, too. Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates that Prime membership grew 13% during the fourth quarter, versus a year earlier. That compares with 3% growth a year ago and would be the third straight quarter of acceleration.

Now, consider another of Amazon’s growth initiatives: advertising. A recent search for “men’s tennis rackets” on Amazon.com yielded editorial recommendations and a racket listing labeled “Amazon’s Choice.” But nothing was more prominently displayed than the three sponsored racket listings near the top—except for the paid ad for portable nets just above them.

Advertising doesn’t require vast investments in fleets and data farms, and it looks like another boon for Amazon’s growth. Ad revenue will rise 36%, to $17.6 billion, in 2020, and by 2025 will top $46 billion, predicts Cowen’s Blackledge. Assuming a 35% operating margin for the business, he estimates that advertising and AWS will together account for 90% of operating income this year.

That has important implications for shareholders. First, it bodes well for the competitiveness of a store when it doesn’t have to rely on its retail margins for the bulk of profits. Second, the advertising ramp provides another rich source of funds to invest in growth. Third, with Amazon passing the anniversary of its spending boost for Prime one-day, it is unclear that it will need that extra spending. As things stand, growth in capital expenditures is expected to decelerate from over 25% last year, to 16% this year, to under 10% in 2021.

Among 10 analysts who have estimated Amazon’s free cash flow out to 2021, the lowest says $32.7 billion, the highest says $57.5 billion, and the average is $43.7 billion. Out to 2024, there are only three estimates, averaging $82.8 billion. Apple, in comparison, is expected to produce close to $63 billion in free cash during its current fiscal year through September.

If distant estimates for Amazon are feasible, or even if they are only moderately overblown, the stock could continue outperforming. At less than 30 times estimated 2020 free cash flow, it is cheaper than the shares of Visa (V), Nike (NKE), or McDonald’s (MCD). From here, 20% annual gains for the next three years could leave the stock priced at a humbler 25 times free cash flow.

A government crackdown against powerful tech titans is a risk, but Amazon may have a better “who me?” defense than some of the others. Its market share in the public cloud is less than half, and falling, as Microsoft and others catch up. In e-commerce, more than half of its sales are from third-party merchants who pay to use its services. And in online advertising, it’s a pipsqueak next to Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).

All told, Amazon is popular with stockpickers for good reason. It’s not too late to join the crowd.

Those who received a classical education in the domain might know about the works of Schumpeter and Kondratieff whose described economic cycles in works that have made history in economic science.

Everyday that goes by the description of those cycles match a little bit more our current economy. We are currently (or just where) in a prosperity period where innovation drive competitivity and investment, the economic activities reach their maximum heights and the idle or unemployed resources are minimised. As we can see our markets reached historical heights that some starts to call ""pre-crisis"" levels and unemployment follow suit.

Innovation products displace the old ones and thus decrease their demand in the market. Consequently, the prices of old products fall. With a view to liquidating their stocks, the old firms start selling their goods at a low price and hence most of the firms incur losses and some firms are even forced to run into loss. Schumpeter describes the industry as being the source and first warning indicator of a crisis, this description can be seen today in current PMI index.

The events that follows are Investment declines and unemployment rise, leading to a fall in the aggregate demand. As the entrepreneurs start repaying bank loans, the quantity of money in circulation is reduced and prices start falling. Profits too decline and come to zero point. Uncertainty and risk increase. A wave of pessimism sweeps the entire economy and the boom period ends with the appearance of the phase of depression.

This phase appears to be the next step for us,  this would mean the current market trend is only induced by FOMO and confidence boosted by the fed rates.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The other day I heard that my ""playmoney"" might be better invested in short term investments. I found a few sources about long term funds but nothing really on how to get started with a bit of play money.

Does anyone have tips or sources for me to read into?

And this is on top of the repo market loans. The Fed plans on doing these monthly purchases into the second quarter of 2020. 

The Swiss Central Bank has also been purchasing US stocks since the Financial Collapse. My assumption is they are purchasing and then cashing out on US stocks and holding US Dollars for currency manipulation (check out their foreign currency investments—81,000 CHF in 2009 to 804,000 CHF in 2019). 

Do you think the actions from central banks will drive the US stock market higher into 2020? I’m curious what the opinions are here. I’ve been seeing plenty of articles out there attributing recent stock market gains to the Fed monetary actions, like this one:

As the bull market charges into 2020, here are 3 stocks under $20 billion market cap that I'm bullish about. Let me know if you enjoy these types of posts, and I'll come out with more picks in my portfolio!

**Guardant Health (**[**$GH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GH&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)**):**

I've long had the goal to do impact investing, for instance by buying funds, ETFs or individual stocks that are ESG rated or appear to have some positive effect in the world (e.g. clean energy).

But does holding, say, a clean energy portfolio actually help those companies or not?

I always thought that when the price of a stock goes up, say from 100 to 120, that company then has 20 more capital to invest. But I just learned that companies only earn actual cash from shares during the IPO, and then anything after is all secondary market. 

If I buy a clean energy ETF, does that help there being more clean energy in the world? Do those companies get access to cheaper capital at all? How should I think about this?

1. In late October, the custodian, **Joseph Passaqulua** had a shareholder letter that went out to an older shareholder list.  


In this, it stated that this company called **""Compelling Competitive Advantage LLC (CCA LLC)"" would merge with MILV**.  


2. That CCA LLC had an open contract with **University of Pennsylvania and Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia**  


Interestingly enough, a bunch of us needed to know more about this company and so the digging began.  


We found an old company by the name of Endeavor IP (more recently NanoLife Health) was 90% owned by CCA. **The major shareholders of the company were listed:**  


1. **James B. Hovis** (sold multiple drinking lines e.g. AQUISS Beverage to Egg. Co)
2.   
**Edward J. Mathias** (Senior Adviser to one of the WORLDS largest investment firms -- The Carlyle Group -- Assets $211 billion **AND AND AND A TRUSTER EMERITUS for University of Penn**... interesting)
3.   
**Michael W. Fountain** \-- **(microbiologist in liposome research ""a vehicle compound"", has 181 products, 131 international and domestic patents, sold a company for $575 million The Liposome Company) to Elan Corp.)**
4.   
**Larry Kubin** (Two time superbowl champion with Washington Redskins and advocate and spokesperson for traumatic brain injury)
5.   
**Stuart Yarbrough** (Crosshill Financial Group -- takes startups and gives them the money to build a successful company and makes them look good for big company acquisitions).  


What this means is that you have a lot of successful people and big names coming together to build a BIOTECH company to utilize MICHAEL W. FOUNTAINs patents for brain trauma therapy, recovery, prevention/

Find below the rationale behind choice of each index:

1. **Portfolio**: My portfolio which has changed over the year.
2. **S&amp;P 500**:    Standard &amp; Poor's top 500 US companies by market cap. It is one  of   the most commonly followed equity index, and many consider it one  of  the  best representations of the U.S. stock market, and a bellwether  for  the  U.S. economy\[[S&amp;P 500 wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index)\].
3. **DJIA**: Dow Jones Industrial Average is the average of 30 *significant* companies. It is the oldest and single most watched index in the world\[[Dow Jones Industrial Average - DJIA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp)\].
4. **NASDAQ**: The Nasdaq-100 Index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on *The Nasdaq Stock Market* based on market capitalization\[[NASDAQ 100](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/indices/nasdaq-100.aspx)\]. Nasdaq 100 is dominated by tech companies accounting for *54%* of the index\[[Tech importance in NASDAQ 100](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq100.asp)\].    This 54% does not include companies like Amazon which is generally    regarded as tech but is considered otherwise in financial circles.    Nasdaq 100 aligns well with my portfolio since my portfolio is tech    heavy too.
5. **NYSE**: The NYSE Composite (*$NYA*) is a stock market index covering all common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange\[[NYSE Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYSE_Composite)\]. I used this as a proxy for the stocks in *NYSE*. As expected this performed the worst since it is a composite index.
6. **VGT**:    Vanguard Information Technology ETF seeks to track the performance of  a   benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in  the   information technology sector\[[VGT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VGT)\].    An argument can be made whether this is the best performing tech ETF.    With the gift of hindsight, clearly it is not. I felt that the   companies  constituting this etf represents the whole gamut of tech   companies in  comparison to more specific tech ETFs like *IGV*, *SOXX* or *XSW*.

2. If you do think a stock is going to dip, and you want to hold money to buy in at a lower point, but you don't want cash to just sit there, is it smart to put that money into something really liquid like SPY and when the time comes, sell off some of SPY to buy the stock when it dips?

When that happened, railroad stocks did really well, but you know what did better?  Iron ore. That’s because iron ore was required to make the steel for all the rails. Even people like Rockefeller bought out iron ore mines as a way to profit from that trend. Or imagine if you’d owned oil stocks back in 1895 when gasoline was invented and patented. A massive new market opened up for this commodity. So when you get this leading edge of really big trends unfolding, there’s always a commodities implication. Everything that we use on Earth is grown or dug up from the ground. So there’s always something that benefits from these big-picture trends.

&amp;#x200B;

So there are a few different aspects to the 5G revolution. And they touch on different technologies that are involved and the corresponding commodities. To put it most simply, there is a lot of fiber optic cable that’s involved. 5G thrives on fiber optics to transmit the signal. So there’s a whole network across America and across the world of new fiber optic cable that needs to be laid. Now, most people are aware of that. But what we don’t think about as much is that the cable that’s required for 5G is different than the cable we’ve used in the past.

 

Well, the specific metal that I’m talking about in regard to 5G fiber optics is called erbium. Most people haven’t heard of erbium, but it’s actually part of a larger group of metals that many investors also aren’t familiar with. I’m talking about rare earth metals. So rare earth metals became prominent almost a decade ago, when China suddenly cut off exports… and some of the prices for rare earth metals like promethium rocketed 1,000% *in a matter of months*. Share prices of rare earth companies went up 10,000% in some cases. That type of gain is hard to wrap your head around. But for perspective, that means a $100 investment would have turned into $10,000. $1,000 would have turned into $100,000… And a $10,000 investment would have made you a millionaire. Another way to think about it is that shareholders in tiny rare earth stocks made more in a few months than Apple shareholders made in the prior 16 years of Apple gains – combined. It was a crazy time… and now we have a shot for similar gains by betting on the right rare earth companies. Things haven’t really even started picking up big time, and my subscribers are already up over 53% on one of my rare earth elements picks… and up nearly 150% on the other.

The effects have also been seen in cloud computing with Amazon and Microsoft, and advertising with Google/Amazon (faster networks/easier access = more searches)

I still follow buy and hold strategy and only sell stocks when I don't like certain changes in a company. Sometimes those decisions paid off, sometimes (AAPL) I missed out a bit (nevertheless I don't regret those decisions). 

At some point I was down 30-50% on both NVDA and TSLA, I do strongly believe in both those companies and will not sell either of them in the next 5y for sure. Hitting a bigger number on the portfolio I started diversifying a bit as well. (MA,V,MRK)

Strategy for 2020 is pretty simple for me, I'll invest mostly in AI and cybersececurity companies: First priority is to add a ton of Tencent. Highly recommend the book: ""AI Superpowers Book by Kai-Fu Lee"". imo there is no way around AI and probably Asia will be in the driving seat for the first time in 5-10y.

**Be patient, don't panic sell, it might be swingy here and there but if you invest in strong companies it will pay off.**

Their streaming service is going nowhere, and will only have more content.  Very especially if more sports are added to espn+, this package will be a need/want for most households and individuals.  

I think Toy Story land was a bad idea, and only made to capitalize on a fad they hoped would catch, but then they made fucking forky.  Who thought that was a marketable object?!?!?!  Also, kids today just aren’t that into Toy Story, kids from the 90s were. Kids from the 90s have kids today who wanna see spiderman. 

It just so happens Disney will have 3 Avengers lands by 2023: California, Paris, and Hong Kong.   I think those parks will crush Star Wars land numbers.  People will also be getting over Harry Potter Land, meaning Disney will be poaching those $$ from those who would’ve had to choose between parks.

Amazon.com is the top stock pick for 2020 among analysts at research firm Baird.

The e-commerce giant, whose stock has climbed 23% in 2019, has “significant growth opportunities” across its various business lines, Baird analysts said in a note Tuesday. Cloud expansion and improved margin trends, expected to take shape during the second quarter, will be catalysts for the stock, the analysts said.

Besides singling out Amazon (ticker: AMZN) as a top pick, the Baird team is generally bullish on platform technology companies such as Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), urging investors: “Don’t bet against the internet!”

Even after all of the advancements in technology that defined the “bustling” 2010s, Baird analysts predict that the next decade will see a “bounty of meaningful technology transitions,” including quantum computing, artificial general intelligence, and the rollout of 6G. (Yes, you read that right—the 5G dream is barely realized and talk has already started on 6G.)

To be sure, there are headwinds for some of this tech exuberance.

Big tech has come under the scrutiny of lawmakers due to antitrust concerns and fears over how users’ data is used. Politicians are expected to ramp up their attacks during the 2020 election cycle, but Baird analysts dismiss that as “posturing.” The real risk to tech players won’t be forced breakups but management distraction and inaction spurred by the noise. A slowdown in innovation and M&amp;A is possible, they say.

As for what will drive growth for Amazon and other tech companies, Baird sees several opportunities over the coming decade:

• Networking speeds will increase, boosting efficiencies. Some of the largest platform companies may begin building their own chips and processors.

• There will be new user interfaces as the capabilities of augmented and virtual reality increase, potentially leading to new ways to access e-commerce and online media.

• Media subscription models will continue to dominate, but there may not be much room for many more players in the space.

• “Connected everything,” which means our cars and homes may be an extension of today’s connected devices.

• Cloud wars will continue, providing a huge opportunity for Amazon, Alphabet’s Google, Alibaba, and Microsoft (MSFT).

• E-commerce will be everywhere, and digital-payment options will increase.

It debuted in 2017 and is still trading at its debut price two years later. This is what I have gathered so far.

**Products:** 

Redfin- their traditional service. They charge a 1.5% listing fee for homes listed on their website.

Redfin Mortgage- they recently started offering mortgages to their customers. The approval process is completely online.

RedfinNow- Redfin buys homes, fixes them and sells them. Allows sellers cash and an easy selling process and puts the pressure on Redfin to sell the home. 

Title Foward- Is a service that steps in once an offer has been accepted to help facilitate the next steps in the process. 

**Profitability:** It is not yet profitable, but they did just raise their listing fee from 1% to 1.5% and that is not being talked about from what I have seen. It seems like no company is profitable when they issue an IPO these days, so that does not seem to be to much of a concern. Even so, they seem to be on their way to positive cash flow within the next 5 years at the most. 

**Growth:** I think the growth for RDFN is really interesting. They have been expanding into new markets in all their services. They are trying to have complete vertical integration in their services. The problem with their service right now is that they offer no service to renters. This could really expand their business as Americans are renting now more then ever. They could use a flat fee to list rental options on  their website or could offer a property management service for rental property owners to sign up for. 

As they continue vertical integration I think they could start to buy small local real estate agencies. They could keep the name, in a way funeral homes operate. With ownership showing willingness to own properties, I think it would be smart to get into the property management business in a small capacity as well. This way they can rent out spaces on leases in the retail or other spaces and have guaranteed income, similar to how REIT stocks operate. This will help to maintain shareholder value in times when home sales are down.

I recently created a Dividend Discord server focused primarily on dividend investing to create a place where you can chat real-time with other investors (or people interested in becoming investors).  The main channel is for dividend stocks, and the other investment channel is for non-dividend investments (including all asset classes such as real estate or crypto or non-dividend stocks).

We quickly have grown to almost 400 investors strong. We have folks in there with decades of experience that are millionaires, and people who have never invested and are just interested to learn, and everything in between... From teenagers to people in their 70s.

&amp;#x200B;

We also have a variety of non-investment channels (news, movies &amp; tv, gaming, sports, politics, misc) for people to bs about whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to check it out and just lurk :)

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I'm thinking of moving my RRSP into a self directed account (investors edge) and investing mostly into VTI (10k or so), a bond fund and a dividend etf (sdiv, spyd, sphd or something else?), since I wouldn't have to pay the withholding tax. I think that's better than keeping it all in a ""safe"" bond fund whilst paying the 2.4 MER or whatever it is. 

I'm also just getting started with questtrade, will be contributing about $500 monthly and have bought sq, visa and a little bit of dgaz (down 48%) but what else is a good buy nowadays? Im looking at AMD, AQN, BA, MSFT, TSLA, SPCE, ENPH, MGI, BAM, ENB, CSCO, NEE, ABBV, FB

One year ago, Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster and his colleagues laid out a set of tech predictions for 2019. His top call: “Apple will be the best performing FAANG stock in 2019.” He nailed it, and sees five reasons Apple stock will continue rising.

One year ago, Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster and his colleagues laid out a set of tech predictions for 2019. His top call: “Apple will be the best performing FAANG stock in 2019.”

He nailed it: As we near year-end, Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) has rallied 86% year to date, well ahead of the other FAANGs: Facebook stock (FB) has rallied 59%; Amazon.com stock (AMZN), 24%; Netflix stock (NFLX), 23%; and Alphabet stock (GOOGL) (G as in Google), 30%.

While he’s lately been investing in startups, Munster built his reputation earlier in his career as an equity analyst covering Apple stock, generally bullishly, at Piper Jaffray.

Munster’s call on Apple’s big 2019 not only got the stock right—he also correctly called what drove the stock higher: A new focus on services, a better position than rivals on regulatory issues, and investor anticipation of 5G iPhones in 2020 and beyond.

Yep, Munster nailed it this year, and he’s going for it again.

Last week, Munster and Loup rolled out a set of predictions for 2020. And it starts with this one: “Apple is our pick for top performing FAANG stock in 2020.” He thinks fair value for Apple stock is in the $350 to $400 range, which implies a potential gain of more than 30%. On Monday, the stock is down about 1% at $286.79.
Munster offers five reasons he thinks the stock will keep rolling in 2020.

Easy iPhone comparisons: He thinks Apple is likely to meet or exceed analyst expectations in three of the four quarters of 2020 based on easy iPhone comparisons — he notes that iPhone sales were down year-over-year in all four quarters of fiscal 2019. He thinks iPhone will account for 20% of Apple’s revenue in fiscal 2020.

Wearables: Munster says Apple’s wearables sales will be larger than those for the Mac in 2020, driven by a new version of the AirPod with better battery life and continued growth for Apple Watch. There’s also the launch of a much-anticipated product called Apple Tags, which Munster says will attach to keys, wallets and other things to keep track of their locations. He sees wearables sales up 45% in 2020, driven primarily by AirPods and Apple Watch. “Beyond 2020, Apple Watch has significant room to grow, given that global Apple Watch adoption remains nascent,” he writes. “We expect 20%-30% Apple Watch unit growth for the next five years.” He thinks that by 2025, Apple Watch sales can reach $48 billion, or about 12% of Apple’s overall revenue.

New iPhone Models: Munster expects five new iPhone models in 2020, versus three new models in each of the last two years. All eyes are on the expected 5G launches in late 2020.

Investors Await 5G: Munster made this forecast a year ago, and updates it this time. “5G will be the biggest iPhone upgrade cycle since 2015, which benefited from the first full year of the larger-screen iPhone 6,” he writes. “Long term, we believe the 5G cycle can deliver two years of 10% iPhone revenue growth, compared to our expectation of iPhone revenue essentially flat in calendar 2020. That said, the iPhone 5G cycle will hit full stride in 2022 and 2023. We expect the product’s first full year (2021) to disappoint investors due to lack of 5G coverage from wireless carriers, which will act as a governor on iPhone 5G adoption.”

Multiple Expansion: “We expect AAPL’s earnings multiple to increase in 2020,” he writes. “Investors will begin to recognize Apple’s combination of hardware and services as a high-visibility and sticky business. The prevailing investor view is that shares of AAPL should be undervalued relative to peers based on a belief that the company’s risk profile is relatively higher, because 75% of its revenue comes from hardware. Over the past decade, Apple’s results have shown that the combination of hardware, software, and services can deliver earnings, the most important measure of financial strength, that exceed other tech companies with higher multiples. Over the next year, we believe investors will gain confidence in applying a more services-like multiple to AAPL given the hardware business (iPhone and wearables) will deliver revenue visibility similar to traditional services businesses.”

# Redistributing winners in IRA

📷

Hi I was looking for some thoughts and opinions on redistributing assets within my IRA. Apple MSFT and V have all been big winners for me over the past few years. The one that particularly stands out is Apple which has run up an insane amount over the past few year. Would it be wise to split my apple position into another stock or etf? Typically I like to hold my positions but when we approach extremes it makes me wonder. Some other points I should make is that I own a variety of etfs and mutual funds that hold apple and I have another smaller group of shares in a non ira account which I will just let run for tax reasons. I also have a strong allocation to healthcare and information technology in all my accounts.

So should I hold apple or split it into

VOO

QQQ

MPC

MRK

ABBV

Hey all, I am an international graduate student in the US and was thinking of investing some of my stipend. I was confused between making a 3-4 fund portfolio or just going in with a target-date fund. I read that ETFs are a bit more tax-efficient as compared to mutual funds (here target-date funds). Since I will be investing about 500$ per month, I was a bit skeptical about rebalancing and calculating how to much to invest each month, and was looking at the target-date fund to that all for me.

I would really appreciate if anyone could share with me their insights on how much tax-efficient ETFs really are, and a tried method of investing about 500$ (with about 10-20% in bonds) in a 3 fund portfolio.

Thanks a lot, guys, and Happy Holidays!

P.S. I didn't go for a tax-advantaged account because I wasn't sure if I will still be in the states when I reach the retirement age, and after reading a few posts I concluded that withdrawing the money from India from a Roth IRA (when I reach 60) is not an easy and efficient process.

Since we're at the top of the market, do you think it would be a wise strategy to leave my original investment of 90,000 and pull out the 35,000 in profits and invest in a 5-year high-yield CD.

My attitude being something like ""if this keeps dropping that much, it's junk and I'm done with it!"" After a lot of reading on different strategies (and recently losing a good position at a low dip), I've learned I can do MUCH better.

I read one article suggesting setting it around a recent low, on the basis that if it drops past that, it's likely headed in another direction for longer.

I was thinking of setting a stop limit at the 1 week low, with the limit 5-10% under that. My additional logic being that I should be able to protect profits from weeks up until the last. Of course alongside the above, where if it drops below last week, it probably has more time to go down.

This should always protect some of my profits, so worst case, I can walk away from a trade a little better than break even.

I don't think I've read more news articles about recessions/corrections during this year than any other, i see ads on ""how to survive a recession"" How to prepare for a recession &amp; etc. If you use google trend and search for the word recession or correction it's increased which obviously means more people are searching for those specific keywords.

We have also seen our first inversion in 10 years, an inversion has predicted all recessions the past 50 years and predicted 7 recession, however a recession can occur years after an inversion. USA will also have their presidential election in November 2020 which could cause volatility in the stock market however the economy seems to be doing pretty well and the trade war seems to be settling.

I've read and speculated on so many factors i can't cover everything in this post but i choose out some factors i believe can cause a correction/recession.

**5 Stocks: 26,46% - $13 230**

**4 Funds: 29,72% - $14 861**

I've also decided to not invest anything during 2020 until we see are recession/correction and when i'm going to start invest again i'm thinking of dividing the cash with either 24 or 18 to get an even purchase price in case it keeps going down.

I've been doing a small bit of paper trading in various blue chip stocks and only a small but of actual real money trading with $200 but I'm 19 and I've recently landed a $1220 weekly income as an independent contractor in logistics and I now have $13000 with more coming in every week. I've said this idea to my old fashioned parents which their response is ""Lifes not that easy"" and that kind of ideology.

It would take weeks for the fees to accumulate $650 which is to say it only rises one percent. Can anyone. Is it possible to rinse and repeat this process to hopefully accumulate over $1000 a week or is there something huge that I'm missing out on. 
P.S. I know it isn't certain that stock prices will rise and have the ability to fall and cost me a considerable amount of capital as well as running into arrears but this is all said with the intent of researching into big companies which are nearly guaranteed to not fall dramatically soon and have a high probability of rising even by %0.5 over a few days which would still fetch a profit of 325 with the figure mentioned at present.

I've been doing a small bit of paper trading in various blue chip stocks and only a small but of actual real money trading with $200 but I'm 19 and I've recently landed a $1220 weekly income as an independent contractor in logistics and I now have $13000 with more coming in every week. I've said this idea to my old fashioned parents which their response is ""Lifes not that easy"" and that kind of ideology. The stock broker I've been looking on is Etoro which seems pretty bad compared to the American apps but Etoro is what I've found to be the best available in Ireland as the main ones like WeBull and Robinhood aren't yet. But with my 13,000 leveraged X5 which is $65,000 worth of an investment which is available to every retail investor on Etoro at a $14.41 daily rate and a weekend rate of $43.23. What is the catch with investing in Big stocks such as Coca Cola, Tesla, Apple, Facebook etc and cashing out exactly when it rises over 1% which it seems to do at least once a week bought at the right time like when its in the red.  1% of 65,000  is $650 minus however many days it takes. It would take weeks for the fees to accumulate $650 which is to say it only rises one percent. Can anyone. Is it possible to rinse and repeat this process to hopefully accumulate over $1000 a week or is there something huge that I'm missing out on. 
P.S. I know it isn't certain that stock prices will rise and have the ability to fall and cost me a considerable amount of capital as well as running into arrears but this is all said with the intent of researching into big companies which are nearly guaranteed to not fall dramatically soon and have a high probability of rising even by 0.5% over a few days which would still fetch a profit of 325 with the figure mentioned at present.

Im a 25 year old from the UK currently living in New Zealand (working visa, not a resident). I’ve been in the stock realm for about a year or 2 now, and I’ve recently gotten a much higher paying job that allows me to save even more money after monthly bills, rent etc, which has resulted in me having about £10k to play with (after putting another £5k emergency money stashed away). About £4k of this I’ve delegated to various stock picks like Tesla, Apple, AMD, Boeing etc, but the rest I’ve been considering putting into a Vanguard LifeStrategy ISA on a 5 year plan, just to diversify my investments further and to take advantage of the tax-free ISA wrappers. 

My question might be more relevant to UK-based folks in here, but would anyone recommend doing an ISA as oppose to putting the rest of this money into individual stocks, ETFs, etc? Or is there something else I should consider? Vanguard’s LifeStrategy funds look pretty well diversified and offer a fairly decent return (taking the last 5 years into account and doing an average % return as a rough idea for what my ROI could be), but naturally I’d like to be as efficient with my money as possible and I thought I’d get some ideas/opinions/recommendations from you all before I go making any decisions, seeing as 5 years is a big commitment to locking away this money with monthly payments into it.

Right now my eyes are on the LifeStrategy80 or 100 on a 5 year plan. From what I’ve read, it’s recommended to do at least 5 years for greater returns and to really allow the pot to grow.

I placed my money into the S&amp;P 500 and waited until last week, when I bought SHOP at $396.28. That has shown a good little return, but I am nervous about the volatility and especially nervous because I am hearing that institutional investors  can drive prices down at the beginning of the year. So I am going to sell my shares and wait to see what happens to the market in January.

My general understanding in how stock price fluctuates is through supply and demand (more stocks investors buy  a single company the number of outstanding shares goes down and hence the stock price goes up, and vise versa.).

Since Kalanick sold the rest of his shares of 5.8 million, I would expect the stock price the plummet on December 20th since that's pretty significant amount of stocks to be sold, but looking back around that time, Uber stock price hovered between $30-$31.

Today's subject is what may happen to stock market vs. housing prices over the next ten years in this amateur's opinion. 

March of 2007 saw peak median new home prices in the US at $262K. This bottomed two years later at $209K. The next March to surpass 2007 values was 2014, at $282K median. I believe these numbers are not inflation adjusted so the 2014 recovery is probably ""early"" (if 2007 numbers were ever really met at all during the current bubble). 

Since then, the current market peaked at $343K in Nov and Dec of 2017. The lowest months since have been January and July of 2019, at $305K and $308K respectively, with pricing continuing to trend lower year over year at a rate that may be accelerating. 

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS#0

While the housing market peaked in 2016-2017, the pricing deceleration has languished behind the rapid drops we saw in 2007-2009, when it took 24 months for median March new home prices to fall 22% nationally. 24 months after Nov-Dec 2017, the market is still dropping, and the decrease to date has only been a bit over 10% in the worst months. 

The peak-&gt;bust of the 2007 housing bubble coincided with a similar bust in the stock market beginning in 2008 (the peak was in June 07, the bottom fell out in September 08, and the bottom was reached in March 09). My analysis of it is this, at first people could not afford their home payments etc so that began to go belly up, and then, people had to sell their assets to pay for their homes (and other things) that were now inflated, and many panic sold in the process, when it became clear home prices were tanking in many metros and some stocks (banks etc) would simultaneously become worthless. 

Fast-forward to 2019. Conditions are VERY different 24 months after the peak of the 2017 housing numbers compared to 24 months after the 2007 numbers. In fact, the S&amp;P is up about 20% since Nov '17. BUT, there WAS a stock market crash in 2018, albeit much less severe than 2008. From its then-ATH of 2,916 in 9/18, the S&amp;P fell to 2,416 last Christmas, a drop of 17%, which was actually about double the magnitude of the January drop in housing numbers. That is nothing compared to the 50%+ drop the S&amp;P saw from max to min in 07-09, but it was still pretty major.

This brings me to my next point. Following the simultaneous downturn in housing and stock we saw in 2018, one of those categories has seen TREMENDOUS gains in 2019. Hint, it wasn't housing -- the S&amp;P is up 30%+ from its Dec'19 lows!

Meanwhile, new housing $s are down ~10% from a year ago. 

In the period from 2007 peak to 2019 today, new home median sales prices have risen ~50K, or about 20% (not inflation adjusted). In the same time, the S&amp;P has more than DOUBLED. 

When accounting for the increasing property taxes nationwide, which have partly originated from the bubble (municipality says omg look expensive houses! taxes go up, and then the president also makes $10K+ in taxes not deductible, OMG!), it is becoming increasingly clear -- at least to my eyes -- that the US is potentially staring a systemic housing crisis in the face, in certain regions. 

In 2008, the broad-based correction across the board was alleviated by demographics as Baby Boomers were not yet that old and the Silent Generation was pretty small, leaving the demographic pyramid sufficient to more than make up for the recession (through 2017, that is). This is a national problem. The US has more immigration and a higher birthrate than Japan so their deflationary spiral in the 1990s is not a great analogy but it does illustrate how some asset prices can fall FOREVER.

Back on this side of the Pacific, my handy inflation calculator says that median new home prices have been completely flat since 2007, having actually fallen from an adjusted $325K in '19 dollars that year to today's $310Kish. But 2019 is not 2009. The stock market is still healthy. Its returns since 2009 have been phenomenal. And as external costs to real estate (taxes etc) have increased, stocks relative value has SOARED. 

What does this mean going forward?

In my opinion, the correction in home prices now underway will continue for the entirety of the next decade. It won't be a sharp drop like 2008. It will be a continued steady decline, with some regions of high growth + restricted supply staying steady or slowly rising (DC metro is probably the best candidate), while most others will begin to buckle under demographic pressures. 

However, the REASON for this tumbling is demographic. Baby boomers aging out. They aren't selling their homes in a panic, most won't get repossessed, and they are not going to chase their home payments with asset (stock) sales, as happened in 2008. These will be homes that are generally completely paid-off, languishing on the market, until forlorn millennial families cobbles enough dollars together to buy. 

The reasoning for the housing crash now commencing (and likely to continue) is actually SUPPORTIVE of the stock market's continued bull run into the 2020s. With no yearly property tax and actual growth thanks to the growing global population, the stock market is poised to continue booming into the next decade. I don't think the boom will be distributed equally across all asset classes -- IMO, as environmental degradation worsens alongside inequality, the ""fake world"" of the internet is going to take the lion's share of gains -- but I do think we will set continuous new ATHs across the S&amp;P and NASDAQ annually until the late 2020s. There will likely be a minor correction or three thrown into the mix (a la the 2012-&gt;2019 period), but there will yield to the continuous global growth and influx of $ due to demographic transition now underway.

I have dubbed this impending phenomenon ""di-flation"". While I think official inflation #s will remain very under control, it belies a gaping chasm that is now developing, where home prices are about to begin deflating, and stock prices will be inflating (severely).

Been a long time stock investment lurker. I hold some general financial markets knowledge, but I am mostly an amateur when it comes to future stock value prediction. So I would be greateful if you guys could lend me some financial advice in regard to stock investment.

I wish to start with $1500 dollars initally, and as the months will progress I was planning on expanding my potential portfolio by roughly $700 each month. 

My intention is long term investment, it is way too early for me to deal with options, so I assume I should be looking at stocks that have the potential to slowly but ""surely"" grow without dragging too much risk into it. Does this make sense?

What do you guys think I should be investing into? Most of the companies that came to my mind are naturally quite expensive, APPL, GOOG, TSLA, NFLX etc. - so is it perhaps better to pursue companies that are not as valuable yet? Perhaps in the range of $30 - $50 per stock?

Boeing $BA fired its CEO Dennis Mullenburg after he failed to contain the fall out from the 747 Max airline crashes and Uber’s $UBER co-founder, Travis Kalanick, stepped down from the board after selling his remaining stake in the company.  Both moves were popular and were initially well received although stock price gains were largely returned by Friday.


Elsewhere, shares of Intra-Cellular Therapies $ITCI soared after the company reported FDA approval on Monday for Caplyta (lumateperone) for treating schizophrenia.  The stock is now up 200% with a market capitalization of $2 billion but still looks reasonable compared to a TAM of $15 billion that is expected to grow to $20.5 billion by 2026. 


Intra-Cellular Therapies expects to launch Caplyta at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and investors are clearly excited by the news of marketing approval. It will become the first commercialized asset of Intra-Cellular Therapies. 



Innovative Industrial Properties $IIPR reported on Monday that it had purchased two properties in Pennsylvania and North Dakota comprising 105,000 square feet of industrial space. 
It’s the second purchase in two months for Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. ($IIPR) and will increase total industrial space by 7.5%. It also follows some insider buying last week as the CEO bought $140,000 of stock.  


IIPR is a cannabis REIT acquiring and leasing medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities. That’s lucrative because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Its weighted-average lease length is 15.5 years, with an average return on invested capital of 13.6%. In other words, Innovative Industrial Properties will see a complete payback on its investments in a little over five years, but should have steady and predictable cash flow for more than a decade.


Growing rapidly with a dividend of over 5% and insider buying.  It is probably a stock that you should have a look at.

It’s annoying because I can’t even place new stop orders without getting a message that the order was rejected because it will make my BP negative.  

So my questions are:

1) is it normal for an account’s BP to change so dramatically when the accounts value hasn’t changed very little immediately before the change (up $1 today, but up $3000 over the past three months)?

V. MYL due to challenging business conditions in North America and pricing pressure. Year to date, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 28.6% against the industry’s growth of 8.3%. Let us look at some of the challenges, which plagued the company this year, and whether or not it holds any promise going into the next.

 

A Close Introspection

Generic maker Mylan has not seen the best of 2019 for a few reasons. The company’s North America segment witnessed lower sales of existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, including the loss of exclusivity on tadalafil.

It also faced legal issues. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges against the company in connection with its EpiPen product probe. The SEC charged Mylan for accounting and disclosure failures relating to a Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into whether the company overcharged Medicaid by hundreds of millions of dollars for its largest product, EpiPen. The SEC stated that investors were kept in the dark about EpiPen misclassification and the potential loss the company faced as a result of the pending investigation into the misclassification. Consequently, Mylan has agreed to pay $30 million as charges for the same. Moreover, the complaint alleges that Mylan produced documents and other information to DOJ, including potential damage calculations and offers for settlement. The allegations of misclassification and resultant charges further added to Mylan’s woes. 

Moreover, rival Teva Pharmaceutical TEVA has already won FDA approval for the first generic version of Mylan’s EpiPen and EpiPen Jr, which, in turn, will unfavorably impact sales further.

Earlier, there were allegations against Mylan and Teva for inflating the prices of generic drugs. Both companies were also accused of obstructing a probe on the same by a few lawmakers.

Can the Stock Stage a Comeback in 2020?

In July, Mylan announced a merger agreement with Upjohn, Pfizer's PFE off-patent branded and generic established medicines business (includes Lipitor, Celebrex and Viagra), to create a new global pharmaceutical company.  Per the agreement, which is structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction, each Mylan share would be converted into one share of the new company. Mylan had previously undertaken a strategic review of its business due to challenging business conditions in North America and pricing pressure. The decision to merge with Upjohn comes as a result of this review.

Pfizer’s shareholders would own 57% of the combined entity, while Mylan’s shareholders would own the remaining 43%. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies.

The new company will be named Viatris upon the closing of the merger, which is expected in mid-2020. Viatris will boast a diverse portfolio across many geographies and focus on key therapeutic areas.

This merger looks encouraging for the company. The transaction will allow the new company to meaningfully expand the geographic reach of Mylan’s existing broad product portfolio and future pipeline — including significant investments in complex generics and biosimilars — into new growth markets where Upjohn has existing sales infrastructure and local market expertise.

Thus, with this merger, Mylan could see a brighter 2020.

The company also launched a few key products in 2019.

Mylan and partner Biocon Ltd. launched Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst), a biosimilar to Roche Holding AG’s RHHBY blockbuster breast cancer drug Herceptin, in the United States.

These new launches along with the company’s key products, including Yupelri, Copaxone, Fulphila and Wixela Inhub, are likely to help revive  growth,

Mylan is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, currently. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

I have a question regarding some of my stocks. A little backstory first. I got into the stocks when during high school with SONY and HEAR and didn't really invest until last year.

My Uncle got wind of it and set up a joint Vanguard account with me to help me out. He gave me $1000 and had chosen specific stocks to get me started. When I am 21, the account will automatically give full control to me. And I turn 21 this May so only a matter of months. We both run and it he says that it's mine now but be can help out. 

To get me started, he invested in VOO, HEAR, AAPL, CSCO, FB, and NFLX. Eventually, he got rid HEAR because they started to bad after raising for pennies to $30 a stock. So he put that money into AMD, which I thought was a fantastic idea.

But now, I am thinking of mixing it up a bit. I was thinking of selling NFLX and CSCO to buy one more stock of VOO and put the rest into some sort of video game company, like TCEHY, TTWO, ATVI, or NTDOY.

A Forbes article says that may have to be revised down.

10% Earnings growth would require the 5% revenue growth forecast PLUS net margin expansion. However net margins at 11% are already above historic averages (after Trump's tax boost in 2018) and a fall back to 10% averages looks more likely.

Any downward revision would likely have a significant impact on sentiments and valuations.

The last time the stock market valuations traded at this level (with a forward PE of 18.1) was in January 2018 when there was a sharp correction.  On Friday, CNN's Fear and Greed Indexwas at 91 out of 100.  At these levels, it seems likely that the only way is down.

Thats not the end of the world, and nobody can be sure when the correction will come, but investors with shorter investing horizons would be wise to consider a partial pivot into cash or gold.

Outline:

In the past decade $25 trillion in stock market value was added, with especially tech stocks being great performers. The next decade is expected to continue the tech revolution. Another sector that is expected to see high growth is the renewable energy sector and industries related to it.

Analysts expect more cheap money from central banks ahead, and other government stimuli to delay an inevitable recession.

The halt to further globalization and inflated stock prices due to low interest rates would predict that average returns in the next decade will be lower.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

My name is Leyton and i'm 20 years old. My father introduced me to the stock market back in 2016 at age 16 and since then i've been mainly investing in stocks. I'm also from a small town in Sweden and before graduating high school i decided i wanted to become financially independent and that's what's my journey's about. I'm currently living at home to invest as much as possible but before 2022 i'm defiently going to buy myself an apartment and the plan is to reach a net worh of 100 000$ before 2022. My other interests aside from stocks are politics, psychology, Music and movies.

***All My Income Sources***

Since i'm trying to speed up the process of becoming financially independent i've also earned money aside from just working on my job. I've earned 345$ by driving people during holidays, i've earned 198$ from lending out money to people but i've stopped with these two income sources since i've realised i'll probably earn more money in the long run if i educate myself instead of hunting these small income sources.  I've also reached the overtime limit at my workplace of 200 hours which to me is a big achivement. My coworkers call me insane and for me it feels like a receipt that i'm headed in the right direction.

***How much money i've earned and from what:***

From my ordinary job i've earned exactly 35 305$ after taxes and from side hustling i've made 543$. With these incomes combined i've made a total of 35 848$ which i'm really proud of. During the year i've invested 26 553$ which is 74,08% of my income and the rest 9 295$ is expenses.

* Average monthly income: 2 987$
* Invested/month: 2 212$
* Expenses/month: 775$

***How the year started &amp; Portfolio Growth***

In the beginning of 2019 i started with a total net worth of 14 636$ due to a falling stock market in the end of 2018, the market turned bullish in January and since then it's been a pretty smooth sailing. Today i have a net worth of 49 935$ which is a gain of 241%, My portfolio has increased with 48,93% (ROI), i've invested 26 553$. I focused on dollar-cost-averaging most of the stocks i already owned and building what i think is a perfect portfolio.

***My stock portfolio***

***Stocks: ATVI - GOOG - AMZN - AAPL - AZA - WEED - EA - MSFT - NFLX - NVDA - SAAB B - SWED A - UBER***

I'm currently working on building myself a complete stock portfolio, it takes enormous amount of time to find stocks i like but hopefully i'll be satisfied one day. I also own three swedish funds but they are only available in Sweden, if you're interested i'll let you know.

***Results***

* Starting Net Worth*:* 14 636$
* *Profit from investments:* 9 171$ (48,93%)
* Invested as total: 26 553$
* Today's Net Woth: 49 935$

***My plans for 2020***

I've sold stocks for 13 331$ and saved 3 670$ so i'll be starting 2020 with 32 934$ invested and 17 001$ as ready assets. I won't invest anything until we have a correction or might even a recession. I could motivate my decision but i've written enough today..

I'm 21, married, in college, and have $22,000 to invest. I'm an avid gamer and feel good about the future of game development and esports. Blizzard is rebuilding its reputation with Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 and has secured its place in the esports market, and EA has done the same with Apex. ESPO has performed very well over the last year, and the future of Blizzard's, EA's, Riot's, and Epic's pro leagues look good enough to continue carrying it. 

I'm pairing these with Microsoft and Amazon because of their consistent growth and positions in their industries. I think Tesla is the future of EV, but its volatility is intimidating.

I'm terrified the next crash will be in 2020, but I'm reading everywhere that ""time in the market beats timing the market."" I plan to invest as soon as I decide on my portfolio.

I decided I have enough knowledge of how the market works and so early in November I took about 75% of the money I made working in the summer and invested it into Apple. My dad, whose pretty experienced in the stock market, kept telling me to cash out when I had only made like $200 profit, but I told him I was in it for the long term.

It may be time for a post-Christmas sanity check for investors on Amazon’s surprisingly lagging stock.

While Amazon touted a “record-breaking” holiday shopping season in a post Christmas Day press release, it’s really two stats from the highlight reel that should question why Amazon’s stock (AMZN) has been stuck in neutral at all.

First, Amazon said 5 million new customers started Prime free trials or began paid memberships worldwide. Let’s assume that all 5 million of those customers end up being paid Prime members — that’s $595 million in annual run rate recurring sales assuming the service’s $119 annual fee. Not too shabby of a recurring revenue stream, which could go onto be higher as Prime members spend throughout the Amazon ecosystem. It could also help Amazon easily fund its ambitious new investments in same-day delivery and dare we day, electric autos (see recent Rivian investment).",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,455472,public,self,Amazon's record-breaking holiday season includes two killer stats but its stock has surprisingly lagged,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/efvw7l/amazons_recordbreaking_holiday_season_includes/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Required info to start understanding options:

* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy
* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell

Abstract

We provide detailed descriptions, including over 550 mathematical formulas, for over 150 trading strategies across a host of asset classes (and trading styles). This includes stocks, options, fixed income, futures, ETFs, indexes, commodities, foreign exchange, convertibles, structured assets, volatility (as an asset class), real estate, distressed assets, cash, cryptocurrencies, miscellany (such as weather, energy, inflation), global macro, infrastructure, and tax arbitrage. Some strategies are based on machine learning algorithms (such as artificial neural networks, Bayes, k-nearest neighbors). We also give: source code for illustrating out-of-sample backtesting with explanatory notes; around 2,000 bibliographic references; and over 900 glossary, acronym and math definitions. The presentation is intended to be descriptive and pedagogical. This is the complete version of the book",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,455276,public,self,Found this gem on SSRN Finance.

With the new year fast approaching, now is a great time to evaluate your portfolio, rebalance and set yourself up for a profitable 2020. Unlike 2019, when uncertainty took the market lower and offered investors plenty of bargain buys at the start of the year, this year’s market is trading near all-time highs. That makes stock picking difficult, especially as political uncertainty adds a layer of confusion in the year to come. 

It’s difficult, but not impossible, to find potential winners in 2020. While the market is near all-time highs, some sectors — like healthcare — have remained relatively untouched by the impressive rally. Investors should also be on the lookout for firms backed by solid financials in case a recession is on the horizon.

So I have been investing for half a year now and made $100 profit so far on a stock I firmly believe in because it has shown positive reports throughout the year (it’s in the biotechnology business). But I’ve been discussing with quite a few people about stocks that are worth “pennies”. This stock was worth 3SEK when I first invested which is less than a dollar and now it is worth 7SEK which is almost a dollar.

Following this trend, I will most likely see a positive trend in 2020 aswell with the stock increasing to about $2.

Anyways, some have said that penny stocks aren’t worth it. What is your opinion on this?

Kind regards,

Gabe

Specifically looking at stock OXY he bought this year.  Buffett bough $10 Billion worth of shares when the price was around $60 a share. Even if he received some type of discount it could be no where near the current price of $40 a share. 

With a 8% dividend it looks almost to good to be true. For all the reasons this thread could come up with on why OXY is not a good buy right now.(debt,oil stock, fracking, competition)   I get back to my original question.

Students in Wright State’s Raj Soin College of Business are given an opportunity to get real-world portfolio management experience through a semester-long course.

Through the course, Real Money, students are able to manage and invest in stocks with a university fund account.

According to Matt Ingram, WSU Board of Trustees in 2007 allocated $500,000 to the Raider Asset Management account.

“The students manage the portfolio, they make all of the decisions,” Ingram said. “They decide what to buy and what to sell. They can only work with the stocks and cash in the portfolio.”

The class size is typically less than 10 and students interested go through an application process. Ingram hopes to expand the class to more students in the future.

The fall 2019 semester had seven students managing the account.

“In other courses, you use theoretical dollars, but this course taught me a lot about how to value a company,” WSU senior Ben Inzitari said.

Students have helped the portfolio to flourish into a nearly $2 million fund. According to Ingram, that’s an average growth of 13% each year depending on the year.



“It’s a really great opportunity for students to learn about managing real money. They get to actually get their hands dirty doing research, picking stocks, figuring out what makes a good company, and what makes a good investment,” Ingram said.

The S&amp;P 500 index is the benchmark for all stock market investors, which are the prices of 500 of the companies in the United States.

“Over time only 25% of mutual fund managers can beat this benchmark in any form of consistent basis,” said Ingram. “And for the semester, our students beat the benchmark.”

The rate of return was greater than the S&amp;P 500, Wright State’s Raider Asset Management earned around 9.75% return while the S&amp;P was 8%.

“I think what’s interesting about this fund, it gives students a real-world experience while they are in college,” said Ingram. “They can see what portfolio managers actually do, because they become one.”

At the end of each semester the board of trustees, representatives of Foundation, and university finance are invited to a presentation about the account by the students.

“We couldn’t be prouder of how this is run, we have this award-winning trading room that they are working in and the Bloomberg Terminals they’re able to use for better analysis. The students end up with these really good skills,” said chair of department of finance and financial services, Marlena Akhbari

The trading room is located in the Soin Trading Center, which has a computer lab with a stock ticker tape that runs across the ceiling.

“Being able to participate in an actively managed fund has also reinforced many of the concepts that we have been taught here at Wright State as well; which was helpful when the answers were not always clear when we made decisions,” senior Shawn Greaf said.

Students that are involved in the class learn how to utilize tools such as Bloomberg, Ibbotson, and Baseline.

“It was beneficial to do the same type of work an equities analyst and portfolio manager would do on a daily basis; things like keeping up with market news, updating the other analysts on changes and consistently valuing companies trying to find good opportunities,” Greaf said.

During the summer, students who managed the account in prior semesters help monitor and manage the portfolio on a volunteer basis.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I currently work for a company (MMM) that allows me to buy company stock at a 15% discount. I have to hold it for over a year before I can sell it.


MMM hasn’t done well this year.... However, on a historic level the company has slowly gone up over time. If I were to buy the stock, hold it for a year and sell it. I could have a “guaranteed” 15% gain. (Not including the dividends or if the stock goes up.) 

For everyone in this sub who have a similar stock discount program at their work. Why would you not max out the percentage of your paycheck that one can use to purchase discount stocks? (Within Reason) 

Obviously, I know their is no such thing as “guaranteed” returns.   I can’t rationalize though that many other stock picks one could make would consistently have over a 15% gain in a given year.

However, would be curious to know everyone’s  thoughts and experiences.

$BHC   
Once in the $200s, this stock plummeted to $10 amid scrutiny and poor business practices.  And then a new CEO took over a few years ago, and it has climbed to $30.  They’ve shaved off a lot of debt, are now lead by someone who comes from a successful company, and have a few promising medicines available and on the way. The ceo has stated this is the first time they are able to attack and move forward, they’ve beaten the eps 4 quarters in a row, and I think $50 is not out of the question.    
  
$BP  
It’s okay to be sour based on the history of spills and unfortunate events, but BP will still be there in 2030, and the dividends are a bonus.  $38.11 might be a little high for me now, i’d like to see $35, but it should hold pretty reliably and could easily go over $50 in the future.

The dividends are great, an electric mustang is on the way, and our police force drives ford.  Electric police vehicles.  That may not happen, but if it does, current $9.45 is a deal to me.  I’m in on Ford for the next 15 years.   

$DEAC 
This will switch over to draft kings in the first half of 2020.  It’s $10.90 now.  If you google best sports betting app, draft kings is number 1.  I’ll take a $2 bump because i see $12 after the change, then I’ll sell quickly after.

I am starting my stock market investing journey very soon and wanted to share my overall thoughts and a few questions I had about what I learned before actually getting my feet wet investing stocks. I'll jump right into it:

I read over and over from many different sources that the vast majority of people (and CERTAINLY beginners) would do best to simply invest everything in the S&amp;P 500 and wait as long as possible instead of investing in individual stocks and trying to ""time the market"". But, well, to be honest, I have doubts about this advice... last year, the S&amp;P 500 had a return of about 35%... looking at a few stocks that are majorly popular and recommended by financial advisers (like Microsoft, AMD, Roku, Apple, Shopify, Mastercard, and so many others, you can literally just google ""best stocks"" to find them), their 2019 performance looks amazing! They had returns that absolutely crushed the S&amp;P 500's 35%! Most of them were over 100%... Investing in any one of those single stocks ALONE would have yielded substantially higher returns than the S&amp;P 500.

Here's my question: is me doubting this advice (that its best for noobs to invest in S&amp;P 500 rather than individual stocks) coming from a place of naivety? Is it actually in reality a LOT harder to ""beat the market"" then I think it is? Is what I am doing right now (cherry picking individual stocks that had great performance last year and then expecting they'll have great performance next year) a recipe for disaster? Would I do best to simply invest everything in the S&amp;P 500 like everyone is saying, even though I feel like I can do so much better with those few stocks mentioned above?

Most of my stock decisions are made with the potential growth and future of the company/idea in mind. For instance, I invest in CRISPR companies because i think in the future, it’ll be very resourceful and useful. I also look toward improving the world or developing something new.

I specifically enjoy mostly science related stocks or stocks that try to benefit the world.

I have been looking to invest now because I usually spend so much time waiting for a good dip that I miss many opportunities. I have been thinking on investing in AMD and Enphase. Are these two good ideas now? They’re both pretty high, especially AMD.

What companies on your radar would satisfy the requirements of Peter Thiel's book Zero to One.

Basically this comes down to companies the following 3 items:

* Companies betting on a contrarian truth
* Companies that begin by trying to dominate a narrow market, but have the potential to expand outward into adjacent markets.
* Companies that have the potential to become a monopoly.

Contrarian Truths might be:

* People are willing to let strangers drive them around (Uber)
* People will give up most of their tv options for being able to binge watch and not have ads (Netflix)

Companies who started by dominating a narrow market:

* Amazon with Books
* Google with search engine

All of these companies have the opportunity to become monopolies due to:

* Brand (fashionable technology such as Apple.)
* Proprietary Technology (google is a better search engine and that technology is patented)
* Network (you use facebook because most of your friends are already there)
* Economies of Scale (amazon can destroy most people in shipping because their operating cost is lower per item)

I hope this is the right place for a post like this. Otherwise maybe you can point me in another direction? 

I’ve been learning about the stock market for a good few months now, reading a lot online, doing a couple online courses and watching a lot of YouTube content on the matter. I’ve also done a little paper trading, but I’ve found it hard to “act” like it’s the real deal, since I had nothing to lose. However, I do feel confident in the different buying/selling mechanisms (market order, limit order and so on). I’ve also been following up on the news regarding the financial market, trying to make sense of it all, and relate it to different stocks I’ve been following. 
So I generally feel fairly confident in my knowledge, but at the same time, I feel like I need a lot more experience.. (I promise this is going somewhere!) before I can properly begin investing. 

The thing is, besides paper trading, the only real way to get some experience is to actually started.. 

But every time I think today is the day, I get a little hesitant, and get the feeling that maybe today is not the right day, because the market is X or Y. Maybe a better day will come? 

I know that you cannot time the market (at least few do it with success), and something will always be up. We currently have the China Trade War, the rallies in Hong Kong, Brexit and so on. We also have the rates acted all weird, and the FED’s considering to change them (this is “settled” now ofc.). 

I even have an account set up, all I need is to transfer the money to the account and start buying. 

All in all I believe the issue I keep having this feeling I missed something in the news, or some stat that would have told me the trade was a bad idea? 

Also, I know I should not invest money I can’t afford to lose. And I can afford to lose the money I have sat aside, but that doesn’t mean I want to, obviously. 

How did you get into investing?

“This is a major milestone for Asterion as it prepares to commence work on its industry leading medicinal cannabis cultivation and processing facility near Toowoomba in South East Queensland, Australia” (the “**Toowoomba Facility**”) stated Mr. Stephen Van Deventer, Asterion’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  “Asterion is delighted that it has passed through the ODC’s rigorous assessment process and been awarded the licences it requires to establish its flagship project.  The ODC approvals represent a major step for Asterion towards the manufacturing of pharmaceutical-grade medicinal cannabis at our planned 75 ha (185 acre) Toowoomba Facility.”  


Stephen Van Deventer, further stated, “Asterion intends to commence work on the Toowoomba Facility in the first quarter of 2020 and is expected to commence cultivation of its first crop in 2022. On completion, the Toowoomba Facility is expected to employ more than 1,000 people harvesting more than 20,000 plants a day, and to generate an estimated AUD $2 billion annually in exports, while also supplying medicinal cannabis to the Australian market.  Asterion is committed to its program of innovation across the supply chain, with the goal furthering the development of medicinal cannabis–based pharmaceuticals to provide a safe and effective treatment for a variety of medical conditions.”  
 

The Licences authorize Asterion Australia to cultivate cannabis plants and process them into a range of medicinal cannabis products, including natural dried cannabis flower, (across a variety of strains, aimed at specific medical conditions) as well as gel capsules, oils and soluble gels.

For the past couple of years I have been dabbling in stocks a bit. Nothing too crazy, currently I have about $3,000 in (spread among-st V, MSFT, HEXO, and DIS). 

I just got a new job that is going to be a rather large salary increase and would like to commit more of my disposable income into market. 

I am wondering what other stocks (apart from what I am committed to right now) would be the safest long term stock options. Or would it be best to continue riding the big three I currently have V, MSFT, and DIS and just buy in more? 

I would be looking to cash out in the next 8 - 10 years.

I am starting my venture into buying and selling stocks. I am brand new to investing in general.

After browsing around for a few hours and looking at a bunch of different stocks, one thing I quickly realized I desired was a way to sort ALL of the available stocks on the stock market according to various metrics. These metrics may be things such as:

\- Volatility within a specific frame of time (being able to show the stocks that have had the most volatility in the past day, for example)

\- Growth over a specific time frame (being able to show the stocks that have grown most over the past year, for example)

\- Stocks within a certain price (being able to show stocks priced within $100 and $200, for example)

Does anyone know any tool that can do this? This seems very basic to me and I imagine that it must exist somewhere.

Macy’s and Fedex both reported bleak results but the mood was improved when **Micron ($MU)** posted solid first quarter results on Wednesday, delivering good profitability and positive free cash flow. The numbers were down, year on year, but CEO Sanjay Mehrotra called it the ""cyclical bottom"" and went on to say “Our significantly improved competitive position, dramatically stronger product portfolio, structurally higher profitability and investment-grade balance sheet position Micron very well to drive long-term shareholder value”.   Micron is currently valued at just under 18x trailing earnings.  If this is the cyclical bottom, then that looks very attractive.


**Growth stocks (SmileDirectClub and The RealReal)**

**SmileDirectClub ($SDC)**, the online start up disrupting the orthodontic industry, jumped 10% after reporting that 21 out of 22 class action plaintiffs ""have voluntarily withdrawn their claims"" against the company.  

(Please be aware that this is a HIGH RISK highly speculative stock.)

But to understand the value of the company you must balance the huge potential opportunity that faces SmileDirectClub against the pending legislation that still could impose harsher regulations on online dentistry companies.
It is estimated that there are 124 million potential orthodontic customers in the U.S. and half a billion worldwide. That's a total addressable market of $245 billion in the U.S. and $700 billion in the rest of the world. That is a global TAM of $945 billion compared to SmileDirectClub's current market cap of $3.1 billion.
The outcome of litigation processes remains extremely difficult to call. However the report this week suggests the balance of risk and reward has shifted in favour of SDC. 


**The RealReal ($REAL)** got a boost this week from Susan Anderson at B. Riley who said that the company is the ""the leader in the modern-day luxury consignment market whose model is disrupting traditional consignment shops""

The RealReal offers a marketplace for luxury items that has resonated with younger customers who see the value opportunity of owning luxury goods for just a short time while also appreciating the ethical aspects of recycling.

The company reported strong results last month with sales up 55% but the stock price was hit by a CNBC report on negative customer reviews and counterfeit merchandise.  The stock is still down 19% with a market capitalization of $1.6 billion.

That valuation (5.5x sales) looks cheap compared to growth and outlook. The company has responded to claims of fake merchandise.  Its processes are industry leading and, at the end of the day, it offers a guarantee for authenticity so customers should be reassured.

However the bottom line for me is that the total addressable market for luxury goods in the US is massive at $198 billion. That means the risk return still looks favourable with RealReal in the early stages of growth. The potential downside is (as always) 100% but that compares to huge potential upside given the current gross merchandise volume of just $1 billion.

It is encouraging to see analysts at B. Riley seem to agree.


**Value Stocks (Skechers)**

Skechers also got a boost after Deutsche Bank joined Barron’s and Argus in backing the stock.  Skechers' brands have also been resonating with influencers and key opinion leaders globally even if it has failed so far to resonate with investors. 

In some ways the brand lacks the macho appeal of Nike and Under Armour.  However, Skechers has grown over the past 20 years to become the third-largest global footwear brand by revenue, after Nike and Adidas. 

Analysts estimate Skechers’ to post earnings growth on pace with Nike Nike trades at about 38 times earnings compared with 20 times for Sketchers.

A discount is appropriate but 50% off looks attractive. 


**Pharma (Axsome)**

**Axsome's ($AXSM)** new clinical drug the blockbuster, AXS-05, has reported significant improvements in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  47% of patients with MDD achieve complete remission, as opposed to the 16% of patients taking the placebo.
Depression treatments are one of the largest healthcare markets in the U.S., with around 7.1% of adults -- or 17.3 million -- Americans affected each year.  Estimated at USD 15.60 Billion in 2018.

And there's not a lot of competition.

Axsome's stock has surged by almost 4,000% since the beginning of 2019, pushing the stock from a $93 million market cap into the $3.5 billion range. But it could have further upside potential due to AXS-05's success, little competition and the large addressable market.

**Insider Buying (IIPR)**
**Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. ($IIPR)** CEO continues to snap up stock, another $140,000 this week.

IIPR is a cannabis REIT acquiring and leasing medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities. That’s lucrative because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level.  Its weighted-average lease length is 15.5 years, with an average return on invested capital of 13.6%. In other words, Innovative Industrial Properties will see a complete payback on its investments in a little over five years, but should have steady and predictable cash flow for more than a decade.


Finally, Barron's recent ”Best Stocks of the Decade” article has some predictable names in there along with **United Rentals ($URI)** which is perhaps more of a surprise for some.  Personally I've liked URI for a long time. It's a market leader with economies of scale (network effects) but its overall market share remains low (about 13%) and the economic benefits to customers of switching from ownership to rental (less idle time, better range of appliance, lower cost, no debt on balance sheet etc) should drive growth for years to come. Despite this the stock still has a TTM PE of just 11.6.  Hard to justify a valuation so low.

- https://gca.org/global-commission-on-adaptation/report

Its primary aim is to put climate change adaptation on to the political agenda around the world. And to do this, it sets out ""concrete solutions"" and an economic plan.

There are, it says, five things the world should invest in over the next decade:

Warning systems: For the vulnerable island and coastal communities in particular, early warnings about storms, very high tides and other extreme weather can save lives. Better weather monitoring and a simple app for fishing communities in the Cook Islands, for example, allows them to plan according to the sea conditions

Infrastructure: Building better roads, buildings and bridges to suit the changing climate. One project in New York City has set out to paint rooftops white - a heat-reflecting strategy to cool buildings and neighbourhoods

Improving dryland agriculture: Something as simple as helping farmers to switch to more drought-resistant varieties of coffee crop could protect livelihoods and prevent hunger

Restoring and protecting mangroves: Underwater mangrove forests protect about 18 million people from coastal flooding, but they're being wiped out by development. Restoration projects could protect vulnerable communities from storms and boost fisheries' productivityWater: Protecting water supplies - and making sure that water's not being wasted - will be vital in a changing climate

Each of these investments, the commission says, would contribute to what they call a ""triple dividend""- avoiding future losses, generating positive economic gains through innovation, and delivering social and environmental benefits. It is that dividend that the report has valued at $7.1tn (£5.7tn).

**""Think of the fortunes made during the Industrial Revolution – fortunes that exist even to the present day. Think of the fortunes made during the recent China boom.

"" Of all the stocks I covered this year, I was hardest on Uber (UBER). I caught some flak for writing “[buying Uber stock is the dumbest thing you can do with your money in 2019](https://riskhedge.com/go/lrjmq7xz/for).”

Although my call ruffled feathers, I stand by it. Since Uber IPO’d in May, the stock has plunged 35%. And it was just plain wrong how the media hyped up its IPO, luring in novice investors who didn’t know any better, only to watch their money go up in smoke. 

To be clear, I love Uber’s service. It’s cheap, easy, and way better than regular taxis. But it’s been a horrible, money-losing business.

The fares it charges aren’t nearly enough to cover its expenses. In the first six months of this year, it blew through over $6 billion!""

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2) in general, what is happening to WCG shareholders?  Do we get a cash buyout or something?

First, Tesla now has a $2,000 software upgrade that can reduce the 0-60 time by 0.5 seconds for the dual-motor long-range version of Model 3. Since there's no incremental cost for Tesla to provide the upgrade as it is done remotely, this is pure margin. Assuming dual-motor represents 30-35% of the Model 3 base and 10% of the owners choose to upgrade, that would add $25-30m of EBIT, which is not immaterial (last quarter's EBIT was $260m). Second, the residual values for the Model S and Model X are much higher than other EVs in China, according to China's dealer association. 3-year old models are fetching 60-70% of their initial price, compared to 25-35% for mosts Chinese EVs and the next best performing EV BMW X5 plug-in hybrid retains 50% after 3 years.

This comes just as supply of ad units are expected to decline due to rapid adoption of new OTT streaming services with no ad loads, which means ad units will likely see unprecedented pricing power in 2020.

2) TTD is pure play exposure to digital advertising, the fastest growing part of the sector. Also, ad spend is closely tied to the economy, which typically does well in a year when a president can be re-elected.

3) US digital ad revenue is expected to reach $150B in 2020, with $FB, $GOOGL, and $AMZN taking $105B of that pie. With rising regulatory scrutiny at these giants, TTD should benefit as the biggest buyer of ads in the remaining $45B of the open internet.

And with the stock getting above $0.30 for the first time since in three months, it’s clear that investors liked the headlines.

On November 25, Halo announced plans to purchase Mendo Distribution and Transportation, a cannabis distributor in Northern California. The company will pay for the $4.75 million acquisition using stock, allowing it to preserve its strong cash position. Through the deal, Halo will reduce distribution costs while extending its distribution capabilities.

The company also announced its acquisition of South African company Bophelo Bioscience &amp; Wellness, which was in exchange for over 40 million shares of Halo stock. Bophelo currently leases a five-hectare, fully licensed greenhouse, but it plans to expand to an additional 200 hectares (nearly 500 acres), which would make the site one of the largest cultivations in the world. The first full harvest of approximately 1,000 cannabis plants is expected in the second quarter of 2020.

News of the latest – but certainly not the last – partnership agreement broke on December 8. Oregon-based DNA Genetics will exclusively develop Halo’s seed genetics through breeding, phenotyping, and growing. The initial length of the deal is five years. DNA Generics boasts an impressive resume, having garnered more than 180 awards in the industry, including High Times’ top 10 strain of the year. This is huge news and will continue propelling Halo forward.

Halo Labs looks strong heading into the new year. The company recently reported revenue of $25.4 million for the first nine months of 2019 – a 223% increase from the same period last year. The cannabis market is maturing fast, and Halo Labs sits in a fantastic position to prosper. ",True,False,[],False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,452058,public,self,Halo labs (AGEEF),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/eckxv7/halo_labs_ageef/,all_ads,6,,,,resources,a376614c-65e6-11e5-b6e7-123c7cc7e97b,Resources,,,,,,,,

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (BA.N) decision to stop production of its best-selling 737 MAX aircraft involved in two fatal crashes will impact U.S. economic growth and employment, but the pain may be brief and concentrated in areas where suppliers are located, analysts and executives say.

The biggest assembly-line halt in more than two decades at Boeing could cut first quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a percentage point, economists estimated on Tuesday. The hit to GDP growth would come from a smaller inventory build.

I'm about to start my own small business as a sleep coach/consultant. Basically, I’m going to help night shift workers achieve good quality sleep within 6 weeks - without sacrificing time with their loved ones and their favorite day time activities. Of course, my method also works for day shift workers, so don't worry if you're not a night shift worker.

But before getting serious about it, I’d like to find one or two more test clients to really perfect my system. I won’t be asking for much but constructive feedback or recommendations.

I am currently using Fidelity, but I'm looking to see if there's anything better.

The problem I have is how Fidelity lumps all of the stocks into one group. I don't have the ability to view the progress of a group of stocks. Just my whole account.

This is problematic for a few reasons. For one thing, if I short sell some stocks, they get displayed the same as if I were to buy a stock. If the stock goes down in value, it appears red with the minus percentage. This minus amount gets added to the rest of the percentage of the stocks I bought, so the total percentage does not give me an accurate perspective of whether or not my account is doing well as a whole.

Some of my stocks are chosen using a different strategy than other stocks. I would like to be able to see reports on groups of stocks, to be able to compare and see which strategy is working better than another strategy.

The only way I can see how to do that in fidelity is to open a separate account, and view reports for each account separately. But that would mean the account has a separate bank connections / separate access permissions. I would actually need to ""transfer"" money from one account to another. I would prefer to have something much more lightweight, where I simply have multiple grouping of stocks within the same account, for reporting purposes.

Finally, in Fidelity I only get good report information on a per month basis. The daily information is frequently inaccurate.
