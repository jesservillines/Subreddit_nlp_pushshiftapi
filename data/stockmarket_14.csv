Overall the company has a solid economic moat with its innovative adhesive solutions and brand awareness. Its market dominance is also near-monopolistic in Fevicol and M seal brands which contributes a major portion of the revenue.  
&gt;  
&gt; ***The business model is such that 56% of the revenue comes from adhesives and sealants, 20% from construction and paint chemicals, 8% from arts and crafts materials, 6% from pigments and the rest from Industrial adhesives and resins.*** This has helped the company to diversify its product portfolio and achieve sustainable growth in revenue.

Chinese companies are developing and producing more higher valued goods, even as companies are moving production out of the country due its trade war with the U.S. and the coronavirus pandemic, an expert said on Thursday.  


""We are actually seeing this movement from manufacturing in China to other locations, but also China then investing in technology,"" said Patrick Winter, Asia Pacific managing partner at Ernst and Young.  


""We are seeing a lot of manufacturing now moving into other locations - toys and cameras are going to Mexico; personal computers, we're seeing those go offshore from mainland into Taiwan. Other manufacturing automotive manufacturing down into to Thailand, Vietnam, and India and so, we're seeing manufacturing move out of China,"" he said.  


Even though some of these factory activities are moving out of the mainland, China is moving up the value chain through its huge investments in technology, artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain - in turn developing and producing higher valued goods, Winter told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" There are ""a lot of investment into technology which would actually move China to a different spot within the supply chain,"" he added.

My name is Joe Montaño and I would like to share a personal stock market tool turned website I've been developing for a couple years.

[StockHacks.jolomo.io](https://StockHacks.jolomo.io)

Don't worry the domain is temporary while in beta...

Our systems build machine learning models that predict future closing prices. These models (which are in their simplest form for now) use a combination of typical data you would expect and also considered many technical indicators. 

Additionally we have some news headlines load for you to read to get an overview of the companies current events.Here soon we will also incorporate news sentiment analysis to the model building parameters.

The newest feature that is about ready is the mock trading system. So if your new to investing you can practice and track your hypothetical returns!

Anyways would love some feedback/testers to register and poke around. Things aren't perfect yet but that's where you come in!

Thanks ahead of time,

I always thought dividend stocks were BS, because why get 5%/year in dividends if the sp500 average is 7%/year.

But now that I'm thinking about, I think its better.

Here is my theory (please tell me if I'm right):

Lets say stock A costs $100 and pays $5 dividend.

Stock A goes down to $50, and it still pays the $5 dividend right? So basically you will get a 10% dividend yield stock.

I am currently looking at stocks like Exxon, which is currently at  8.30%.

If my theory is correct, that the best I can do, is find dividend stocks that are really really cheap at the moment.

I know that companies might choose not to pay dividends for a year or two but that's ok. My time horizon is 30 years.

Delta and Southwest in particular have been hot commodities to trade as of late (prior to Warren Buffet giving them the kiss of death). I myself held some Delta for a minute before selling off the moment it showed any pulse. I didn't want any part of the industry after listening to earnings calls and 3-5 year projections. However, I found myself tuning in to Allegiant Air's earnings call yesterday and am now slightly intrigued. What got my attention was the $2.05 Actual EPS compared to the $0.90 Expected EPS. So I dialed in. I came away impressed by the follow:

-**bold**Allegiant thrives on being bargain shoppers.**bold**
Other airlines folding and putting their used aircraft on sale would present a great opportunity for Allegiant.

-**bold**Leisure travel is the first to recover over Business &amp; International.**bold**
Allegiant focuses on mostly transporting customers from less serviceable regions to vacation hotspots. Low cost airfare also is a major plus for the consumer during hard times. The latter part of April has already seen an uptick in bookings.

-**bold**Less routes to maintain than larger competitors.**bold**
With cost savings the name of the game right now only the airlines with the best balance sheet and overall finances will weather the storm. Many of the larger carriers are sometimes flying empty jets to be able to keep their routes. Allegiant, on the other hand, does not have as many routes and also utilizes routes that have less competition.

-**bold**Vegas will be opening up soon.**bold**
Allegiant has a large presence in the Sin City. With casinos expected to open back up as early as June, this presents an opportunity for the airline to cash in. Also, the Las Vegas Raiders will debut their brand new Allegiant Stadium once the NFL season kicks off. The airline's name recognition should go through the roof with this exposure.

All in all, with the stock price being down 57% YTD coupled with the financials and business model to claw themselves back to the top, wouldn't Allegiant Air be the best bet to reach their pre COVID-19 levels before the larger carriers?",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,411321,public,confidence,self,How About the 9th Largest Airline in America Instead?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gjfjwk/how_about_the_9th_largest_airline_in_america/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the growth of this sub we are seeing an influx of spam, self promotion and pump and dump posts. To be clear, going forward, people who do any of the following or anything similar to them will be immediately and permanently banned:

- Promote your own YouTube channel/videos or your social media accounts (Twitter/Instagram/etc)
- Share your Webull/Robinhood/Amazon/whatever referral or affiliate links
- Promote your own Discord chat (or any chat for that matter)
- Attempt to sell your trading course/service
- Crosspost to/from your own sub to direct traffic to it
- Post links to your own blog posts/websites/etc
- Try to get people to follow your ""hot trading alerts"" and other such nonsense
- Promote low volume/otc/pinksheet companies that could potentially be pump and dumps
- Basically anything similar to any of these intended to exploit the growth of our sub for personal gain (and yes we know all the tricks)

We've added two new report reasons so you can report posts that violate these rules: 

* **Self Promotion:** This includes discord links (other than the official /r/StockMarket discord), subreddits (including crossposting to/from your own sub), personal websites, trading courses/services/chat rooms, youtube channels, social media, etc.

* **Possible Pump &amp; Dump:** Includes spammy/scammy posts (particularly promotional ones) about low-volume and OTC/pinksheet companies that may be intended to influence stock prices or manipulate the market

----- 
The intention here is not to censor the sub but rather to improve its content as a whole. If you see posts like the above, please report them as it really helps us out in keeping it under control. 

We've also revamped the sidebar/about section a bit to reflect these rules, and updated various links over there. We'll be adding some additional automod rules soon too which will also help keep content under control.

A good thought experiment is: what product or service is currently unviable, but becomes workable with the new technology.

For example:
- Video on demand was crap until faster internet
- Out of town real estate was valueless until the motor car
- outsourcing jobs overseas needed cheaper and better telephone connections. Yey.

The obvious next leap is 5G, but I struggle to see what ideas this will make viable. Can you think of anything that would be awesome, but fails because we need faster internet?

Another one, and more interesting, is Starlink. Having massively better internet in remote locations should be a giant leap. But what industries will this change?

We can't invest in SpaceX, but it's early enough to get in on some peripheral idea that suddenly becomes viable and makes a good return out of nowhere.

**TL;DR:** The relatively clean safety sheet overall coupled with our expectation that the higher dose groups will be enriched for the complete responders once we get a deeper look on 5/29 has us confident that Allogene is triangulating on a relatively safe, highly efficacious dose to take forward into further development.

The ASCO abstracts including  Allogene's ALPHA trial abstract have been released. All in all the abstract supports our thesis for Allogene that we walked through in our recent write up, though we will need to wait for the 5/29 presentation for a more detailed look at the data. Key takeaways from the abstract include: 

1) No dose-limiting toxicities or GvHD observed: this is great news 

2) Only 2 (22.2%) of patients developed Grade 1 - 2 CRS, which resolved within 72 hours 

3) 78% ORR, including 3 complete responses.

AAPL has recovered incredibly quickly and was briefly back at all time high yesterday ($320). Going forward, if more bad than good news come, it has a long way to fall (it hit $224 on March 23). If more good than bad news come, realistically it only has a minor potential climb in the near future. 

LUV is probably somewhere close to bottom. It’s been falling steadily for the past month but similar, slightly riskier stocks like DAL have been relatively flat for a while now and LUV will be too as it finds its way to the bottom. It’s taken a little longer for LUV to fall because Southwest is a healthier company than Delta, financially. Going forward, if more bad than good news come, LUV won’t fall much further. If more good than bad news come, it can climb very high.

Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Yes, you can argue the Feds can manipulate the value of USD by playing with interest rates and pump and dump the market at will. BUT, they can't control the price of gold against worldwide currencies. So I figured the value of S&amp;P in terms of ounces of gold may be a great way to judge where the market is at right now and give me an insight otherwise not possible to see. 

So after Google'ing the concept, I found out that this is actually a way to measure market performance and very commonly used. I was not the one who came up with the idea first, haha.

So anyway, currently we are sitting at 1.68x ratio (1.68 ounces of gold equals S&amp;P500 value)/

* The high point was **Aug 2000 at 5.53x**. That signalled overheated market which actually started coming down less than a year later. 

&amp;#x200B;

* The low point was **Aug 2011 at 0.67x**. That signalled the low of the real estate market actually.

&amp;#x200B;

* The most recent high was **Aug 2018 at 2.40x**.

&amp;#x200B;

* Currently, **May 2020, it is at 1.68x**

Let me know what you think!

Is $VTIQ blowing up because of *Tesla Fanboy Culture*? Let\'s take a look at hydrogen (H2) technology. H2 technology is still in R&amp;D stages, with mid-grade technical readiness level (TRL). The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) heavily focuses on bolstering the TRL of H2, but I believe there is a long way to go until there are H2 fueling stations around the country to use. See source 1 below.  Another level of complexity to consider for TRL of H2 fueling stations is H2 legislation. To my understanding, California is one of the few states that recognize H2 as a potable future fuel option alternative to fossil fuels. See source 2 below. The real issue as I see it, is how individual states recognize concentrated H2 in its gaseous form. California see\'s it as a novel fuel source where only H2O is the by product. However, many other states see it as a potential hazard, given it\'s energy-dense nature. I\'m assuming big oil companies and lobbyists play a part here, where it starts to get hand wavy.\n\nSource 1:  [https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2020/nrel-research-fueling-big-rigs-help-hydrogen-vehicles-hit-road.html](https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2020/nrel-research-fueling-big-rigs-help-hydrogen-vehicles-hit-road.html) \n\nSource 2:  [https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/fact-month-18-01-january-29-there-are-39-publicly-available-hydrogen-fueling-stations](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/fact-month-18-01-january-29-there-are-39-publicly-available-hydrogen-fueling-stations) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I personally believe it\'s a great potential ""Tesla-like esque"" company to be a part of in these early stages, however H2 industry presents some challenges as mentioned above. The part that gives me confidence, is that Nikola Motors does not simply rely on H2 technology, but also create semitrucks that use electric batteries, which we all know is a novel and promising technology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, I would love to hear your opinions and considerations.

Nikola Motors already have &amp;quot;14,000  pre-orders&amp;quot; for their trucks, averaging at about $10 billion in potential revenue for the next 2.5 years of production.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;source:  &lt;a href=""https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-a-global-leader-in-zero-emissions-transportation-solutions-to-be-listed-on-nasdaq-through-a-merger-with-vectoiq-74""&gt;https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-a-global-leader-in-zero-emissions-transportation-solutions-to-be-listed-on-nasdaq-through-a-merger-with-vectoiq-74&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now for some healthy skepticism. Is $VTIQ blowing up because of &lt;em&gt;Tesla Fanboy Culture&lt;/em&gt;? Let&amp;#39;s take a look at hydrogen (H2) technology. H2 technology is still in R&amp;amp;D stages, with mid-grade technical readiness level (TRL). The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) heavily focuses on bolstering the TRL of H2, but I believe there is a long way to go until there are H2 fueling stations around the country to use. See source 1 below.  Another level of complexity to consider for TRL of H2 fueling stations is H2 legislation. To my understanding, California is one of the few states that recognize H2 as a potable future fuel option alternative to fossil fuels. See source 2 below. The real issue as I see it, is how individual states recognize concentrated H2 in its gaseous form. California see&amp;#39;s it as a novel fuel source where only H2O is the by product. However, many other states see it as a potential hazard, given it&amp;#39;s energy-dense nature. I&amp;#39;m assuming big oil companies and lobbyists play a part here, where it starts to get hand wavy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source 1:  &lt;a href=""https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2020/nrel-research-fueling-big-rigs-help-hydrogen-vehicles-hit-road.html""&gt;https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2020/nrel-research-fueling-big-rigs-help-hydrogen-vehicles-hit-road.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source 2:  &lt;a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/fact-month-18-01-january-29-there-are-39-publicly-available-hydrogen-fueling-stations""&gt;https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/fact-month-18-01-january-29-there-are-39-publicly-available-hydrogen-fueling-stations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I personally believe it&amp;#39;s a great potential &amp;quot;Tesla-like esque&amp;quot; company to be a part of in these early stages, however H2 industry presents some challenges as mentioned above. The part that gives me confidence, is that Nikola Motors does not simply rely on H2 technology, but also create semitrucks that use electric batteries, which we all know is a novel and promising technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please, I would love to hear your opinions and considerations.

Stocks cut gains from the pre-market session and opened lower Wednesday, as traders eyed commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

In his comments, Powell undercut hopes of a quick V-shaped recovery for the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus pandemic, [saying that a deep, long downturn could](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserve-chairman-powell-us-economy-faces-longer-term-concerns-130001781.html) “leave behind lasting damage” to economic productivity.

“The recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems,” Powell said during his webcast appearance with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, according to prepared remarks.

Powell also reiterated that the central bank would use all of its monetary policy tools “until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,” and suggested that Congress boost fiscal stimulus to mitigate the risk of longer-term economic damage.

The remarks reiterated sentiments previously expressed by other Fed officials, many of whom acknowledged that the extended shutdowns that have helped bring down new case growth for the virus have simultaneously come at the expense of economic and business activity. A number of Federal Reserve officials who delivered public remarks on issued more cautious commentary around the coronavirus’s near- and long-term impacts on the U.S. economy and financial markets.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voter in this year’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), [said Tuesday](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20200512-an-update-on-the-economy-and-the-federal-reserves-policy-response.aspx) she expected unemployment to hit or top 20% domestically, and for second-quarter annualized GDP growth to be negative by as much as 40%, before a gradual economic recovery kicks off in the second half of the year.

And during a webcast Tuesday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard [said widespread shelter](https://www.omfif.org/events/the-federal-reserves-outlook-for-testing-times/) in place orders could not go on indefinitely, saying, “You’ll get too many business failures and you’ll really do lasting damage.”

Earlier, on Tuesday, the three major U.S. equity indices ended with their largest one-day declines in seven sessions, as market participants grew wary of some states’ reopening processes, and considered other major metropolitan areas’ extended stay in place orders. Los Angeles County will likely remain under distancing orders through July, [officials said Tuesday](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-12/coronavirus-beaches-reopen-los-angeles-county-move-toward-new-normal). And New York City residents are likely to remain under stay in place orders through at least June, Mayor Bill De Blasio said earlier this week.

But other states and counties are already in the midst of – or will soon begin – a phased reopening process. During a congressional testimony Tuesday, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, [warned of consequences that](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-update-fauci-warns-on-reopening-risks-says-outbreak-not-under-control-175829447.html) “could be serious” if parts of the country open before the pandemic is adequately contained.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,410627,public,confidence,self,Market Tumbles After Powell Warns Of 'Lasting Damage' Due To Coronavirus Earlier,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gizmsx/market_tumbles_after_powell_warns_of_lasting/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'CPCANYrd-Ks6LpE_N7Sf_6UPlpq6e72ZG5pX7wkFnUg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-Hom_qmvKIkjrhZnIF063retVRgv-e76VGi4gEKgmgE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5845a914e5b963ca164e27009145aeaa872467c9', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-Hom_qmvKIkjrhZnIF063retVRgv-e76VGi4gEKgmgE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57ac07c25fe937d1e2fe42b3ca66c9461f912bc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-Hom_qmvKIkjrhZnIF063retVRgv-e76VGi4gEKgmgE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b04881c518dce9ba8548d0e57cd2dc052c394922', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-Hom_qmvKIkjrhZnIF063retVRgv-e76VGi4gEKgmgE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc531d195d9a4149bef67a87670d6cea542e525f', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-Hom_qmvKIkjrhZnIF063retVRgv-e76VGi4gEKgmgE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=034734eed96c3d79423beb02ac4709e912c8fbe1', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-Hom_qmvKIkjrhZnIF063retVRgv-e76VGi4gEKgmgE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1981b7292e820ef34434f944d8370a42dbe612f2', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 3648, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-Hom_qmvKIkjrhZnIF063retVRgv-e76VGi4gEKgmgE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ca248b5f302be221d7f490063e5aaaf7d0782c2f', 'width': 5472}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are led by a genius who has already beat Tesla once in a lawsuit over multiple patents and the numbers seem to point to an upwards trend.**

Okay boys and girls I am back and here to talk about Tesla’s ballbuster, VTIQ, or VectoIQ Acquisition. So you may be asking what this company is and let me give you a quick gist, VectoIQ is a holding company led by former **General Motors** vice chairman Steve Girsky. It has no real business of its own, but it has drawn a *lot* of interest from auto investors lately because of its plan to merge with Nikola Motors. VectoIQ's stock has had an especially strong run in the last few sessions, after the company confirmed in a series of regulatory filings that the merger is on track to close in early June. 

Now lets go over some fundamentals of this company and its soon ally Nikola Motors. First of all this company is led by Steve Girsky. Girsky joined the board of GM in July 2009 as the company emerged from a U.S. and Canadian taxpayer bailout and bankruptcy. He was a key advisor to GM’s chief executives since before the 2009 bankruptcy. Girsky led restructuring efforts at Opel, GM’s primary brand in Europe, and pushed GM executives to embrace investments in digital technology and mobile internet connectivity that the company has now made central to its product strategy. In addition to being a board member, Girsky was GM vice chairman from March 2010 to January 2014, heading up GM’s global strategy during that time. He was the chairman of the Adam Opel AG supervisory board as GM struggled to bring Opel back to profitability at a time when some of his former counterparts on Wall Street thought GM should try to sell the brand. So basically this guy knows how to lead a company and more so assist a company in developing a brand and establishing a foundation even in the most troubled of times.

Now let's get into which companies hold VTIQ and can help in pushing this company higher. We have BlackRock with 2.2 million shares and Karpus with 2.3 million shares along with 37 other investment firms trying to enjoy the ride with VTIQ too, including a retirement fund too. Now the retirement fund is interesting since 95% of the time these funds try to go with safe investments because it is for the long run, so them investing in something like this means they know how little the downside is.

Now Nikola Motors is poised to be going into a brawl with the great all knowing Elon Musk, but thing is they have already won round one. Almost two years ago, Nikola Motors surprised the trucking market by filing a $2 billion lawsuit alleging that the Tesla Semi copied several design elements from the Nikola One, the truck-maker’s flagship hydrogen long hauler. News about the patent lawsuit has been scarce for over a year, but recent updates indicate that Nikola has snatched a small victory from the Silicon Valley-based electric car maker. Nikola’s case listed several characteristics of the One that were allegedly copied by Tesla. These included the Semi’s wraparound windshield, mid-entry door, front fenders, and the all-electric truck’s aerodynamic shape. To highlight its point, Nikola stated that the similar drag coefficient between the One (0.37) and the Semi (0.36) was further proof that the battery electric long hauler was copied from the hydrogen fuel-cell sleeper cab. 

Excerpts from Nikola’s lawsuit pointed out that the Semi’s design had caused confusion among the One’s customers, diverting sales from the hydrogen truck maker to Tesla. Nikola also argued that these confusions might result in the Semi’s problems being attributed to the One, such as those resulting from Tesla’s batteries and Autopilot software.

Well here was the ruling on that: **Tesla loses bid to invalidate Nikola Motor patents in USPTO dispute. USPTO not only upheld Nikola semi truck's important patents but refused Tesla's request to modify our patents. Two billion dollar lawsuit moving forward. We will defend our company's IP no matter who it is.**

And last but not least let's get into the numbers. VTIQ has moved up significantly in the past month and is seeming to not be slowing down in any sense. With the MACD set to a 2.1 and 1.0 difference with the RSI being still lower than their previous March jump, they seem to have a huge jump left to be had. As of recently they had a 13 million volume which is still 5 million less than their highest volume level of 18 million so it seems like there is a lot of money left to be made.

Always have your targets and stops calculated before placing trades in order to manage risk and eliminate large losses. No need to give up weeks worth of profits in a matter of days.

I wanna tell you about my expierence with the stock market and ask you a question!

I am 19 y/o since 2 days ago. I thought about trading since I became 18 and made my first trade on 3. January.   


I dont do Daytrading only classic investing. I invested in severell different stocks(Tesla, Paypal, Apple, and a lot of smaller ones, Veritone etc.)

I read some stuff about the stock market and was interested in it for a long time. 

But my generell understanding of it as of now is. 

1. The stock market is unpredictable.
2. Buy low sell high.
3. Time in the market is better than timing the market.

I also know a lot about support lines and chart analysis. But tbh I had the most success when I stuck to my plan/ would have done that and not sell instantly when something bad happens.

If it werent for the stock market crash I think I would have made like 100% return from a 5k investment in 3 months. I am down 300 bucks from my original invest so sitting at 4700€ and  as of now I havent invested realy anything. I only sold my Veritone stocks. 

I wanna talk about 2 stocks in specific Tesla and Veritone. I invested in these stocks becouse I believed in the Idea behind them and not becouse of the  chart analysis or some ""expert-analyst"" saying what the stock price will be. Was I lucky? OFC BUT in generell going against what people say is the best strategy. 

I could have made a lot more money if I trusted my gut and sticked to my plan. I wanted to keep the Tesla stocks until 2021(ofc I dont know but I sold at the worst possible time They went from 300 to 800 back to 550(where I sold,this what quiet early in the crash) back to 800 down to 330 back to 800 as of now.

Same goes for Veritone I found this gem in early January and I am amazed by AI so I was like I believe in them. I bought some and sold cos of the crash. Then later I bought some at 3 Dollars each and now they are at 7$ I sold them at 6$ each. Tbh my plan again was to just wait until  a few years. But experts said its gonna go down to 3 dollars again so I sold... 

The 3 things I have learned as of now are:

1. Go with your plan no matter what.
2. Dont listen to anyone except your gut unless its against the plan u had cos it will trick you cos you r scared.
3. There is no perfect timing so sweating over opportunity costs aint worth it.

Now my question. Is there any advice you have learned that would help me?

Strong earnings reports, especially from tech companies, drove the markets upwards last week, despite unemployment hitting 14.7%, as the economy shed 20.5M jobs. For context, unemployment reached as high as 25% during the Great Depression. Given the current state of joblessness, why are markets so bullish? Here are the details:

1. **Nearly 30 states have begun to reopen, with another five states with plans to reopen soon.** Investors were bullish about the market as the vast majority of states began to reopen facilities ranging from beaches to retail. As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.
2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.
3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.
4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and &gt;1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.
5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.** South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths. Furthermore, research is beginning to indicate that even mildly affected COVID-19 cases produce antibodies, suggesting potential for at least partial immunity even from those who had low to no symptoms. 

**Overall, I remain optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.** While unemployment is incredibly high, government stimulus have enabled most U.S. citizens to sustain in this difficult situation. The reopening of state economies will hopefully provide the stimulus needed for businesses to start re-hiring those who were laid off, leading to a dramatic decrease in unemployment. The May and June jobs reports will be a strong indicator for our recovery.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,410172,public,confidence,self,5/12 Weekly Update and Expectations,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gio997/512_weekly_update_and_expectations/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve been pretty successfull trading off the oil market in the past month and would like to give a heads up. 

Considering the oil market hasn’t recovered without demand, and that the oil price is too high on hopes of a reopening I think it’s best to short oil now for the upcoming contract expiry for WTI on the 21st.

[PortfolioSummary](https://ibb.co/R6vQ74t)

I posted earlier last week about using python to dive into data and build me a portfolio built of 3 layers of filtering (with staggered weighting). 

Wanted to give an update and get some discussion going, or even get any tips or ideas on other stuff I can do. 

The link up top is my current output from the program I made. I am adding to each day so it is definitely still incomplete. I plan to add things like variance, sharpe ratio, etc... (any other ideas would be great to hear too!)

Currently up about 4%. Highest allocation is in healthcare and tech. You can see more details in the link above!

However, the concerning bit is that he started with $30,000 which is a relatively significant sum because he has not finished paying his home loan and has barely set aside a sum of about 250k for his retirement, which is not much considering that my mother is a dependent as well and only has around 50K in her retirement account. Furthermore, my sibling and I are yet to enter university where a full scholarship is not yet a certainty.  


To compound this problem, he has a layman understanding of the markets and financial markets in general and has barely spent any time practicing on a paper trading account. His main reading consists of articles and bites from Bloomberg and other news outlets. While I have read literature like Graham's Intelligent Investor as well as Phillip Fisher's Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, I feel that his lack of savvy in comparison also highlights a lack of prudence and financial literacy. (It should be noted that I am 19 and have slowly invested most of my savings in Indexes rather than the Forex)

Also when calculating the Discount Rate I've read to calculate WACC and use that. If that's the case how can i find the beta value for the past (yahoo finance lists what i think is the current beta calculation but i was trying to use numbers for GOOG from 12/31/2019 as an exercise).

The Fed is scheduled to start buying junk bonds today as the money printer goes full speed.

As the money supply increases, I have found it interesting that the demand for **Bitcoin**, despite the halving, has not seemed to increase yet. However many low float stocks were on the move yesterday. Not making a conclusion here, just taking note. Everything comes down to supply and demand.

Yesterday markets opened down, eventually went positive and end up flat on the day. Clearly dealing with resistance at this level. Watching for a breakout or breakdown.

The **VIX** remains relatively low and futures are positive right now. I'm still cautiously bullish.

**Watchlist:**

**CREX** is a low float resistance at $4

**ANY** is a low float support at $1.60

**MRAM** is a low float, resistance at $6

**RVP** is a low float, on watch

**NBSE** is a low float, expect support at $8.85

**MLND** is a low float watching for a setup above $2

**CJJD** is a low float, watching for a setup above $2.90

**PRTS** is a lowish float, earning winner, watching for a setup above $5.10

**MARK** was yesterday's big winner, watching for a continuation

**MCRB** watching for a setup above $5.50

Hi,

Does anyone know where I can find the exact composition and weightage of the individual stocks which make up any given ETF?

For example:

An ETF is XLF (Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund). How do I know what stocks exactly it is made up of and what is the weightage of each of those stocks making up this ETF?

Where can I find this info?

I googled around and the most I could find is that Fidelity seems to provide ""portfolio composition file (PCF)"" for ETFs but I am guessing it would be a paid service.

DTCC also seems to provide something similar, but based on their website I could not find anything other than ""Interested in ..........? Contact us""

Does anyone know a free way to find this info? or can point me in the direction to find this?

Update: Based on some more research and Reddit answers, I could find only the 2 below as of now:

1) Zacks

2) morningstar

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you know a more cleaner looking resource, it would be awesome!

Allogene was founded in 2018 by Arie Belldegrun and David Chang, who previously led Kite Pharma to the Yescarta approval and an $11.9 B acquisition by Gilead. While the current high price point presents risks, 2020 will be a critical year for Allogene with multiple early-stage readouts: this presents an opportunity to ride several key value inflection points over the next 6 - 12 months

**Key Takeaways**

* There is a lot to like about the experience the Allogene team brings to the table and the promise of their platform to address the clinical and commercial shortcomings of current marketed CAR-T therapies
* Allogene plans to initiate an abbreviated P1 trial for ALLO-501A in 2Q20 to confirm the results of the ALLO-501 P1 ALPHA trial, results for which will be presented this month at ASCO, prior to potentially advancing ALLO-501A to pivotal P2 development
* If the lead program in NHL (ALLO-501/ALLO-501A) is successful, that represents in the range of 100% upside using Kite Pharma, another CAR-T company, as an analogue
* Kite Pharma was valued at $8.4B prior to the Gilead acquisition with a filed BLA in NHL for Yescarta, double what Allogene is trading at today: given a high PTRS for Allogene’s program in NHL (rationale outlined below), this represents directionally where we would expect Allogene’s value to land in the future
* However, current market cap of &gt;$4 B constrains achievable upside versus the downside risk if near-term value clinical catalysts go against our expectation

*We are taking a modest (1 - 2% of portfolio) position ahead of the two key clinical readouts on 5/13 and 5/29 given our expectation for positive P1 results for ALLO-501 (ALPHA trial) and the 2Q20 initiation of P1/P2 ALPHA2 trial for ALLO-501A based on the following:*

* Strong preliminary P1 safety and efficacy data was presented in 2018 by for UCART19 in ALL, which is the same molecular design as ALLO-501 
* ALLO-501/ALLO-501A target CD-19 in NHL patients, which is the same target as the approved CAR-T’s Kymriah and Yescarta in an overlapping patient population (DLBCL, a subtype of NHL), defraying clinical risk
* Allogene will be taking the dose-finding learnings from the ALPHA trial into the ALPHA2 trials for ALLO-501A, the next-generation construct and P2 candidate in NHL, a switchover that has been planned since before the ALPHA trial was initiated 
* In an earnings call on 05/06, Allogene CEO David Chang indicated that the abbreviated P1 portion of ALPHA2 is on track to begin 2Q20, ahead of a potential pivotal P2 portion
* However, the current price point is somewhat overvalued, and thus does not support us taking a larger position given the potential downside is substantial and potential gains partially already baked in

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***High unmet clinical need:*** substantial need for accessible and efficacious therapies remains in NHL &amp; other hematological malignancies given limited options for r/r patients and the time-consuming and burdensome process required for current CAR-Ts
* ***‘Off the shelf’ CAR-T therapies address shortcomings of current CAR-Ts*****:** the approach would theoretically mitigate the manufacturing issues that continue to drag down the commercial potential of and patient access to existing autologous CAR-T’s
* ***Several critical near-term inflection points in 2020:*** ASCO poster abstract covering initial P1 data for ALLO-501 in r/r NHL (ALPHA trial) will be released on 05/13, with further data including additional patients presented on 5/29. These data will support the ALPHA2 P1 and potential pivotal P2 trial for ALLO-501A, their next-generation construct for NHL. Initial P1 data for ALLO-715 in r/r MM (UNIVERSAL trial) remains on track for 4Q20 despite impact of COVID-19
* ***Experienced leadership team with track record of rapid development and regulatory success in cell therapy:*** CEO David Chang and Executive Chairman Arie Belldegrun were formerly CMO and CEO of Kite Pharma, respectively, and led Yescarta, one of two CAR-T’s on market today, to FDA priority review prior to acquisition by Gilead for $11.9 B (29.4% premium over market close prior to announcement)
* ***Clinical programs focus largely on proven targets:*** ALLO-501/ALLO-501A and UCART19 are anti-CD19 therapies, which is the same target as the approved autologous CAR-Ts Yescarta and Kymriah, which somewhat de-risks these programs. Additional targets in development include BCMA for MM (ALLO-715, including in combination with nirogacestat in collaboration with SpringWorks)
* ***Preliminary UCART19 data offers additional validation of platform:*** preliminary pooled data from P1 trials in ALL indicated that 14/17 (82%) of patients receiving an anti-CD52 antibody during lymphodepletion achieved a complete response (CR/CRi). The anti-CD52 antibody serves to protect the allogeneic CAR-T’s from being cleared by the body’s immune system. ALLO-501, ALLO-501A, and ALLO-715 are all dosed with ALLO-647, Allogene’s internally developed anti-CD52 antibody, creating a “window of persistence” during which the allogeneic CAR-T’s can exert their therapeutic effect

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Value of pipeline programs heavily interdependent:*** Given the clinical stage therapies are rooted in the same technology platform, any issues that emerge from the ALPHA or UNIVERSAL trials could feasibly drag down the value of the entire pipeline. On the flipside, however, positive preliminary ALPHA data would likely have the reverse effect of increasing PTRS across the clinical-stage portfolio
* ***Stock currently trading at / near 52 week high:*** While Allogene traded in the $18 - 20 range for the latter part of March, the price has rebounded steadily upwards and scraped against an all-time high today on just-shy of average volume, reflecting both the overall market rebound and likely enthusiasm from the market for the impending ASCO data. This suggests there is significant immediate downside if the data falls short of expectations on 5/13 and 5/29
* ***Long-term competitive risk is substantial:*** While Allogene is a leader in the field, the next-generation CAR-T space is fairly crowded. In addition, Fate Therapeutics (market cap: $2.3 B) has a pipeline of iPSC-derived natural killer and T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors reaching the clinic. While Allogene is exploring the iPSC space as mentioned above, Fate Tx has reached the clinic already, which may provide them with a leg-up in the long-run

The average American has $3000 in their savings account so I’m double that. At 29.

Just wanted to say thanks to the haters. They really gave me the motivation to learn how to get rich. My friend literally just told me today that he has $300 to his name and his rent is coming up soon. So think about how much more I have than him.

Big Takeaway: The SEC has RSS feeds that can automatically notify you of a company’s filings the moment they are published. It is therefore easy to be the first to know. No need to pay for a service that does this for you. 

Overview: With the wide spread availability of trading applications there came a number of retail traders who dove into trading without knowing the power of reading and understanding company SEC filings. SEC filings can provide critical indicators (""indicators"" not ""guarantees"") as to a companies past and future performance. These documents can be an essential tool in helping an investor gauge whether to buy or sell a security. The purpose of the following entry is to provide a brief introduction to some of the most pertinent SEC Forms. 

Why Read SEC Forms?: An important part of doing your due diligence on a company before you invest is checking out their most recent and historical SEC filings. These filings, if read and assessed properly with other market signals, may be a good indicator of a companies financial strength and institutional and insider confidence. For example, a microcap or smallcap trader will want to assess how long a company can remain financially viable without releasing another offering, or perhaps, assess at what price an investor may exercise a previously issued warrant. A midcap and largecap investor might want to know what institutions and insiders are buying, and to what extent a company is growing revenue. In short, learning to read and analyze SEC Forms (combined with other market conditions) will give you a competitive advantage as a trader. 

EDGAR: There are a number of ways an investor can look up company SEC filings. However if you want to go straight to the horses mouth you go to the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system; otherwise known as ""EDGAR."" I recommend simply typing in the ticker of your choosing into the ""Fast Search"" feature. From there you can find all of a company's SEC filings. If you really wanted to get savvy you can see all of your companies SEC filings as they are instantly filed by using your favorite RSS feed app. That's how right! for your convenience the SEC has an RSS feature for practically anything you want to look for. That way you will be among the first to be alerted when a company you're tracking files with the SEC. And just to think there are websites that charge for this kind of alert feature! Like most alerting software, its just a rip off for something you can otherwise get for free.

I am only 20% invested, because I think that the market is retarded

I am 80% out until I see a big drop in the market (where I buy), or there is a clear breakthrough in the vaccine and positive economic data AND only then i'll invest my remaining 80%

My Current Holdings are:

JPM / AXP / MS / ABBV / MRK / GILD / WMT / AMZN / [LHE.DE](https://LHE.DE) (this on is risky)

I am pretty much investing in financials because they are at fairly low prices (compared to other sectors)

And then my next holdings are the recession proof ones (Healthcare and Retail)

The two chronicle the financialization of the global economy that occurred between the end of gold convertibility in 1971 and the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. They discuss how the period of the 1970’s weighed heavily on the American zeitgeist and the political transformation that occurred between the start of the Iran hostage crisis and the fall of the Berlin Wall.

If you hade billions of dollars and little faith in the economy, where would you put it? Gold? It’s near ATHs so the potential for loss is high. Bonds? At these rates? Cash? With infinite QE happening inflation could be a real concern. No it’s tech. Tech has performed very well over the past 20 years and many tech companies are minimally affected by the current environment. Some even benefit. What’s more tech has some of the biggest most stable companies there are with plenty of cash on hand to weather a storm. So tech seems like a safe bet. 


If I’m right tech is acting as a safe place to stash billions of dollars. Because the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are disproportionately made up by large tech firms, and because those are seen as the best indicators for the broader market, this makes the broader market look better than it should. It’s giving people a false sense of confidence in the market as a whole. 

What happens if the smart money no longer feels like tech is the safest place to store their money? The bottom falls out. What happens when mainstreet actually starts to recover? Billions of dollars flow out of tech and into other sectors. Much of it may go to small cap stocks. So when the economy actually starts improving, the S&amp;P and Nasdaq may crater.

BlueCrest had been one of the biggest hedge funds in Europe, with $37 billion of assets under management.

However, after a few years of disappointing returns, investors became less enamoured with Platt. 

[One issue they focused on was a proprietary BlueCrest fund](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/fund-within-a-fund-creates-a-conflict/) that only managed Platt’s capital and money belonging to other BlueCrest partners and employees.

As well as this, institutional investors were pushing for lower fees.

Hedge funds typically follow a “2 and 20” model: Investors pay an annual management fee of 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of profits.

According to Platt, ""It's much more profitable to have 0 and 100 rather than 2 and 20,""

This refers to the fact that they don't need to share profits with outside investors.

So in 2015 Platt returned the $7 billion BlueCrest managed for outside clients and decided to turn BlueCrest into a private investment partnership and focus on managing his own wealth and that of his partners and employees.

This decision has certainly paid off handsomely for Platt and BlueCrest.

Since 2015 he has more than doubled his net worth - which currently sits at $8 billion.

In 2019, BlueCrest returned 53.5% net after expenses and [Platt made about $2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2020/02/03/hedge-fund-trader-michael-platt-made-2-billion-in-2019-without-any-clients/#77bbaf264035).

With a much smaller asset base, Platt has increased leverage, took on more risk, and enjoyed strong returns. 

The majority of BlueCrest’s returns did not come from trading equities, which surged last year, but from significant long fixed income positions early in 2019.

Platt first became involved in the markets through his grandmother. 

""She was a long-term investor and did very well at it. She was a very strong woman. She wasn't interested in baking cake for me; she was interested in what stock I wanted to buy or sell.""

Platt states that he has had a very easy life because he never had to think about what he wanted to do:

He wanted to be a trader from the age of 12 and started when he was 13, successfully trading stocks through high school and university with one major exception - the infamous Black Monday Crash of 1987, when his stock account lost half its value in a single day.

Platt has no tolerance for trading losses:

""I hate losing money more than anything. Losing money is what kills you. It is not the actual loss. It's the fact that it messes up your psychology.""

Platt believes in aggressive stop losses and effectively structures his *traders* like they are options

He will cut trader's allocations by half if lose 3% of their capital and remove their capital allocation if they lose more than 6%.

However, he will also lift allocations to winning trades - therefore the downside is limited, but the upside is unlimited. 

""We want people to scale down if they are getting it wrong and scale up if they are getting it right. If a guy has a $100 million allocation and makes $20 million, he then has $23 million to his stop point.""

But what does Platt looks for in his traders?

**Someone who has an edge:**

""I look for the type of guy in London who gets up at seven o'clock on Sunday morning when his kids are still in bed, and logs onto a poker site so that he can pick off the U.S. drunks coming home on Saturday night. I hired a guy like that. He usually clears 5 or 10 grand every Sunday morning before breakfast taking out the drunks playing poker because they're not very good at it, but their confidence has gone up a lot.""

**Paranoia:**

""I want guys who when they put on a good trade immediately start thinking about what they could put on against it. They just have the paranoia.""

**The market is always right:**

""Market makers know that the market is always right. They know value is irrelevant in times of market stress; it's all about positions. They understand that markets will trade against positions. They get it.""

**Someone who admits they are wrong:**

""Both the ex-market makers who blew up became way too invested in their positions. Their ego got in the way. They just didn't want to be wrong, and they stayed in their positions.""

Recently, it was reported that [BlueCrest cut at least 10 portfolio managers](https://www.businessinsider.com/citadels-relative-value-losses-last-week-wiped-nearly-all-gains-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T) as the firm suffered losses in its fixed-income relative value strategy.

It also cut risk across the firm by about $1 billion.

Relative-value trades involve trying to profit from small differences in the prices of similar assets, such as two different Treasury bonds or a bond versus a future. 

To boost profitability, portfolio mangers tend to employ substantial leverage. 

Therefore, they rely on the steady availability of financing and a relatively stable relationship between the securities in the portfolio. This means that, when volatility increases sharply, losses can mount very quickly.

While BlueCrest suffered some losses since the sell-off, they are apparently still up for the year.

Over the 15 years that BlueCrest managed client money, they produced more than $22 billion in trading profits for investors.

It's not quite the insane returns of the [GOAT hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies' Medallion fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI), but nonetheless still pretty good.

**Since becoming a private investment partnership in 2015, the returns have been sensational.**

**2016: 50%**

**2017: 54%**

**2018: 25%**

**2019: 53.5%**

What I’m having a hard time understanding is the overwhelmingly bearish sentiment in banking and the highly bullish sentiment in tech. Several companies on the Nasdaq are at or near ATHs and the Nasdaq is famously up on the year. All the while the banking sector of the S&amp;P is down 38% YTD. And it’s not a wide disbursement between them where the best are recovering. Most banks are still very much beaten down from their 52 week highs. They are widely underperforming the broad S&amp;P by almost 30% year to date.

So this got me to thinking, how does this scenario play out? The banks put up reserves in 1Q in order to reserve for adverse loan performance expected in 2Q. Based on market reaction, I can only think people believe that actual performance will be worse than expected (since banks like JPM were able to still have positive earnings in 1Q even after shaving off a significant portion for reserves).

So what scenario exists where defaults absolutely swamp the banks to the degree that they are throwing off significant losses and revenues of all these tech companies is fine? I view the banks as a pretty integral part of the economy’s health. If you have massive loan defaults, how is this not going to impact the entire economy?

Institutions control the overwhelming majority of the power to sway the markets. Blue chip companies - check who hold their largest voting blocs - it’s the institutions: BlackRock, Vanguard, et al. Who controls the ETFs? The pension funds that the peasants store their measly savings in? The same old boys’ club. It is they who set the share prices, period.

Everyone talks about how it’s FOMO that’s driving prices up the wall. But because they aren’t allowed to, no one ever talks about the puppet masters behind the scenes. Yes, maybe the retail trade sector has some nominal influence to an extent but the real clout is held by the big guns. AND the exchanges that the populace punt on. That’s why, if you’ll notice, the markets move in almost perfect lockstep. They move these massive blocks at the precise time of their choosing. No one ever talks about how the institutions know exactly where the market is going at any given point in time not because they can predict the future but because they are the ones that manipulate it and set the prices.

Who came out and called the bottom after the smoke cleared and the dust settled? Larry Fink who advises Trump and heads BlackRock, a firm that has been tasked by the Fed to run several stimulus programmes, and strategists’ at Goldman Sachs, among others. Rick Rieder, also of BlackRock, sits on a committee of the New York Fed. The lion’s share of the newly printed stimulus trillions is flooding into their coffers and washing out all the bad debt. Voila, their books are squeaky clean all of a sudden. Where do they pour this fresh cash? Into the markets, inflating it and thereby locking out everyone else.

In this thinly-veiled vulgar display of crony capitalism, they have flaunted that they will never be held accountable and thus the same tired behaviour will continue ad infinitum, and the next decade/s-long bull market will no doubt be a repeat of the infantile card pyramid debt-stacking that we’ve all seen eventually fall over and over, time and time again, the mess promptly swept under the rug by Uncle Sam in a mammy apron. 

Meanwhile, stimulus for main street and the working class quickly runs out, having been reduced to sloppy seconds by the ruling class who must always have their fill first, yields of anything other than equities, and maybe gold, are negative or at best infinitesimal, market valuations are at exorbitant and hardly-justifiable all-time highs, and the commonfolk are once again caught holding the bag with a quickly-sinking economy, ever-increasing and never-before-seen levels of unemployment and rapidly-rotting debt, and of course, the piece-de-resistance, the cherry on the creampie, a horrendously-manhandled health crisis, haphazardly steered by a drunk driver who’s only destination is reelection, passengers’ destination be damned.

Needless to say, with election season swiftly approaching, Trump, with a fire under his ass, has persisted to vigorously whip JPow’s already-red-raw booty, to get him to crank that printer ever faster in an explosion of meaningless paper.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,408724,public,confidence,self,Institutions,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ghmj7i/institutions/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About a month and a half back I figured out it's about time I begin investing since I'm 26.  
Encouraged by using Revolut as my financial management instrument I bought a bunch of stocks and have driven minor analysis. Decisions that I have made are based on two factors:

1. Products that I am personally using + a lot of buzz among my millenial friends.
2. Reading charts + checking most recent news.

Within a month and a half I have built a portfolio of 6 different companies and my  picks were:

&amp;#x200B;

ETSY -&gt; up 52.96% to date

BYND -&gt; up 62.67% to date

UBER -&gt; up 54.78% to date

HLTN -&gt; up 14.81% to date

NPTN -&gt; up 9.7% to date

GRPN -&gt; down 14.07% to date

&amp;#x200B;

Overall my portfolio is up 30%. How do I keep growing from that point? I really would like to make sure my portfolio is well maintained but I don't want to make it my daily obsession. I would really like to make it as passive as possible while keeping my portfolio healthy. Should I sell some of the stocks sometimes? Should I keep on investing in the ones that I currently have - if so when is the right time? How to best manage what I currently have?

Last week the S&amp;P 500 had a strong rally off of support. As earnings season winds down the S&amp;P 500 is up against some old resistance from last August.

The **VIX** remains relatively low this morning in a positive sign for the bulls. Futures are drifting lower ahead of the open. We may be entering summer with lower volatility, I think the market is waiting on the next catalyst.

Bitcoin failed to hold $10,000 this weekend. The halving is tomorrow. On watch but no trade planned at this point.

**Watchlist:**

**RVP** is a low float with resistance in the $5.30s

**NBSE** is a low float with resistance at $8.85

**TORC** is a lowish float Resistance at $2

**PRTS** is an earnings winner, lowish float, watching for some volume to come in first

**VUZI** another lowish float, support at $2.50, resistance at $3

**MARK** has resistance at $1.18

**MCRB** has support at $4.50

There can be no hiding from the awful economic data that is now pouring in from all angles as we move well into the second quarter. Australian jobs, UK Q1 GDP, and US retail sales and inflation numbers will be the next key releases to showcase the virus-inflicted damage. But amid growing optimism about the pandemic easing, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will likely err on the side of caution at its policy meeting, posing a downside risk for the Kiwi and other commodity dollars.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** 

US stocks continued to grind higher, while Fed Futures edged away from negative interest rates territory to hover around 0%. With interest rates edging higher, Gold lost some momentum and backed off more than 1% from the highs. USD, however, remained weak against most developed currencies except the JPY. With stock sentiment diverging from the economic reality, it has become a market that requires patience as fundamentals will eventually matter again. 

With Australia and New Zealand seemingly doing all the right things to keep the outbreak under control, their currencies are leading the way in this bout of USD weakness.

* The company has two late-stage (Phase 2/3) programs, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, targeting rare tumor types with high unmet need (either insufficient therapies or no available therapies). Past trial data gives us confidence in their chances of approval, and we expect these candidates to be approved in 2022 and 2023 respectively, upon which they will become first-in-class drugs in their respective indications through their differentiated clinical profiles. 
* Springworks has signed collaborations with major biotech companies to develop several interesting early stage assets in additional oncology indications, providing a degree of validation of Springworks’ assets and creating a future growth runway. 
* We anticipate several value-creating milestones over the next year, namely topline data from nirogacestat’s registrational Phase 3 trial in mid-2021 and an interim update from mirdametinib’s registrational Phase 2b in 1Q21. 
* Our DCF analysis assigns Springworks a price target of $55, assuming an 85% probability of success for nirogacestat and mirdametinib in their main indications, and using an 11% discount rate and 2% terminal growth rate. 

**Company Background:** Springworks was established in 2017 as a spinoff from Pfizer, which provided the company with initial funding and the development rights to its 4 clinical assets. Springworks raised \~$230M from investors including Bain Capital and OrbiMed Advisors before going public in September 2019. 

**1. Late-stage Clinical Programs in Areas of High Unmet Need:** Springworks has two late stage programs currently in registrational or potentially registrational trials:

Nirogacestat. Nirogacestat is an oral, selective gamma secretase inhibitor developed to treat desmoid tumors. 

* *Desmoid tumors.* Desmoid tumors are highly morbid, soft tissue tumors with an estimated 6,000 patients being treated in the US every year. 
* *Unmet need.* Though survival rates for desmoid tumors are relatively high compared to other cancer types, desmoid tumors place a heavy burden on patients’ quality of life; they can interfere with the function of nearby structures (e.g. intestines), are painful to live with, and highly disfiguring. Treatment has traditionally been via surgical resection, but this method has been associated with recurrence rates of up to 70%. Chemotherapy and other targeted cancer therapies have been used off-label as well, but these have shown inconsistent efficacy and unfavorable safety profiles. 
* Nirogacestat has received FDA breakthrough and orphan drug designation.

Mirdametinib. Mirdametinib is an oral, selective MEK inhibitor developed to treat NF1-associate plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). 

* *NF1-PN.* The NF1 gene produces neurofibromin, a protein that represses a key signaling pathway (RAS/MAPK) responsible for the growth of many cancers. When the NF1 gene is mutated, the loss of neurofibromin production allows this pathway to run unchecked, resulting in tumor growth across the body. There are \~100k NF1 patients in the US, and 30-50% of these patients can develop plexiform neurofibromas, which are tumors that grow along nerves. 
* *Unmet need.* NF1-PN are associated with extreme pain and disfigurement as well as interference with neurocognitive function. First-line therapy is usually surgical resection, but NF1-PN extensive growth patterns along nerves make them hard to completely remove (while risking nerve damage). 
* There is one approved MEK inhibitor for NF1-PN, AstaZeneca’s selumetinib, which was approved in April 2020. While the drug works, mirdametinib has demonstrated a potentially superior safety profile vs. selumetinib, which should allow patients to remain on therapy longer and experience more clinical benefit. 
* Mirdametinib has received FDA orphan drug designation. 

**2. Promising Clinical Data.** 

Nirogacestat. To date, nirogacestat has shown a promising clinical profile in its Phase 1 and 2 trials. The drug is currently enrolling patients in its Phase 3 trial, with progression free survival (PFS, a measure of how long patients live without their tumors growing &gt;20% in size) as the primary endpoint. 

* *Phase 1.* Nirogacestat achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 71.4% in its 7-patient Phase 1 trial (5/7), and a 100% disease control rate (DCR). Patients were able to stay on the drug for a median of 49.5 months (at the time of publication, so possibly longer), and none went off treatment due to safety issues. 
* *Phase 2.* In a heavily pre-treated population (median 4 lines of prior therapy vs. 3 in Phase 1 i.e. sicker patients), nirogacestat again achieved a 100% DCR and a 29.4% ORR. More importantly, 59% of patients remained on drug for more than 2 years. The drug was well tolerated with only 1 patient discontinuing treatment due to side effects. 
* *Phase 3.* A 115-patient Phase 3 trial is currently enrolling patients. The trial is powered to show a 12-month difference in PFS vs. placebo, and past trials from a similar drug showed that 50% of placebo patients experience disease progression by 8 months, which compares favorably to what nirogacestat has demonstrated in its Phase 1/2 trials. 
* The Phase 3 trial is expected to readout in 2Q/3Q21 and we expect approval of nirogacestat in 2022. 

Mirdametinib.  

* *Phase 2.* In its Phase 2 trial, Mirdametinib demonstrated a 42% ORR in 8/19 patients. In contrast, selumetinib demonstrated a 74% ORR in its Phase 2 trial. Though selumetinib’s Phase 2 data was numerically superior to mirdametinib’s, we believe several factors artificially limited mirdametinib’s efficacy:
   * Selumetinib’s trial enrolled only children while mirdametinib’s trial included only patients 16 years or older. Tumors in younger children are considered to be more responsive to therapy than those in adults. 
   * Patients in the mirdametinib trial were removed from the trial if they did not show signs of benefit within 12 months, which may have limited the number responses; 30% of selumetinib’s patients did not respond until after 12 months on drug. 
* *Safety benefits.* In its Phase 2, only 5 out of 19 patients (26%) required dose reductions of mirdametinib. In contrast, in selumetinib’s Phase 1, 10 out of 24 patients (42%) required dose reductions due to toxicity issues. We believe that this is evidence that mirdametinib is a safer drug than selumetinib, which will be an important differentiating factor for doctors deciding between the two drugs. 
* *Phase 2b.* Springworks is currently enrolling patients for a 100-patient Phase 2b trial of mirdametinib (primary endpoint ORR) that could support approval in 2023. The trial will enroll an even split of pediatric and adult patients and will not remove patients before 12 months. We expect that mirdametinib will show a similar ORR to selumetinib and differentiate itself via a superior safety profile. 

**3. Intriguing Early Stage Programs.**

* **Nirogacestat for Multiple Myeloma Therapy.** Nirogacestat is also being evaluated as an add-on therapy to BCMA therapies for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells with \~27k patients in the US every year. These drugs target a protein called BCMA on the surface of cancer cells, and preclinical data has shown that nirogacestat significantly upregulates the expression of BCMA on cancer cells and enhanced the potency of BCMA-targeting drugs. Springworks has already signed collaborations with Glaxo Smith Kline and Allogene Therapeutics to use nirogacestat in combination trials with their BCMA drugs. 
* **BGB-3245.** Springworks has also signed a collaboration agreement with Beigene, a leading China biotech company, to develop a novel cancer drug targeting BRAF-mutant solid tumors. BRAF is a validated oncology target that is clinically relevant in melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. BGB-3245 has been shown in preclinical models to be effective in inhibiting certain mutant forms of BRAF that currently approved BRAF inhibitors cannot target. A Phase 1 trial for BGB-3245 has been initiated in Australia. 

**4. Strong Balance Sheet:** As of the end of 2019, Springworks had \~$330M in cash and no debt. This is expected to be sufficient to fund operations and support its 6 clinical trials through the end of 2022. The company has not indicated that its clinical development timelines have been impacted by Covid, but we will be on the lookout for any future guidance. 

**5. Experienced Leadership:** Springworks is led by a world-class management team with deep pharma industry experience. Selected leadership includes:

* Chief Executive Officer Saqib Islam is a founding member of the company and was formerly the Chief Business Officer at Moderna. Prior to Moderna, he held senior leadership roles at Alexion Pharmaceuticals (a $20B rare disease biotech).
* Chief Medical Officer Jens Renstrup was formerly Head of Medical Affairs at Alexion, where he was instrumental in building out its pipeline. Prior to Alexion, he led medical affairs at Glaxo Smith Kline’s vaccine division. 
* Head of R&amp;D Stephen Squinto is a venture partner at OrbiMed, a highly respected life science investment firm. He is also a co-founder of Alexion, where he led global operations and R&amp;D for over 20 years. 

**6. Risks.** Potential investors should be aware that Springworks is exposed to the following key risks as a biotech company:

* *Clinical development risk.* Springworks’ assets could fail their clinical trials due to unfavorable or uncompetitive clinical data and/or unexpected safety issues. 
* *Competitive risk.* Springworks’ drugs could be leapfrogged by more effective drugs, severely limiting their commercial potential. 
* *Financial risk.* Unexpected costs/circumstances could lead to the company running out of cash and having to raise dilutive capital and/or shut down.

Which ""market"" are they referring to? Assuming Equities, which equities and index? MSCI World? S&amp;P500? FTSE100? ASX200? Emerging markets?Many portfolios suggested here seem to suggest a strong U.S. bias for equities, and even an MSCI world would have almost 40% U.S. equity exposure. While it's true that the S&amp;P500 has had strong past returns over many time periods, there's plenty of research suggesting that over the same periods other markets have outperformed.Let's assume for a minute that ""the market"" is the S&amp;P500 (or MSCI world index, irrelevant for my point). In times of low-cost ETFs widely available and being able to shift the weightings of one's portfolio relatively easily to replicate a strategy, I think it makes sense to compare this reference index and their **risk adjusted returns** to other indices along different dimensions. For equities, the obvious ones are

* **Geographic focus** Comparing reference indices in different countries can be an interesting exercise. Quite surprisingly, the Australian, South African, and Swedish stock market have had higher *risk adjusted* returns over different periods (16 years, 40 years, 116 years) than the S&amp;P500. [https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/07/30/which-country-has-the-best-stock-market/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/07/30/which-country-has-the-best-stock-market/) One might also look into historic performance of emerging markets vs. U.S, Europe or OECD.
* **Company size** There's plenty of research suggesting that small caps, at least in certain geographies, have historically outperformed large cap over long periods of time. [https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/)
* **Company type** Over the past decade, 'growth' stocks have outperformed 'value'-stocks in the U.S. and other markets.
* **Sector focus** Similarly, if one had put more emphasis on tech (e.g. NASDAQ) and placed their bet on buying QQQ, returns would have significantly higher since the past bull run.

Now obviously past performance does not predict future returns, but it's one data point and can be considered alongside other factors. These include current valuations of such markets or sectors (particularly when it comes to investing lump sums at a certain point of time) and more importantly larger themes such as changes in political landscapes and the geopolitical environment, climate change and shift towards renewables, urbanization (or de-urbanization due to COVID?), digitization, etc.With a lot of data on past performance of different indices available and reflecting on major socioeconomic and political trends that will shape our lives in the next decades, I'd be interested in creating a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs, which over the next 20-30 years is likely to outperform the classic bogleheads 3-fund portfolio or an MSCI world and potentially offer higher risk-adjusted returns compared to those indices. Suggestions should be evidence-based on a combination of past returns and outlook into the future, rather than saying ""just put your money into FANG or an AI or ROBO-ETF"".With that in mind, which mix of markets, or sectors, do you see outperforming over the next decades compared to a S&amp;P500 or MSCI world reference index, how would you build a low-cost portfolio based on that strategy, and with which weightings?

So first of all, I am far from an expert on this, but I have been doing a lot of research on the FED and the money supply. As part of a bigger project that I'm working on (that I might present on here some day) I have accumulated some good information on this specific topic. I will present some of this and then share my 2 cents based on what I've learned so far.

As I started out, one of the first things I wanted to know was how the FEDs balance sheet stacked up in comparison to the major dollar denominated areas of the economy. Here's what I found:

Cryptos: $.16T

M0 Money (physical cash): $1.84T

*FED Balance Sheet: $6T (up from about $4T before CV)*

Gold: $7T

Dollar Denominated Debt (outside of US): $11T

US 2019 GDP: $21T

US Housing Market: $30T

M1 Money (M0+savings/checking deposits): $37T

US Private and Public Debt: $52T

Stock Market: $74T

M2 Money Supply (M0+M1+other liquid assets): $90T

Derivatives: $1,200T

Along the way, I learned quite a bit, and have (3) points I'd like to share. Again, these are just my opinions, so hopefully some smarter folks can correct or add to what I've laid out. I'm much more interested in discussing/learning than persuading or being right, so please feel free to pick my points apart.

1. FED bucks - While $2T of extra dollars in the economy is an astounding number and is certainly unprecedented, I don't think it (directly) affects the stock market as much as I thought before I started reading up about this. For one, while it's impossible to know exactly how much, I think the percentage of FED generated dollars that trickled into the market is rather small (though admittedly, this gets extremely complicated and tough to cover why in a single post). Secondly, even if every single dollar somehow made it into the market, $2T is still only a smaller percentage of the total market cap and would not come close to making up all of the massive retracement we've seen since the March lows. I think that ultimately the optimism the fed purchases create are much more of a factor on the stock market than the actual dollars themselves.

2. Deflation - If the economy remains in recession for an extended period of time, there is much more outstanding US dollar denominated debt at risk of defaulting than the FED would ever be able to responsibly inject (at least when they still followed the rules of the federal reserve act). The other problem is, even if they do set the printers into overdrive to perfectly match the rate of deflation, the ability to get the right amount of dollars in the right places, is a nearly impossible task. As we've seen with the stimulus packages so far, the government is extremely inept at effectively allocating resources correctly. To fully stop the massive wave of defaults we have coming, we would need a cooperative government, along with the fed, fairly distributing trillions and trillions of dollars with such precision that we got it correct, right down the individual debtor. We have protections in place that restrain the gov and FED from manipulating our economy too much in this manner. This is a good thing, but there really aren't existing processes that would allow for the selective distribution on a massive (yet precise) scale this would require. I could probably do an entire separate post on the money cycle and how money gets into and flows through the economy, but just suffice it to say it is an extremely convoluted, corrupt, and inefficient process. Another problem is, as shown above, nearly $11T of that debt is outside of the US. These economies are mostly all in worse shape than the US and it will be very challenging for them to get their hands on the dollars they need to service their debts as their economies shrink (lookup Milkshake Theory if you are interested in more information on this). The potential for all this massive deleveraging (reduced dollar supply as debors default) and an increase in demand for dollars should drive the dollar up vs other assets (deflation). I think the reason we haven't seen it so far is this will take months and even years to fully play out. Even though savings levels across the board are extremely low (personal, corp, gov, etc), these institutions aren't going to default after just a month or two of a receding economy.

3. Nowhere else to go with money - So why does the stock market keep going up then? The best conclusion I've been able to reach is, compared to other options the stock market is just as good (or just as bad) as anything else and people still have money on hand that they need to do something with. Yeah, the stock market is in a bubble, but so are many other investment options. I think the big institutions know that deflation is ultimately on the horizon, but as mentioned above, it will take a long time for the deleveraging to play out and while everyone is still flush with cash, there are gains to be made on the bullish short-sightedness. They will be converting to cash as they sell out at these high retracement levels, but again this isn't going to necessarily happen overnight. I think the average retail investor (myself included) expects these moves downward to come more quickly because of how fast and extreme the first move down was. However, if you look back in history, past bear markets played out much slower and longer than that. While the market could tank again next week, it could be also be several months or more.

So based on this, my strategy for the rest of the year is to hold mostly cash, a little gold and silver (as a safety measure), and I do have some active shorts on (in hinds sight I probably would have gotten into these after some more decidedly downward action, but am fine holding in the meantime). I don't know if this will all play out, but I do not feel comfortable buying in at these prices and am completely fine missing out (on what I believe) to be short term gains of the bull market hysteria I've been seeing.

With a massive downturn in consumer spending because of the pandemic, deflation on a bunch of goods is likely .. right?

But there's also a supply side shock essentially doing the opposite in certain areas of the economy. 

Also, ""printing"" tends to benefit the wealthy and usually increases inequality.. but we have an unusual occurance of cheques going out to regular people that might possibly go on for a little while.

As lockdowns ease and parts of the world reopen for business, driving has emerged as the socially distant transportation mode of choice and is offering some near-term relief to an oil market fresh off its worst crash in history and reeling from an unprecedented collapse in energy demand.

Im currently in the stage fine tuning my trading plan. I trade with the MAs but every time i read something new they suggest a different MA some recommend short ones and some recommend longer ones like the 200MA.

I day trade so i assume the shorter MA's are more reliable  for the way i trade? Do you use different MAs for different time frames? Would it be good to use a 200MA on a weekly chart to get a better understanding of the overall trend or is that irrelevant for trading in such a small time frame. I think most of the information i read is meant more for swing trading which is why i see so many differing opinions.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 11th, 2020.

# **Stocks are expected to trade the economy’s reopening in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/stocks-expected-to-trade-the-economys-reopening-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will watch the economy’s reopening progress, as well as a series of economic reports in the coming week that will provide a look at the consumer during April as the economy shed 20.5 million jobs.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on a webcast held by the Peterson Institute on Wednesday at 9 a.m., and he will be watched closely for any new insights on the economy or Fed programs.
*****
&gt; There are just a few earnings releases ahead, but there will be a barrage of economic reports, including consumer and producer inflation, consumer sentiment and most importantly retail sales on Friday. 
*****
&gt; # Stocks versus bonds
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, even as some bond yields touched record lows. Yields move opposite price, and bonds usually move opposite stocks.
*****
&gt; “The stock market is trading the reopening, and the bond market is doubting the vibrant pace of an economic recovery upon the reopening,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; Small cap stocks and tech led the way higher in the past week. The Nasdaq jumped 6% in a week, where it wiped out its losses for the year and turned positive. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 5.5%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.5% for the week to 2,929, with tech up 6.6% and consumer discretionary stocks up 4.4%.
*****
&gt; The bond market and stock market have both responded to the Fed’s programs that put more liquidity into the financial system, with bond rates falling and stocks rising sharply.
*****
&gt; “Stocks just seem to be disconnected from everything else,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo. Some bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year yield, which impacts many types of loans, were slightly higher ahead of the Treasury’s record $96 billion in auctions in the coming week. But the 2-year, at a new low of 0.10%, was trading on concerns about the economy.
*****
&gt; Market pros will look for Powell to comment on market speculation that the Fed could take its benchmark rate to a negative yield. Fed officials have said they have no interest in negative rates, which are being used by central banks in Europe and Japan. But for the first time this past week, traders drove futures on fed funds to show slightly negative rates in contracts starting in  November. 
*****
&gt; “He could quash negative yields if he wants to,” said Schumacher. “The Fed has consistently argued against negative policy rates. Now there’s a chance Powell could comment on this. He’s commented about it, several times in the last six months.”
*****
&gt; Much of the gains in the stock market have been driven by big technology companies with operations that haven’t been deeply affected by the coronavirus.
*****
&gt; “Tech was the shutdown trade and small caps are the reopening,” said Boockvar, noting small caps are domestically focused and are sensitive to the back-to-work trade.
*****
&gt; Apple joined the reopening trade Friday, when its stock rose after it announced it would reopen some of its U.S. stores.
*****
&gt; “The stock market has sort of a hall pass as the months proceed and things reopen. At some point, that hall pass is going to expire” and the reopenings will have to result in rebound, Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Investors have been watching for anything that suggests state reopenings are stimulating activity.
*****
&gt; Retail sales Friday will be a big focus and are expected to show sharp decline of 11%, but more like 6% when automobiles and gasoline are removed, he said.
*****
&gt; In the oil market in the past week, crude was up as much as 24% as traders reacted to information that showed gasoline demand picking up around the U.S. States have been opening up at different speeds, and California was the latest to reopen some activity Friday.
*****
&gt; “Some of the reason the market is up because the virus curve is bending, the economic data is showing signs of a bounce. It hasn’t here yet but you know it’s coming. It’s a global phenomenon,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He noted that China’s export numbers unexpectedly rose in April, for the first time this year.
*****
&gt; Paulsen said he expects stocks to remain in an upswing.
*****
&gt; “There’s a lot of value out there if you’re outside the high growth in the S&amp;P 500,” he said, “When fear is as high as it is, that’s typically been a great time to lean toward risk assets. Gold is at a 50-year high relative to commodity prices. People are buying bonds at virtually zero yield. To me, there’s fairly defensive behavior and scared attitudes rather than the other way around.”
*****
&gt; Strategists say the market could retest its March lows, but a good number say the bottom has been set.
*****
&gt; “I’m getting more confident that we’ve seen the lows, and we’re starting a recovery in the stock market, but I think the volatility is going to stay there, and there will be challenges. I think the general direction is up rather than down at the moment,” said Paulsen.
*****
&gt; Paulsen said the fear of reinfection remains, should there be a new wave of the virus. “There’s a lot of terrible things that could happen and be terrible for the stock market,” he said.  “A headline could create an up or down week and then go away again. ” 
*****
&gt; “I think the rise in the stock market is really more about a lack of sellers. But I don’t think there’s a lot of buyers. If more people believed this is winding down ... there could be a  lot more money that’s going to come back into equities, to some extent,” Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; Market pros are keeping an eye on yields, ahead of the government’s record sized $96 billion in auctions in the coming week for 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.

# Market Too Far Ahead of Economy?

&gt; Another 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment last week bringing the seven-week total to 33.5 million. This is an unprecedented streak for an unprecedented time, and it highlights the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic shutdown is having. One small positive aspect of this week’s number is the fact that it is a decline from the previous reading which lends further support to the possibility that the market’s lows of March could be the bottom and that bottom could hold based upon the historical correlation of jobless claims and past market bottoms that we covered in a recent post.

&gt; However, the seven-week total is an unsettling number that suggests the road back to “normal” could be longer than the market appears to currently expect. It is getting increasingly more challenging to envision 33.5 million Americans returning to work as quickly as they left. And with NASDAQ returning to positive for the year in today’s trading it may be time to wonder if the market’s brisk recovery is possibly too far ahead of the actual economy.

&gt; One early sign that the rally may be getting well ahead of the economy can be seen in the following chart of cumulative daily advance/decline lines for NYSE, NASDAQ, Russell 2000 and the S&amp;P 500. The recent trend since the end of April has been lower while the indexes have managed to move modestly higher. This suggests that fewer and fewer stocks are still participating in the rally. Historically when this persisted the major indexes frequently failed to move meaningfully higher and often turned lower.

# Market Gains in Celebration of Mother’s Day

&gt; With just a few days remaining to Mother’s Day, today’s post is also a reminder. Over the last twenty-five years on the Friday before Mother’s Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground seventeen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times over the same time period. Average gain on Friday has been 0.20% and a respectable 0.36% on Monday. However, in five of the last eight years, the Monday following Mother’s Day has been down. Last year, DJIA suffered its worst post Mother’s Day loss, off 2.38%.

# Group Breadth Improving From a Record Low Base

&gt; After a disastrous late February and early March period, breadth among S&amp;P 500 groups cratered to the point where not a single one of the S&amp;P 500's 24 industry groups were above their 50-day moving average. Before the most recent occurrence, that's something we hadn't seen since early 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA.png))**

&gt; While there have been numerous instances in the last few years where every industry group was below its 50-DMA, the most recent period was unique in that it lasted more than four full weeks (21 trading days). Going all the way back to 1990, there has only been one other period where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average for as long as it just was. That was during the depths of the financial crisis in the 21-day stretch ending 11/3/08. It took a bear market of more than a year to finally reach that level back then, but this time around, it took less than two months. Besides that period, there has never been another four-week stretch where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA-Streaks.png))**

&gt; Overall breadth readings have already improved in terms of industry groups above their 50-day moving averages, but at this point, the number of industry groups with rising 50-day moving averages remains extremely depressed at just 8.3% as of midday Friday. Similar to the streak above, during the most recent period every group had a declining 50-day moving average for 26 straight days, and that was also the longest such streak since 2008. Granted, this is a lagging indicator and should improve the longer equities remain around current levels, but it once again serves as a reminder of how steep the declines actually were.

# Sector Relative Strength

&gt; Although the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is down around 1% over the past week, there are two sectors that have made a push higher: Communication Services (XLC) and Technology (XLK). While these moves have left both sectors in overbought territory, a snapshot from our Trend Analyzer tool shows that Tech's rally has brought it into the green YTD.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050720-TA.png))**

&gt; Technology's outperformance is nothing new. As shown in the relative strength charts from our Sector Snapshot below, Technology has been a serial outperformer versus the S&amp;P 500 for pretty much all of the past year (a rising line indicates outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 and vice versa). As for the other sectors, Health Care has also seen some drastic outperformance over the past few months. Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary have also seen some outperformance in recent weeks. Contrary to Technology, Energy, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all been consistent underperformers over the past year.

# Performance on Earnings Days

&gt; Roughly 1,300 companies have reported since the start of earnings season on 4/13 when the first of the big banks kicked things off. For those stocks that have beaten EPS estimates, the reaction has not been as strong as past years with just a 9 bps difference between this earnings season and all seasons since 2001. On the other hand, those that have missed EPS have not been as badly punished dropping 0.86% compared to an average drop of 3.56% since 2001. For all stocks, the average gain of 0.79% this earnings season is much stronger than the 0.06% gain of all other seasons.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-4.png))**

&gt; With stock price reactions being generally positive this season, most of the gain has come at the open. Stocks reporting earnings have gapped up an average of 1.24%. But intraday they have tended to sell-off, averaging a 0.44% decline from open to close.

So you’ve scoured the troves of company information looking for a diamond in the rough. You find it. It’s an obscure company that been around for decades. It has a microscopic debt to equity ratio. It has shown double digit y/y growth every quarter. It has an EPS of 5 quadrillion and and P/E that makes it too good to pass up. In addition it seems like the economic trends will help this company to grow even faster in the future and increase profit margins. 

So of course, you invest. You hold it for a year and do you know how much money you’ve made? Zero, nada, nothing. Why? Because the company doesn’t pay dividends and the stock is worth only what other people say it’s worth. In other words, finding an obscure diamond in the rough only pays off if other people find it too. Believe it or not you want Kramer saying how good a buy it is. The more the merrier. You don’t win by outsmarting the market. 

**You need to be exactly as dumb as everyone else, you just need to be faster**

So how do you win? By investing in meme stocks of course. Don’t denigrate the meme stocks. Don’t look down on them. Don’t think, has everyone lost their damn minds? No. Instead go in on meme stocks, just make damn sure that you’re early. And keep in mind that you don’t want to be there when people figure out that they aren’t really that great. So don’t be afraid to take profits. Even if it means leaving some potential on the floor. Buy early.

I get asked pretty frequently why I include the number of outstanding shares and how it is relevant for day trading stocks. I wanted to make this post to explain the importance of it and share how I use it in my own trading. Hopefully after reading this you'll see why I share this data on my watchlists and you'll check for this number before each of your trades because it can be very beneficial and is a simple way to help manage your risk in the market.

*Let's start with the obvious question you may have... what are outstanding shares?*

The number of **outstanding shares** is simply the total number of shares a publicly traded company has. This includes the shares that you and I can trade as retail traders, the shares that are traded and held by institutions/hedge funds/banks, and even the shares that are owned by company insiders. Anyone can very easily look up the number of outstanding shares a company has. You can do this in your trading platform, on websites like [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or [finviz](https://finviz.com/), or you can look into the company's most recent earnings report and see the number directly from their [SEC filings](https://www.bamsec.com/). The screenshot below shows where the number of outstanding shares is located for $AAPL in the thinkorswim mobile platform on the right shows the same number located on the first page of $AAPL's most recent earnings report filing. You'll find this info in the same location for any spot, $AAPL was just use for this example.

[https://imgur.com/a/cTAkHue](https://imgur.com/a/cTAkHue) 

Outstanding shares differs slightly from a stock's float, but the way that they affect the stock can go hand in hand. A stock's **float** is the number of shares available to be traded by the public, like you and I. You can find a stock's float by subtracting the total number of closely held shares *(by company insiders, employees, etc.)* from the total number of outstanding shares. Although traders seem to talk more about a stock's float than the number of outstanding shares, I personally like to focus more on the outstanding shares because it can be difficult to find accurate float data in a limited amount of time.

The reason for that is because a company does not directly state their float data in their SEC filings like they do their outstanding shares. This means that in order to get accurate float data, you have to research and find the number of closely held shares by digging through filings and then subtract that number from the total number of outstanding shares. You can look for a stock's float on 3 different websites like [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [finviz](https://finviz.com/), and [marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/) and many times you'll end up with 3 completely different numbers.

The number of outstanding shares may be more commonly used for calculating a company's market capitalization, but it's definitely a valuable number for short-term trading as well. This number can be thought of as the **supply**, and the volume for the stock can be thought of as the **demand**. When there is a low supply *(in this case meaning a low float or low amount of shares outstanding)* and high demand, generally there will be a larger amount of volatility in that stock compared to one with a larger supply.

For example, you can look at the number of shares outstanding for stocks with the largest % gain on any given day, and you will find that a large majority of them have less than 100 million shares outstanding. Now, 100 million isn't a magical number for picking big runners, but stock's with many more shares outstanding than that tend to have less volatility and less potential for huge runs in my experience. In fact, if you look back on the biggest supernovas from the past few years, you'll notice that they all had under 100 million shares outstanding, and many of them even having less than 10 million shares. In the screenshot below you can see the huge spike in the stock **$DRYS** from 2017 when it went from under $5 to over $100 in just a few days. Since then $DRYS has done many reverse splits and offerings, but at the time it had a very low float of only around 1 million shares.

[https://imgur.com/a/H3gEdyq](https://imgur.com/a/H3gEdyq) 

As you can see, volatility doesn't just work on the upside though. $DRYS, like many big runners, came down just as quickly as it went up. That's why trading low floats with higher volatility can create a higher risk, higher reward situation. With that being said, one of the ways I use the number of outstanding shares is to give myself an idea of the stock's expected volatility. If it has a low supply, I most likely will trade a smaller-than-usual position size to **reduce my risk** in the trade that is expected to be highly volatile.

In my opinion, this is especially important with longer-term trades and investments. Generally the goal of an investment is to profit from a slow and steady rise over a long period of time. If you're investing in stocks with a low number of outstanding shares, you'll most likely have to deal with much more volatility and larger drawdowns in your positions. Aside from the dilution, poor financials, and frequent pump and dumps, this is one of the reasons that penny stocks do **not** make good investments, even though they can be great for short-term trading and scalping.",False,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,407261,public,confidence,self,Outstanding Shares and Stock Floats,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ggj94a/outstanding_shares_and_stock_floats/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'c-359Gge1zV9hb-IOPrkkb4wPYmWpWz8z1JDgbA5lEI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 70, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fDtJC6mpZiI-wggGaJpsibC9um2740yeK_tRcpEGRLw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8c29a9950c875eecf7c982ad35a9a1673bae7b7', 'width': 108}, {'height': 141, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fDtJC6mpZiI-wggGaJpsibC9um2740yeK_tRcpEGRLw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cbcd8a3cfcd89dac64f07ba0180f97d99143359', 'width': 216}, {'height': 208, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fDtJC6mpZiI-wggGaJpsibC9um2740yeK_tRcpEGRLw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0b6981011ffb5dc1c023ede3c18586f831d026e', 'width': 320}, {'height': 417, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fDtJC6mpZiI-wggGaJpsibC9um2740yeK_tRcpEGRLw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8abfbe6b6f22d76a7b113cf510a49774b1a771fd', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 546, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fDtJC6mpZiI-wggGaJpsibC9um2740yeK_tRcpEGRLw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=61cf17d1a2ee0ae46e6df990eb2c0c3861b6cfef', 'width': 836}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of those businesses, a staggering 96 percent failed to comply with all of the Open Texas guidelines. The shoppers observed that restaurants were more likely to comply with some requirements, like separating tables and asking employees to wear masks, than they were with guidelines like offering single use condiments or contactless payment."" Definitely check out the full study. 

**If this trend continues as states reopen, it's bad news for the economy.**  

To mostly everyone, these staggering unemployment numbers don't feel real yet. People think this pandemic is just going to blow right over, and life is just weeks away from returning to normal. Optimism is especially high because those $1,200 stimulus checks are three times the amount of cash over 40% of American's have in their savings account on any given day. Plus, Unemployment is paying millions of people more than they regularly make at their jobs. A very large portion of Americans probably feel more ""financially secure"" right now than any other time in recent memory.

People are ready to return to normal, and the market is reflecting that. We saw it in economic activity this last week with all the reopenings. However,  The fact of the matter is a virus with a .5%-1% death rate is spreading rapidly, and it's going to have to infect 220,000,000 Americans before it stops, unless we stop it first. That's 1 person in every 10th family (assuming each family has 16 people across 3-4 generations) . This virus also does permanent damage to the lungs, heart, kidneys, and/or the central nervous system in 20% of cases, and will require lifetime treatment (1 in every 2 families). 

We dont have adequate testing, not enough people are wearing masks, and Mark Cuban's study in Dallas showed less than 4% of businesses were following every public health guideline in their reopened economy. The longer people take to realize what's going on and react accordingly, the harder the economy is going to crash when they do.

First lets compare ivesting in index funds compare to investing in big, credible companies with a buy and hold strategy ie apple, tesla, amazon all of them has a high growth rate beat index funds by a large margin with low amount of risk since these company most likely wont go down by any means. 
Second the reason most go for index funds for its low risk but as far as i know bank saving account hold a 6.6 to even 8% with no taxes and less risk than index funds so whats the point of it ( i live in vietnam and this is a reference to vietnamese banks ) .

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehaman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. The Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailout Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

Other elite universities, such as Princeton, Stanford and Yale also announced that they would not be taking the money designated to them through a $14 billion federal aid package for higher education. The money was part of a $2 trillion relief package that President Trump signed into law on March 27th.

This criticism centred around the endowment size of the elite US universities:

**Harvard has an Endowment of $40.9 billion, the largest in the world.** 

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.9 billion to the university, representing 35% of Harvard's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, the largest allocation was to hedge funds, which returned 5.5% 

Followed by public equity, which returned 5.9%

Followed by private equity, which returned 16%

&amp;#x200B;

**Yale,** [**thanks to David Swensen**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-09-11/david-swensen-made-yale-fabulously-rich-and-changed-endowments)**, has an Endowment of $30.3 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.4 billion to Yale, 33% of Yale's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, Yale is currently targeting a 30% allocation of the endowment to market-insensitive assets (cash, bonds, and absolute return). Absolute return just refers to value-driven and event-driven hedging strategies such as long/short equity, distressed investment and special situation investment. They are designed to have lower volatility over time.

It also seeks to target a 53.5% allocation to illiquid assets such as venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, and natural resources.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stanford has an Endowment of $27.7 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.3 billion to the university, representing 22% of Stanford's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, it is mainly Private Equity, Absolute Return and International Equity. 

Private Equity refers to investments in private companies, ranging from startups all the way up to leveraged buyouts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Princeton has an Endowment of $26.1 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.4 billion to the university, a massive 64% of Yale's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, it is mainly Private Equity, Real Assets and Independent Return.

Real Assets refers to real estate and natural resources, and Independent Return refers to hedge funds or, in superior Ivy League speak, investment vehicles that seek high absolute returns that are typically independent of broad market trends.

&amp;#x200B;

**According to Henry Hansmann, Professor Emeritus of Law at Yale Law School,** 

**""a stranger from Mars who looks at private universities would probably say they are institutions whose business is to run large pools of investment assets and that they run educational institutions on the side that can expand and contract to act as buffers for investment pools.""**

&amp;#x200B;

As well as this, many top US universities were [implicated in the Paradise Papers](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/08/us-universities-offshore-funds-endowments-fossil-fuels-paradise-papers) for using offshore funds to grow their endowments.

104 US universities and colleges were named in data from the law firm Appleby, with four of the top 10 schools by endowment named in the files: Columbia, Princeton, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania.

Most contentiously, some of the offshore funds invested in carbon-polluting industries, despite leading US universities playing a key role in the fight against climate change...

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at an example:

In July 2016, Northeastern University [announced that it would invest $25m of its endowment in clean energy and renewables](https://news.northeastern.edu/2016/07/11/northeastern-to-invest-25-million-of-endowment-funds-in-environmental-sustainability/), boasting that the institution was ""a recognised leader in sustainability practices”.

In April 2017, Northeastern [invited Elizabeth Warren to open its new $225m Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex](https://www.wbur.org/edify/2017/04/03/northeastern-celebrates-grand-opening-of-225-million-science-facility).

However, despite the complex’s ideals and goals, which include seeking solutions to rising sea levels and pollution, Northeastern was one of 12 prominent US universities and colleges named in the Paradise Papers as investors in a hedge fund based in the Cayman Islands. The fund is a feeder to a subsidiary based in Houston, Texas, of EnCap Investments, a company that, since 1988, has pumped almost $20bn into oil and shale gas exploration and production.

&amp;#x200B;

Now back to Harvard.

With such a massive endowment, some have claimed that the school [should use more of the fund to entirely eliminate tuition.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/a-push-to-make-harvard-free-also-questions-the-role-of-race-in-admissions.html?referer=&amp;amp;_r=1)

Others have argued that Harvard’s funds could be better used by [recruiting and educating more low-income students, rather than giving free education to their already relatively well-off student body](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-problem-with-making-harvard-free-2016-01-17).

Harvard clapped back. 

[In their 2018-2019 financial report](https://finance.harvard.edu/annual-report), they stressed that the endowment does not give the school full financial freedom.

""There is a common misconception that endowments, including Harvard's, can be accessed like bank accounts, used for anything at any time as long as funds are available. In reality, Harvard's flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it is designed to last forever, which is crucial for an institution intended to serve generations of students and pursue research on big questions - questions that cannot be answered in one lifetime.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 [axed the tax-exempt status of university endowments, imposing a 1.4 percent tax](https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Treasury-Department-Releases-Endowment-Tax-Draft-Rules.aspx) on realised income of universities whose investment assets top $500,000 per student. The IRS anticipates that about 25 to 40 institutions will fall under this definition. 

Stanford are expected to face a $43 million tax bill, and Harvard are expecting a $50 million bill.

What are your thoughts on the endowment situation: are they just asset management firms with schools attached?

**Weekly**
ichimoku cloud is healthy but the tenkan i below the kijun, which mean that it’s a negative market. however tenkan is climbing up to meet kijun meaning a bounce to longe term bullish market can be set in stone. sinkou clouds are healthy green, while chikou cloud is above the candlesticks. we have a resistance line set to ~$340. EMAs are good. 14 and 25 are tight. the 14 day is close enough to candlesticks not to break meaning it can have a swift turn around or supported strength to go higher. RSI is at a 60.00 points, and moving in positive trend direction. MACD growing from negative to positive, currently sitting at -1.09, beginning to form a positive relationship. has potential op passing ATH at 325.00. doesn’t seem like a fight will occur at that level. no intel other than ATH drop and and advanced block which could occur. reduction in volume going back to natural levels.


**Daily**
two main trend lines which are both support systems. MACD starting to reach its previous high(market correction imminent?), with RSI being at a healthy 60.00. both indicators moving in a positive direction. RSI has a 1 week straight RSI line-looking at a small correction maybe occurring( 2-3 days? MACD staying a little longer). 50 EMA passing under both 25 and 14. good news!! Ichimoku cloud beginning to form positive Sinkou cloud, and kijun passing over Sinkou B cloud. Chikou is above and healthy. Sticks getting ahead of tenkan cloud(small correction coming?)


**4hour**
everything as healthy as stated above. confirmation of correction. RSI at high of 67.35. MACD fast at 7.67. room to increase but not for a long period. Ichimoku cloud healthy and up trending. EMA healthy and uptrending. candlestick getting ahead of Tenkan. imminent correction.


330 resistance prominent on monthly chart. After, which 360.


My take. a bullish run is likely to occur long term, but im a bit skeptical as to how fast it goes up. especially between 330 and 340  which is a month trendline(resistance). a short correction will occur, daily 20 RSI line is too straight for my likening. with confirmation from 4hour 20 RSI heading higher and reaching peak 70. if it heads to 80+(4hour chart) then i see slightly bigger than expected correction, take that and add dividends. but stocks only go up. I don’t see dividends really affecting market as much not cause of fed pump, but in last 4 dividends only 1 was welcomed with a drop which it then picked up from a few days later.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,406479,public,confidence,self,TA of AAPL,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gfzjo9/ta_of_aapl/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To recap how this week went in the stock market, here’s just the tip of the iceberg:

* Elon Musk tweeted “TSLA stock too high imo”
* Talks about reopening the economy are becoming more political than necessary
* Disney reported bad earnings, announces halt of dividend payments to recoup losses
* Giant hornets seem like a bigger problem than the virus
* Unemployment rates are reaching towards 15%

However, the stock market is still rising, and stocks are even reaching back to their all-time highs. Why, or how can this even happen?

The truth of the matter is that nobody knows. Markets can be bipolar sometimes (especially during uncertain times), and it just appears that it's become one of those times again. Yes, usually the stock market fluctuates up or down depending on good or bad news.

However, the smart investor knows that it's only a matter of time before things start to collapse. An even smarter investor would not even care if a crash or a recession would occur, simply for the fact that they follow a strict regimen of investing a set amount of money in the stock market per week, allocating to different stocks, bonds, and the like, and slowly building up their portfolio over YEARS, not just for a couple of months.

I'd say, the best investor right now is an investor that buys companies that have certain value in a time where value appears to be irrelevant. In my opinion, companies like Disney, Apple, and Tesla have extraordinary potential for several years to come, which is when this pandemic will clear up, and the economy functions back to normal again.

The best judgment, and the final piece of advice I will share, is to consistently dollar-cost average your shares on a weekly (or even daily) basis. In situations like these, you should buy in small increments to level out the average price of each stock. This protects you in the event of the stock price dropping further and prevents those huge (50%+) losses that we see on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Beyond meat, valued at $ 7.2 billion, was sometimes one of Wall Street's hottest stocks, but also one of the most volatile since the initial public offering in May 2019.

Jobs report due out this morning, expecting to have a double-digit unemployment level for the first time since the great depression.

The market is in great shape, it's doesn't seem to be bothered by any of the bad news for main street. The NASDAQ is actually flat for the year right now.

The economy which appears to have no correlation to the market is in terrible shape. Record high unemployment, massive closings of small businesses across the country. Long lines at food banks.

Gold is ticking up and Bitcoin has been surging the past few days. Famous hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones announced a position in Bitcoin yesterday comparing it to gold in the '70s. With halving less than a week away I'm keeping an eye on the key resistance $10,500 level.

The **VIX** is low and futures are up. I'm still bullish for the day.

**Watchlist:**

**EMKR** is a low float earning play, resistance level around $3.50

**PRTS** is a lowish float earning play, watching for a continuation

**LIVX** is a lowish float moving on news, watching for a setup above $3.60

**VUZI** is a lowish float that surged on news yesterday, on watch today.

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with—American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.■",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,406052,public,confidence,self,"The Economist, May 7 2020 edition: A dangerous gap.

I want to teach valuation in a way that does not seem overwhelming so the average investor really understands what intrinsic value is, and to cement the idea that buying a stock is like buying a piece of a business.

The hope is to build a email subscriber following who would then be willing to pay a small monthly subscription (maybe $10-$30) a month for access to my personal valuation of companies. I'm thinking every other day, or if it has a big enough following then everyday. 

The strategy here is that by teaching valuation first, and walking subscribers through my process first, that it builds credibility and trust in my knowledge. I think that is the most important thing. I don't claim to be a financial advisor or for them to go and act on my valuations, as all models have underlying assumptions and forecasting.

I'll make this quick and start off by saying I'm a rookie with regard to the stock market but have done my fair share of research into smaller / ""off the radar"" companies poised with interesting opportunities and lucrative potential.

I was first introduced to **NEXCF** right before their big blastoff breakout, 52-week high price after news of their launch of 3D augmented reality (3D/AR) solution for online eCommerce product placement advertising.

The CEO of the company seems to have always been, most especially in recent weeks, an active member of the shareholder community and stands behind his brand. There have been plenty of online press releases detailing his investments and purchases of company shares -- and just recently purchasing nearly one million shares himself -- so buying his own stuff means things are going well and he's pretty confident about it, right? He also regularly hosts online video conference calls where he welcomes investors and speculators to come in and chat, watch the show and ask questions -- all done in live action! I feel like he's always been very transparent with his company practices and future plans -- which has lead me to be a firm believer of **NEXCF**.

Not to mention, although **NEXCF** is labeled as having OTC shares, their reputation precedes themselves by openly reporting acquisitions, partnerships, revenues, profits, etc.

Also looks like volume and share price have been going up somewhat steadily in recent weeks.

The main one I wanted wasn't public so I did a little research, found Regis Salons and Ulta. I read Ulta is opening nearly 200 stores on Monday. Regis is selling for $4 more than when I started thinking about it.

**CBRE (PE: 10x)**

CBRE is a major international provider of real estate services and related investments. The stock price took a big hit during the real estate crisis in 2008, but it’s has been climbing back since then. The company has shown consistent earnings growth in recent years. Revenues were up 12% from 2018 to 2019.

Analysts were predicting more growth for the coming years, but the impact from the recent coronavirus scare is not yet clear. Another financial crisis would be a serious headwind to revenues (CBRE would see far less transaction activity), but the PE ratio suggests a tantalizing purchase if coronavirus does not cause prolonged pain to the US real estate market.

**AAPL (PE: 24x)**

Apple went public in 1980. It took off with the iPod in 2001 and really made its mark with the first iPhone in 2007. The price has fallen with the recent market disruptions. It’s still down from its recent peak of $325 to $300 now.

With Apple stock making investors happy for over a decade, this might be a compelling price for them to make new investments. The PE ratio is actually right now somewhat above the median for real economy stocks, but that’s low for a tech company that is still generally in expansion mode, and especially low for a tech company with such brand recognition.

**DAL (PE: 4x)**

Invest at your own risk.

Delta Airlines was showing healthy profitability since 2016 until the quarter ended in March. 2016 was the same year that famed value investor Warren Buffett, who once famously eschewed all airline stocks, started to pick up Delta shares himself. Before the coronavirus, people were more confident about their economic situation and travelling more in a growing economy. However, the coronavirus changed all that. Delta swung to a loss in the first quarter, and the second quarter will likely be worse. Warren Buffet sold all his airline shares in April.

For these reasons, the PE ratio is so low at 4x (a trailing figure based based on 2019 earnings).

To support employment in the industry, the US Treasury department allotted billions of dollars to airlines, including about $5 billion for Delta.

**ORCL (PE: 16x)**

Oracle is a tech stock that has a very low P/E ratio. Stock price performance has been consistent since the 2001 recession. Oracle is benefitting from the transition to cloud computing and is likely a fairly safe buy for the long term.

**RHI (12x)**

Robert Half provides staffing and risk consulting services in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. An economic downturn will reduce hiring and thus demand for Robert Half’s staffing services. But if you have a long-term horizon you may want to take a second look.

**HD (22x)**

Home Depot is often used as a case study for great financial management of a company. It was showing consistent strong earnings performance.

But after the recent market crash, the stock was down big. It is back with a vengeance though; It is up 50% in price from its low in March, and 10% since [we highlighted the stock on our Instagram page on April 20th](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NaV-SHB_-/).

Disclaimer: I hold HD, ORCL and AAPL.

I've been long term investing spread out, bought more during the pandemic and didn't sell. I have a handful of stocks that have doubled, tripled, but I of course only have like 1-5 shares of the stock.

I wanna grow wealth, I have a simple job without much future ahead of it. I feel like if I sold all my stocks and started investing large sums, even with meager returns I'd still be generating more money than my favorite stocks that have doubled.

I guess it's just basic math, investing more will return (and lose) more vs having a thin spread over so many things.

I don't really feel like a lot of tech stocks will survive in the long term, I don't feel like a lot of the old staples will continue to last either. I enjoy my dividend stocks but I think overall this year I'd make about 300 total which is good and all. But I'm just conflicted on what I want to do.

A thin spread over a large area?
Or a large chunk at a few select stocks I see value in.

At least eight brokerages raised their price targets on the stock. Mizuho made the most bullish brokerage, raising its target by $55 to $180.

The company reported first-quarter revenue of $364.9 million, well above the average market estimate of $331.3 million. It also forecast current-quarter revenue of $365 million to $370 million, above expectations of $336.9 million.

**My thoughts**

The article mentions that demand from its top customers declined in the quarter (Lyft, Uber, AirBnB) but it was offset by increased use from education, healthcare and food delivery companies. If things ease up and some of their bigger customers return, could we see their price climbing even higher? Mid long bet perhaps? They also seem optimistic about long term growth in health care around video APIs leading that growth in the future.

Here's the company bio for those that aren't as familiar with Twilio. **I sourced this from Beeken io**

Twilio, Inc. engages in the development of communications software, cloud-based platform, and services. Its platform consists of the following layers: engagement cloud, programmable communications cloud, and super network. The engagement cloud software addresses use cases like account security and contact centers and is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that handles the higher-level communication logic needed for nearly every type of customer engagement. The Programmable communications cloud software is a set of APIs that enables developers to embed voice, messaging, and video capabilities into their applications. The super network is a software layer that allows customers' software to communicate with connected devices globally. The company was founded by John Wolthuis, Jeffery G. Lawson, and Evan Cooke in March 2008 and is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,405382,public,confidence,self,TWLO | Twilio shares surge 32% after results crush Wall Street estimates,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gf8bgk/twlo_twilio_shares_surge_32_after_results_crush/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One afternoon, Pepe went for a walk and he felt thirsty; When he returned home, he opened a bottle of wine, and while he was drinking wine, he realized something,

something that nobody had ever realized: there were no bars in the village, not a single bar. Pepe thought that if he opened a bar, he could make others happy by pouring them drinks,

and that he could even make some money.

&amp;#x200B;

He felt happy with the idea of opening a bar. That afternoon, his friend Moncho dropped by his place and gave him a great name for the bar, and everyone knows that when an idea gets a name, it begins to take off.

&amp;#x200B;

Pepe made a list of what he needed to open the first bar in the village, he realized he needed to buy tables, chairs, glasses, paint and a tethering post so his clients could tie up their horses and get into the bar; He did the math, and all of that should cost him around 10,000 coins. Of course Pepe didn't have 10,000 coins, because he was poor, but overnight he devised a way to get those 10,000 coins.

&amp;#x200B;

He cut a thousand little pieces of paper, and he wrote on each one of them ""Coming soon: Pepe's Bar.""

He wrote that a thousand times. The following Sunday, after mass, he went to the village square in his best suit, and he told everyone there:

&amp;#x200B;

""Dear neighbors, I'm opening a bar in the outskirts of the village.""

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody looked at him. Some said, ""Great idea!"". Pepe felt very happy with everyone's attention, and then he showed the thousand pieces of paper in his hand and said

&amp;#x200B;

\- This is important dear reader -

&amp;#x200B;

Pepe said, ""Each one of these little papers costs 10 coins.""; The neighbors looked at him. ""The person who buys one of these has to keep it because in one month, when I open my bar,

I'll pay 12 coins for each little paper you give back to me."" There were whispers all over the square.

Moncho, who was the village fool, asked, 

&amp;#x200B;

""Wait Pepe! The little pieces of paper only cost 10 coins. Why would you give away two extra coins?""

&amp;#x200B;

Pepe said, ""It's not a giveaway, it is compensation. I'll compensate with two extra coins those who help me accomplish my dream of opening a bar.""

&amp;#x200B;

The mayor came up front and said, ""It makes perfect sense! Well done, Pepe!""

Ernesto, who was rich and knew about business, said, ""I think it's a great idea.""

Father Ricardo, while pulling some coins from underneath his cassock, said, ""That's a very Christian idea! I want some of your little papers.""

&amp;#x200B;

And everybody started buying Pepe's little papers. In such a simple way and in only one morning, Pepe got the money to open his bar. Pepe sold all 1,000 little papers among all neighbors.

&amp;#x200B;

""I bought two,"" said Sabino, who was poor but optimistic.

""I bought 36,"" shouted Quique, who was greedy and arrogant.

&amp;#x200B;

Pepe returned home with 10,000 coins in his backpack and fell asleep thinking about his dream of opening a bar.

The following day was a Monday, and Pepe traveled to town and bought wood to build a counter and bought some paint. He went back home and started working. He didn't set foot in the village square for the following four weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

That Monday, the square was very crowded, much more than on an ordinary Monday. Many neighbors had spent the whole night cutting their own little papers because they had also realized that they had projects that they couldn't accomplish due to a lack of coins. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some little papers said, ""Coming soon: Horacio's ice cream parlor.""

&amp;#x200B;

Other little papers said, ""Soon: Carmen's beauty salon.""

&amp;#x200B;

And there were even little papers written by Moncho, with misspellings, that said, ""By the end of the month, I'll get you to the Moon.""

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, people were climbing the streetlights so that other people could buy their little papers. They were climbing the water fountain to trade little papers for coins.

Tuesday was even worse, and on Wednesday, it was so crowded that it was impossible to walk on the village square.

The mayor, in order to keep order, had to facilitate a space in the Town Hall for the neighbors to gather and exchange the papers without destroying the square. That place was inaugurated Thursday and was given the name of ""The Little Papers Hall.""

&amp;#x200B;

So by Friday, everyone who had a project had obtained the necessary coins, and they had started working. Horacio was buying milk, cream and ice for his ice cream parlor. Pepe was sawing wood for his bar. Carmen was sharpening scissors for her upcoming beauty salon, and Moncho had bought two skinny horses to get people to the Moon.

&amp;#x200B;

In The Little Papers Hall there was only a group of neighbors left, the ones who had never thought about any interesting projects. The only thing these neighbors had were little papers made by other people. One of them, Ramón, complained out loud

&amp;#x200B;

""Geez!"" he said, Now I need coins for cigarettes, and I don't have any. A few days ago, I traded my last 10 coins for a little paper, and now I need to smoke."" 

""Same with me,"" said Luis. ""I want to go see a movie, but I can't.""

&amp;#x200B;

The complaints were getting louder until Sabino, who was clever, held his little paper in the air, and he said, 

&amp;#x200B;

""Let's see, [guys.In](https://guys.In) three weeks, Pepe will pay 12 coins to whomever has this paper that I bought for 10 coins. I'm selling my little paper for eight coins right now!""

Everyone looked at him and said, ""Oh!"" ""It's a deal!"" said Ernesto, who was rich but wanted to be richer, and he snatched the little paper from his hands for eight coins.

Ramón and Luis also sold their little papers for less than 10 coins, and while one went looking for cigarettes and the other to the cinema, the other neighbors saw that this was a new way of doing business even though they had never come up with an original idea. Some of them got on the chairs and tables. They started offering all they had, and even Father Ricardo came sad from the church and said,

&amp;#x200B;

""Dear friends, when Moncho was selling his little papers, I, as a good Christian, bought a few because he's a fool. Now, Moncho is selling them for 7 coins, and he says he'll repay 20 coins. But he's a fool, and he wants to get people to the Moon. I now need coins to fix the belfry, and nobody wants to buy his little papers.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry, Father Ricardo,"" everybody said, ""we can't buy them. That guy's never going to the Moon.""

&amp;#x200B;

So the downcast priest left with Moncho's little papers. That was the first time in many years that nobody would help him fix the church.

And so the first week went on...

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*second week\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Pepe's house no longer looked like a house, it looked like something else. There was a wooden bar in the dining room. The bathroom was divided in two: one for ladies and one for gentlemen. The walls were half painted in navy blue, and Pepe was thrilled with his progress.

Since Pepe hadn't been to the village yet, he didn't know that everyone's life had turned into a huge mess, with little papers coming and going with different prices and owners. Even the mayor, after talking to his assistant, decided to jump on board.

One Tuesday morning, the mayor spoke from the balcony with a megaphone

&amp;#x200B;

""Neighbors, the square was destroyed during the little papers' frenzy. I need to raise funds to repair the damaged streetlights, to repair the water fountain and to buy me a motorcar. From now on, I'm selling 1,000 government little papers.""

""How many coins?"" asked Sabino.

""No coins!"" said the mayor,

""My little papers cost one horse. When the water fountain and the streetlights are fixed, and I have bought me a motorcar, I'll pay two horses for each little paper. The government little papers are now for sale. Buy them before it's too late!""

&amp;#x200B;

The mayor's little papers sold out in record time. Everybody in the village gave their horses to the mayor, and from that day on, all the chores were done on foot. In the meanwhile, the trading of little papers was still rising, and there weren't enough pencils to write down who owned what. Some little papers were very sought out, like Pepe's, who worked day and night building his bar.

But other little papers were unwanted, like Moncho's, because his device for getting people to the Moon, for the moment, was only a wagon and two horses. Nobody believed that it'd ever take off.

Ernesto, the rich neighbor who had bought many little papers during the first week, now wanted to get rid of Moncho's little papers. Since he also had Pepe's little papers,

he came up with a great idea that he called ""Ernesto's packages."" These were packages with 100 little papers of all colors. For example, there were 10 of Pepe's little papers on top, 20 Horacio's ice cream parlor little papers in the middle and 70 little papers of Moncho's lunar project at the bottom, where nobody would see them.

&amp;#x200B;

By the following Thursday, Ernesto's packages were a huge hit among the neighbors who madly sought out Pepe's little papers or the mayor's. But Friday, Quique found out about the scam and said:

&amp;#x200B;

""Beware! Be careful, neighbors! Ernesto's packages sometimes have Pepe's little papers or the mayor's on top and that's fine, but at the bottom there's plenty of Moncho's papers,

and that guy is never ever going to get anybody to the Moon. So before you buy his package, seek my advice. I charge two coins for each piece of advice.""

&amp;#x200B;

From that moment on, every buyer consulted Quique before buying any package from Ernesto. Ernesto and Quique, who had been friends for many years, never spoke to each other again.

This is what went on the second week.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*third week started\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the projects were almost completed, while others were just getting started. Pepe's just needed to nail the tethering post so the horses could rest outside the bar. Horacio had managed to blend milk and fruits for the ice cream, and just needed to bring ice blocks from town. But Carmen was still looking for a nice venue for her beauty salon although she had dozens of sharpened scissors.

&amp;#x200B;

And what can we say about poor Moncho? His horses looked sadder and skinnier, no matter how much he brushed them. It didn't look like his device would fly anytime soon.

The neighbors that had Moncho's and Carmen's little papers were nervous, and they couldn't sell them to anybody until Quique came up with a great idea. He said:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey! If you still have Moncho's little papers, don't worry. I can sell you 'Quique's Peace of Mind' for those little papers.""

""What's that?"" asked Sabino, who had a lot of Moncho's little papers.

""Very easy,"" said Quique.

""If you have Moncho's little papers, you pay me two coins every night until the end of the month, and if Moncho can't get people to the Moon, I'll pay the 20 coins Moncho promised.""

""Even if he fails?"" asked everyone.

""Even if he fails!"" said Quique.

""Great idea!"" said Sabino.

""That way we'll feel much safer, and we can buy more little papers from the village fool.""

""That's why I call it Quique's Peace of Mind,"" said Quique.

&amp;#x200B;

And many neighbors began to pay Quique two coins every night to insure Moncho's project. Caught up in the frenzy of these new ideas, no one in the village realized that the mayor had neither fixed the streetlights nor the water fountain. He had only kept one part of his promisehe had fled the village in a motorcar.

That's all he'd done. And the only horses left in the village were Moncho's. The mayor had taken all the other horses.

The assistant, the mayor's right hand, who knew all about the scam all along, decided that nobody should know that his boss had left. And his idea was magnificenthe brought a blackboard into the Little Papers Hall, and he started grading each project from one to ten. He gave an eight to Pepe's Bar, a five to Carmen's beauty salon, and a seven to Horacio's ice cream parlor. He gave a two to Moncho's Moon vehicle and, as if it was no big deal, he gave a 9.5 to the mayor's village square renewal project.

&amp;#x200B;

""What are those numbers?"" asked Sabino.

The assistant said, ""Those are the probabilities of completion of each project.

It's for you. I'm only trying to help.""

&amp;#x200B;

This was what went on the third week.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*fourth week\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

When the fourth week came along, and the month went by, Pepe got up very early, and he peacefully walked to the village. From a distance, you could see his bar facade shining with the brand new luminous sign. The bar was called ""The Moon,"" as Moncho had suggested. Now he only had to wait for the neighbors to arrive, dying for a drink.

Pepe walked the 10 miles to the village, nailing signs to every tree beside the road ""The Moon Bar. Open every night."" Each time he nailed a sign, he would move back

and stand proud staring at the sign.

However, when he got to the village square, he couldn't figure out what was going on. He thought he had made a wrong turn, and that he was in a different village. It looked like a war had broken out. The streetlights and the fountain had been destroyed. There were no horses in the streets. The neighbors were walking in circles talking to themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

""What happened?"" Pepe asked Horacio as soon as he saw him.

""Oh! Pepe!"" said Horacio crying,

""Oh, Pepe. Everybody went crazy with the little papers, with mine, Carmen's, yours, everyone's. All of a sudden, there were more little papers than coins. The mayor ran away. Later on, there were no more coins. Then the horses disappeared. The guys selling Ernesto's packages went broke. Quique's Peace of Mind resellers couldn't pay anyone, so they ran away during the night. We are ruined, Pepe.""

""And your ice cream project?"" asked Pepe,

""What about Carmen's beauty salon?""

""My project was a fiasco,"" said Horacio,

""There are no horses to go to town for ice, so the ice cream melts. Carmen doesn't have any customers. Everybody is pulling their own hair out. No one needs a haircut.""

&amp;#x200B;

Pepe was speechless. He couldn't believe what he'd heard. Then Horacio said:

""Dear God, I need a drink.""

And Luis said, ""Me too. My throat is dry.""

Sabino asked, ""Pepe, did you open the bar you were building or not?""

&amp;#x200B;

And many others approached him, asking about the bar.

Pepe then realized that without horses no one could ever get to his bar in the outskirts of the village. He also realized he could never repay the 10,000 coins he had borrowed. Then he saw, in the middle of the square, Moncho.

&amp;#x200B;

Moncho's two skinny horses were the only animals left, and they were pulling three wagons with two wheels each, like a train. Many neighbors were getting on the wagons, while many others were waiting in a long line. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Moncho,"" said Pepe, ""where are all these people going?""

And Moncho said, ""Where do you think?

To your bar! To The Moon.""

&amp;#x200B;

Pepe saw a sign hanging from the broken water fountain that said, ""Moncho gets you to The Moon. Departure: one coin. Return: Free.""

&amp;#x200B;

""But Moncho,"" said Pepe, ""did you know that everyone would lose their horses?""

""No,"" said Moncho, ""I only knew one thingI know anyone can ride a horse to the bar, but no one can ride it home if they're drunk. Since I don't drink, I thought I could take folks to and from The Moon.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then Pepe hugged Moncho. He got into the first wagon and shouted:

&amp;#x200B;

""Everybody to The Moon! Drinks are on the house tonight.""

&amp;#x200B;

And everybody jumped in the wagons and clapped.

&amp;#x200B;

Reader, my friend, be careful, because in the real world, the stories about Pepes who want to open bars, or the stories about Monchos who want to get people to the Moon, stories that no one understands, are almost always projects that don't have happy endings as in children's stories.

&amp;#x200B;

Because people like Quique, the mayor, Ernesto or the assistant show up, and they always ruin everything.

By no means advanced but I've recently got back into it.

I've lost a fair bit of money over the past few days. Mainly my fault, but I'm really struggling to believe a common theme among cancelling trades.

Whenever I notice a pattern or a trend and make an investment, I watch it for a while, make a trade and then suddenly it goes in the other direction. This happens all the time, it can't possibly be a coincidence.

Now I know it's not possibly, nor legal to actually change the trend of said stock, but perhaps they manipulate the rate they display to you, or a delay or something similar.

The internet advertising giants mostly say that April was better than March for the online ad market, but none of them seem to know if that trajectory will last deeper into spring.

All five companies declined to give any specific guidance for the second quarter, a sign that they are fearful that the sharp deceleration trends in March could come back, or at least in certain pockets of industry that are being hit the hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing.

Why I'm betting HUGE on $SPXL and shorting $SPXS 

American Media will slowly notice the loss in covering corona and will stop talking about it since ad revenue will dry up. 

Should see a huge uptrend within May.  By the end of May there will be no Corona news. Deaths will continue but wiped off media. 

Focus will go back to elections. 

Very strong ascending triangle is forming, and it is taking a long time which means a huge jump could be coming up. Its like a spring getting loaded. 

I am betting on a downturn still but I have a feeling I am 100% wrong. 

May 8 is Fed employment which Trump's Feds control the narrative, it will show lesser than expected unemployment which will boost the market and help with re-election. 

May 20th will see oil make huge moves up since most are thinking it's another 4/20 for oil and many short shorts holding $ERY will get caught losing their shirt when oil runs near 5/20 contract expiration. 

By June there will be almost no Corona talk.

But Uber, which operates in more markets around the world than Lyft, could recover some lost revenue with its food delivery business.

On Monday, Uber’s Middle East business Careem said it was cutting 536 jobs this week, representing 31% of the Dubai-headquartered company’s workforce.

Lyft will report its quarterly results on Wednesday after market hours and Uber is expected to report earnings on Thursday.

**My thoughts**

I've been pondering about this for a while and I'm finding it hard to think of ways where I would feel confident being in an Uber or any ride share during or even as lockdown eases. It's a tricky one, how do you get all the drivers to re-jig their cars with safety features (Plexiglas between driver and passenger? can't imagine that). I'm expecting this one to keep tanking.

The Bank of England (BoE) meets tomorrow. Having already slashed rates to almost zero and restarted QE, BoE is unlikely to do any more for now. But it will still have a tough job on its hands, as its new economic forecasts will try to estimate the depth and length of this unique recession.

Sterling's reaction though may depend mainly on the comments of the new Governor, Andrew Bailey. From a risk-management perspective, Bailey probably has more incentive to maintain a dovish tone and hint that his central bank is prepared to do much more if need be. Anything short of that could trigger a sizable rebound in sterling and a tightening of financial conditions, which the BoE likely wants to avoid.

Overall, the outlook for Sterling seems challenging. In the near term, Britain is one of the few major economies that haven’t announced an opening-up plan so far, and the longer things stay shut, the bleaker the outlook for the economy. Longer-term, Brexit worries could come back to haunt the currency, as PM Johnson insists that he won’t request an extension to the December deadline for the transition period, setting the stage for more eleventh-hour negotiations, brinkmanship, and drama ahead.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** 

Trump tones down his anti-China rhetoric, and asset markets regained the positive tone. However, while risk assets were enjoying a good day, the German courts finally delivered a ruling, in a lawsuit that started 5 years ago, that ECB’s indiscriminate bond buying is beyond its mandate. So, the German Central Bank now has to stop participating in the program unless ECB can prove in the next 3 months that the policy is delivering the monetary effects it is supposed to and not just monetising the debts of governments. 

This caused weakness in the EUR but small sell-off in risk did not last.

Cutting production was the right move to stop the market from over floating, and it's working but it takes time to use and get rid of all stored oil in tankers. This is only if all OPEC+ members kept their promise and kept the production cut. There is literally no way of stoping a country or a firm from pumping oil. It's only  an agreement based on faith with the Russians, Saudis, and desperate Texas oil rigs.

The Fed continues to maneuver to support the markets. The **VIX** continues to fall nearing 30 in a positive sign for the bulls.

Oil keeps moving up, also a good sign for the bulls.

Markets opened up yesterday and held the gains most of the day but slipped right near the close, you can pick a reason if you want but there was no major event driving the selling.

**Bitcoin** is holding above $9,000 this morning as Argentina is slipping into crisis. Still watching for a breakout above $10,500 before I buy again.

Futures are positive this morning, I'm still bullish. Always ready to have my mind changed.

**Watchlist:**

**LPTH** is a multi-day lowish float runner, resistance at $2.60

**TORC** is a lowish float, watching for a setup above $1.80

**NLS** is a lowish float in consolidation, watching for a breakout above $6.75ish

**PRTS** another lowish float, resistance is at $3.75

**CWBR** is moving on light volume with COVID-19 news, watching for a setup above $4

**VRML** on watch for a continuation

Not to mention new gaming console generations and explanation of VR/3D audio tech. Dolby Atmos is known as “4K” for audio, I see this tech only explaining into more homes as a premium home viewing experience becomes the norm. 
2. Maybe we end up in a situation where true cinemas become very specialized and offer exclusively IMAX level quality or above for a very premium experience. If Theaters  don’t die I see it as just a plus but I don’t feel Dolby is reliant on them in anyway. But if they stay around I believe they will need to keep upgrading there experience to our class what people have in their home. 

In there earnings call they spoke about haven’t a billion dollars of cash and no debt. Plus many growing sectors and a decent dividend.

Dow Jones futures edged higher late Tuesday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as **Walt Disney** ([**DIS**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Beyond Meat** ([**BYND**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) and **MercadoLibre** ([**MELI**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) were among the many earnings reports overnight after the coronavirus stock market rally continued to advance.

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Stock Market Today.

**Microsoft** ([**MSFT**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Shopify** ([**SHOP**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **PayPal** ([**PYPL**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **ServiceNow** ([**NOW**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Adobe** ([**ADBE**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Chegg** ([**CHGG**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) cleared buy points Tuesday, even as the Dow Jones and other major indexes slashed gains in the final hour.

MercadoLibre stock looks set to join them, blasting higher overnight. Beyond Meat stock rose but is well off highs. Disney stock woes continued overnight.

Adobe stock, ServiceNow stock, Chegg stock and Microsoft stock are all on **IBD Leaderboard**. All four boast perfect 99 **IBD Composite Ratings**. PayPal stock has a stellar 97 Composite Rating. Shopify stock has a 96 Composite Rating, while MercadoLibre stock has an OK 80 CR.

SHOP stock and PYPL stock broke out ahead of quarterly reports Wednesday, with Shopify earnings before the open. Microsoft stock had multiple entries, while Adobe stock moved back into a buy zone. ServiceNow stock cleared a buy point after surging last week on earnings. Chegg stock gapped higher on earnings.

Adobe and ServiceNow teamed up on customer service software, giving a lift to ADBE stock and NOW stock

MSFT stock is on **SwingTrader**. Adobe stock, ServiceNow stock and Chegg stock are on the **IBD 50 list**.

Microsoft stock, ServiceNow stock and Adobe stock are on **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list. PayPal stock is on the Long-Term Leaders watchlist.

## Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures were slightly above fair value, with Disney stock a modest drag. S&amp;P 500 futures edged higher. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.3%. No longer surging limit up or down, Dow Jones futures can still be volatile in overnight trading.

Remember that overnight action in **Dow futures**, MercadoLibre and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular **stock market** session.

Just three months ago, Disney was boasting about a record year for its movie studio and a strong start to the company’s dive into the streaming media wars. 

In late January, the coronavirus started battering businesses across Disney’s global portfolio when the company shuttered Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland.

By mid-March, all of the company’s theme parks were closed, movie theaters went dark, and television and film production was put on hold. Plus, Disney’s ESPN sports network was left with no major live sports to broadcast.

F**** 212 trading.
Was recommended by Friend to download this s**""*y app and he made out it was super easy to trade.

I watched a fair few videos online and have a bit of experience in trading.

I started off with + £50 and a fairly generous buy/sell gap.

After that I quickly went -300... A bit shocked I freaked out and withdrew all my money. I then thought it could have been just unlucky and withdrew 700 from my credit card. Big mistake....
I'm now £0 and have f-all left.

Whatever traded the trade went in the opposite direction, I'm absolutely certain trading 212 is fixed/dodgy. I rarely made any profit and every trade went negative almost instantly after trading.

I know this is completely my fault but idk what to do...

Many studios also chose to go the VOD route, particularly with those films that had already been in theaters for a few weeks before the pandemic lockdown kicked in, such as *Bloodshot, Emma,* and *The Way Back*. But other studios including **Disney** (NYSE:DIS) chose to hold back the release of some films until theaters are open again.

Of course, none of those sent to VOD had the remarkable success of Universal's *Trolls*, but it caused the studio to think it would be a good idea that even after the theaters open again, sending more movies directly to pay-per-view would be a good idea. AMC Entertainment had other ideas.

Adam Aron, the theater chain's CEO, told Universal chairman Donna Langley, ""AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theaters simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies."" AMC said it will never run another Universal movie in its theaters again.

The ace...

Studios can't make nearly as much money going the home route as they can going into theaters first and then hitting the rental market afterward. And if they anger theater owners by bypassing them, they could find themselves shut out and with much lower total receipts.

That's why AMC has the backing of Cineworld, which also said it ""will not be showing movies that fail to respect the windows"" of theatrical release before going to VOD.

**My thoughts**

This pandemic has changed how people are consuming media, given the time horizon before things go back to ""normal"" if ever, I can see some consumer habits/expectations shifting.  AMC and the other theatres should expect some changes on how (certain) movies are released. But I imagine they will come to some kind of agreement...or do you think the game's changed for good and AMC are F'd long term.

We're currently manufacturing 50,000 tests per day, plan to increase ID NOW manufacturing capacity to 2 million tests a month by June and are working to expand beyond that.”",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,403292,public,confidence,self,Abbott Labs Eclipses 1.4 Million Rapid Coronavirus Tests Shipped Across U.S.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gdzs3y/abbott_labs_eclipses_14_million_rapid_coronavirus/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'KImvKp3XMiRJamRDDA_xMu_HtvNVOH9Zi6-7kJl05lw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y65hq4Y0eAtixjBCXuc9lqcPCVHP81CRmRuHUHDSWQE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4ac26d2c739127742aa56a4301b38ddd76a7dd6', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y65hq4Y0eAtixjBCXuc9lqcPCVHP81CRmRuHUHDSWQE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61997c9ef832d4c11e44ec23f06ef5ed4421fc97', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y65hq4Y0eAtixjBCXuc9lqcPCVHP81CRmRuHUHDSWQE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf1cc5d4cfa63d08a3187bb41bfba64b352c5597', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y65hq4Y0eAtixjBCXuc9lqcPCVHP81CRmRuHUHDSWQE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddd2a0f456dbb75c7f863e25cabf3aff58b6c5e0', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y65hq4Y0eAtixjBCXuc9lqcPCVHP81CRmRuHUHDSWQE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa375834dc5e823f6174811923fbae10d77e9d47', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y65hq4Y0eAtixjBCXuc9lqcPCVHP81CRmRuHUHDSWQE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3da33b089ba0de44fc0a03427a4711a18794332', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 800, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y65hq4Y0eAtixjBCXuc9lqcPCVHP81CRmRuHUHDSWQE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5936bab3e8061cc4e241a43fa218eaba6ebfbc61', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,1588693814.0,,,,,,,

Buffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN. Berkshire *had* held sizeable positions (around 10%) in the major US airlines.

As well as this, Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3BN from $128BN at the end of 2019.

Clearly, as he is selling at a significant loss, Buffett believes that there is further pain ahead for the airlines. 

The GOAT is not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy...

Moreover, his cash position indicates that he doesn't believe that we have reached the stock market bottom yet, although he wouldn't give specifics.

Others however are more explicitly bearish.

The numbers are certainly [not looking good](https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/)...

**TRUTH 1/2:**

[1640 CEOs left their posts in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/2019-had-the-most-ceo-departures-on-record-with-more-than-1600.html), the highest year on record since tracking began in 2002.

For context, there were 1484 exits in *2008* when the country was embroiled in the financial crisis.

This trend has continued in 2020, [in January a record 219 CEOs left their posts](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/rapid-ceo-turnover-continues-with-a-record-number-of-top-executives-departing-in-january.html), the highest month on record.

The economy was going to crash anyway. It was inevitable.

However, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.

People will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.

To highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&amp;IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&amp;IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.

Last year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America ""exceptionally un-self-critical""

Warren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: ""Never bet against America""

In other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.

**TRUTH 2/2:**

As smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:

""Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.""

[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. 

On a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. 

A [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OT8xAOp_-y&amp;sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&amp;f=false) stated: 

""Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.""

According to a senior Salomon trader: ""Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.""

Yes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.

Overall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.

When everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. 

At the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...

Yesterday I was proven wrong as the bulls took over and pushed the entire market higher after starting off the day nearly 2% down.

The Fed announced it will crank up the money printer and start buying junk bonds to prop up the markets. Gold and Bitcoin are being sought as safe havens. The stock market is moving back up. Record highs are possible by the end of the month.

The bulls appear to be back in charge. I don't believe the trend is sustainable but I'll remain bullish until the charts change my mind.

**RVP** is a low float, I've seen a few articles pumping it, watching for a setup above $5

**AVEO** is a low float, watching for a setup above $8

**VERI** is a lowish float, watching for a setup above $6.50

i wonder this because lets say you have an etf which track small cap companies, if some of them in the top or the bottom are keep fluctuate between small-mid cap and small-micro cap respectively, what it will happen with the etf? 

till now my understanding goes with this, in a passive etf it will track an index (russell 2000 for example) and in an active eft some manager (or AI, I don't know) it will have to make the appropriate buys and sells to adjust the companies.

1. Fall-resistant Small Cap stocks are easier to identify than Large and Medium cap stocks
2. Fully equity funded (almost no debt) stocks performed distinguishably worse then those having debt to equity ratio &gt; 5%

I have 2k in TDA, but I’m not the biggest fan of their mobile platform. Webull is literally exactly what I feel I gravitate to in terms of UI, charts, etc. 

I’ve checked out Fidelity, Etrade, Interactive Brokers, Tasty, and Schwab. I’m not sure I want to keep TDA as my main account due to the Schwab buyout. I’m not looking to have changes to things right when I’m getting started. Whichever I choose, I’d like to get a Roth going with too. 

Any thoughts/suggestions? I’m mobile some for work so won’t have the ability to do a ton on my laptop, otherwise I would put an emphasis on web/desktop platforms. Should I just go all in with Webull? Stick with TDA? Try IBKR? I’m down to have several brokers with small sums of money, but just want a main one I leave long term investments in as well as focus most of my swings within.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,402507,public,confidence,self,Advice On Brokers,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gdkrcn/advice_on_brokers/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This will allow companies to rally like crazy. The big drop has been delayed I think till after the election with this move.

Demetri Kofinas speaks with Lowell Randel, Vice President of Government and Legal Affairs for the Global Cold Chain Alliance, which serves as the voice of the cold chain industry, representing 1,300 member companies in over 85 countries. The two discuss the impact that COVID-19 and the government shutdowns have had on food supply chains, processing facilities, and the industrial farm sector.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant shifts in consumer demand away from foodservice businesses like restaurants and towards foot retail outlets like supermarkets and groceries. Food industry players are in turn looking to adapt, redirecting products originally destined for the foodservice sector to retail instead. This has created challenges for farmers that have led, in some cases, to the euthanization of livestock and the wholesale destruction of crops ready for harvest.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,402383,public,confidence,self,'The Food Supply Chain is Breaking': Food Security &amp; The Global Pandemic.

I have made some dumb moves and learned from them (all on a small scale). I know there is a lot more risk in buying on margin so any advice or guidance would be appreciated.

Today is Star Wars Day, May the Fourth be with you!

There were 2 notable billionaires making news this weekend. On Friday Elon Musk in a crazy tweet storm said he thought that the share price for **TSLA** was too high, spurring a 10% selloff.

Over the weekend Warren Buffet, the legendary buy and hold forever investor announced that his company has dumped its entire holdings in the US Airlines industry. Previous they held about 10% in each of the following: **DAL**, **UAL**, **LUV**, **AAL**. Warren said, ""The world has changed.""

Futures are lower this morning after Friday's broad selloff. I expect the bears to own the day as the airlines drag down the overall markets.

This could drive more traders into the low floats I'm watching. Here is that list:

**Watchlist:**

**MIST** is a low float watching for a setup above $4.28

**MLND** is a low float watching for a setup above $1.90

**CJJD** is a low float with support at $2.40

**LIVX** has support at $3

**SLCA** watching for a setup above $2.50

When i realized I did this, I said “fuck it,” I wasn’t too confident in the next few months anyway and decided to sell off in order to put my money into a new brokerage to start fresh. At this point I was up ≈ $5k for the month and wanted to reevaluate my strategy for the long-term and wait for a good buying opportunity.

Now my question is, I don’t owe them that money, right? If I’m understanding this correctly it simply means I cannot buy stock until I have met the $25k minimum to day trade.

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

Just for the fun of it I have decided that I will run another community stock pick contest for this month.

You guys may recall [that I ran this back in February of 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ak3rdj/rstockmarket_febuary_2019_stock_picking_contest/).

It was fun for members of each community, but admittedly a bit time consuming to run.

Basically how this works is, instead of having all of you guys competing against each other on this subreddit, I thought we could change this up a bit and have you guys all go up against my other 2 stock communities that I also run.

Many of you may or may not know this, but I co-run the Stockaholics forum (link on the right sidebar here). I'm very active there, and put up a ton of content that you all see me putting up here on r/StockMarket. Additionally, I run our Discord live chat community (link also on the right sidebar here). So, basically this would be a 3 community stock picking challenge.

I think this could not only be a fun monthly competition going up against another group of members of an entirely different community...but, more importantly, I think this could be an opportunity to potentially introduce new people from our Stockaholics and Discord communities here into r/StockMarket and vice versa.

That all being said, unfortunately due to the limited number of participants on our Stockaholics community, I'm having to cap members at a minimum of 7 per community so that we have the same amount of participants for each community. So, basically I'm only allowing the first 7 members who submit their picks to participate on this month's community challenge. Sorry about that!

Anyway, this community picking contest will be following the same rules as our other regular monthly stock picking contests.

They are the following:

*****

&gt; - Use your Reddit username exactly as it is on r/StockMarket.
&gt; - Pick 2 stocks (only with a minimum price of $2) that trades on the NYSE.
&gt; - You cannot duplicate someone's exact pick!
&gt; - Choose Long or Short for both picks.
&gt; - 1 ETF allowed (no leveraged 2x, 3x ETFs/ETNs allowed!).
&gt; - No indexes or pinks/OTC or IPO's allowed.
&gt; - Give a rationale for both picks (OPTIONAL).
&gt; - You may edit your picks at any time, but all edits need to be done by 9:30AM eastern time on Monday morning.

&gt; **IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES YOU WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED INTO THIS COMPETITION!**

*****

I will be running a Google Form where you guys will be submitting your picks so I don't have to input them manually by hand.

# ([CLICK HERE TO SUBMIT YOU PICKS VIA THE GOOGLE FORM!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSercgCXMYVUuYBJ-0Uli0cvhlD4TquONq-PCKgRltX8PRfxfg/viewform?usp=pp_url))

Please follow the guidelines exactly as they are posted at the top of that Google Form!

If you guys find any bugs with this form please report them in here!

Using the Google Form requires you to be logged in with an account on Google. Simply create one (it's free). The reason I have everyone needing to have an account with Google to submit the form is so that we don't have duplicate entries in the spreadsheet. Only 1 entry per user is allowed!

Looking forward to seeing how this format goes in here for us this month. I think this will be a very fun experience for everyone participating.

Best of luck to all 3 of our communities in this second ever community monthly stock picking challenge! May the best community come out on top by month's end!

Oh, and almost forgot here is the spreadsheet link in here where all your responses from the Google Form will be going to.

# ([CLICK HERE FOR THE GOOGLE SHEET!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1upuMkww3R1yywgUTAMU8cN47DPYUHjUzLEyw3LrncFY/edit?usp=sharing))

Again, if you guys find any bugs or errors with any of these, please let me know pronto.

Most people actually start of trading penny stocks as opposed to what are known as *""blue chip stocks.""* Like anything else, there are pros and cons to each. I wanted to share this post to talk about some of the misconceptions of penny stocks, and explain why I personally focus on them with my own day trading.

First, **what even is a penny stock?** No... penny stocks are not just stocks worth a single penny and no they're not just stocks worth less than $1.00. By definition, any stock priced below $5.00 per share is considered a penny stock.

Penny stocks are priced low for a reason. They're *usually* the stock of a lesser-know company with not-so-reliable reputation to their shareholders. That's why they have such a bad reputation in general, and is why a lot of people think trading penny stocks is pure gambling. At the end of the day, penny stocks offer day traders a lot more than most blue chip stocks offer.

A **blue chip stock** is the stock of a huge company with a great reputation. These are stocks like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG), Facebook ($FB), etc... basically ""household name"" companies. Although these seem like the better investment options, they're not necessarily going to be the better option for an average trader.

**Penny Stock Pros:**

**Higher Volatility:** Penny stocks generally have much higher volatility than blue chip stocks, making them more high risk, high reward. A certain amount of volatility is needed for day trading! Without it there is not enough price movement to be able to get in and out of positions within the day like day traders do. The high volatility in the penny stock market is the reason traders are able to make 10%, 20%, even 50% or more in a single day... a *very* rare occurrence in the blue chip market.

**Less Money Needed:** With penny stocks you may be able to buy 1,000s of shares at a time with a small account when you'd only be able to buy a few shares of a blue chip stock. With that being said, penny stocks are usually looked at as the much better option for new traders with limited capital to start trading. In fact, that why most new traders do end up starting with penny stocks, which leads me to the third ""pro.""

**Less ""Competition"":** Your competition in the stock market is every single other buyer and seller. Everyone is competing against each other to get the best prices and to buy low and sell high for a profit. When one person loses money, another gains! *So..*. would you rather be competing against multi-billion dollar funds and investment firms in the blue chip market, or a herd on new traders with little-to-no experience in the penny stock market? Now that's not to say there aren't still investment firms and algorithmic trading taking place in the penny stock market, but it is less common than it is in the blue chip market.

**Penny Stock Cons:**

**Higher Volatility:** A double-edged sword. As I already mentioned above, the higher volatility of the penny stock market can definitely be a big benefit, but if you're not careful it can also cause larger losses than you would experience with less volatility. This is why risk management and proper position sizing is crucial, especially when trading stocks with high volatility.

**Less Volume:** This is one of the concerns that most traders bring up when they talk about why they don't trade penny stocks. In my opinion, this doesn't make much sense as a ""con"" just for penny stocks, because there are plenty blue chip stocks with low liquidity and volume as well. As day traders, we have to adapt to the market on a daily basis. This means finding the stocks making larger-than-average moves with high relative volume and, usually, news or a press release to go along. Volume is only an issue with day trading penny stocks if you're choosing the wrong penny stocks to day trade.

**Low-Quality Companies:** Again, penny stocks are priced low for a reason. If they were multi-billion dollar companies with years of growing profitability, their stock price would reflect that. It's important to trade the stock, don't fall in love with it! You don't want to invest in a penny stock long-term, because the odds of you picking the next Amazon of Apple are slim to none. Instead, take advantage of the increase volatility brought by the penny stock market for day trading and look to the more reliable blue chip market for your swing trades longer-term investments.

As you can see, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider before diving into the penny stock market to start day trading. If you have the discipline to manage risk properly then they can be a great option to grow a small trading account in a short period of time. *Otherwise,* you may want to take things a bit more slowly by focussing your trading on less volatile, more stable blue chip stocks.",False,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,400271,public,confidence,self,Trading Penny Stocks vs. Blue Chip Stocks,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gc85t0/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# **April’s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday’s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.
*****
&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.
*****
&gt; “I think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. “I think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.”
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
*****
&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. “If they go well that’s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that’ll be a blow to confidence,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; # Best April in years
Stocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. “Now there’s not that much to look forward to,” he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.
*****
&gt; “We had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,” said Stovall. “It’s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. … Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April’s gains.” The S&amp;P 500′s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.
*****
&gt; # Virus economy
Economists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. “This is all a stab in the dark,” he said.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,” said Stanley. “But I do think you’re going to see steady improvement. I think you’re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.”
*****
&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.
*****
&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.
*****
&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.
*****
&gt; “I think it could spook people,” said Schumacher. “In the markets, we’ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.”
*****
&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday’s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it’s unclear how quickly it can recover.
*****
&gt; “There are people who will go and do things as soon as they’re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,” he said. “I do think expecting we’re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.”
*****
&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.
*****
&gt; # A new 20-year bond
The Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.
*****
&gt; “The supply announcement we think is significant because you’re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,” said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.

# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession

&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren’t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.

&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit’s preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.

&gt; Today’s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing—the so-called official PMI—provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg’s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; But that’s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.

&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.

&gt; “The more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “Given the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we’ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.”

&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter—potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).

&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.

# Global Central Banks All In

&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.

&gt; “The central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And the market is seeing it. It’s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.”

&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity

&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 – 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.

&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.

&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.

&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim “Don’t fight the Fed” alive even in an age of zero rates.

# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition

&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# This is Still an Election Year

&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.

&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**

&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.

&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman’s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.

# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot

&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two—Utilities and Financials—above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.

&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.

&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.

Additionally, the ability to refuel and the potential for near-earth-orbit economy might also enable or create more demand for Starship launches.\n\nOverall, it seems to me that it might be worth it to SpaceX to offer fuel for sale in orbit.

I'll start with the tankers. (Let me note that I do not expect the general market trend to be positive for the next few weeks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPreface: Positive Virus news is generally bad for Tanker company share prices.\n\n**NAT**\n\nCurrent share price: $6.12\n\nEPS Q1 2019: $0.04\n\nEPS Q1 2020 Estimate: $0.26\n\nEarnings: 5/12\n\nNAT operates exclusively VLCC tankers, of which the majority are on spot price rental. Current spot price for VLCC tankers up to 180k/day, up from an average of 19k/day this time last year. This is an over 9x increase. NAT is also currently operating more tankers on spot price rental, increasing volume under spot price contract over last year.\n\nRevenues at current prices indicate an earnings estimate closer to $0.36. This is the high end of earnings estimates. Additionally, demand for oil consumption is not likely to improve soon. If anything, a slow reopening of states without ports will not affect tanker company bottom lines and will extend the operating duration of oil producers in the permian. Keep in mind, if oil consumption does not increase, wells will either shut down, or more likely, prices will go negative again. This may have some effect on spot price for tanker transports. That said, spot prices are not likely to diminish significantly in the near future.\n\nAs a bonus, NAT recently (like yesterdayish) approved a buyback program to take advantage of increased revenues. This is the best news for NAT holders at this time. Their true intentions will be reflected in the earnings call.\n\nPrice Target: $8 in the short term. If quarantine continues through June with no oil production cuts, I would expect at $10+ is possible, but unlikely.\n\nHistorical action levels: [https://imgur.com/a/dzsAZop](https://imgur.com/a/dzsAZop)\n\nOne week chart showing some consolidation for a potential breakout: [https://imgur.com/a/10DZWE7](https://imgur.com/a/10DZWE7)\n\n**Note - I suggested this as a bullish play last weekend, and as such my $8 price target was hit on Tuesday. This ship may have already sailed. Pun intended. I would find another trade.**\n\nRecommendation: If you are dead set on an NAT play, shares at a reduced price through earnings, or options with expiry longer than 45 days out purchased next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DHT Holdings**\n\nCurrent share price: 7.10\n\nEPS Q1 2019: $0.13\n\nEPS Q1 2020 Estimate: $0.57\n\nEarnings: 5/5\n\nDHT operates Suezmax size tankers, the next step down from VLCC. They currently have 23 of 27 operating on spot pricing. Current spot price is up 141% at $3.92 bpd from March of 2019 to March of 2020. I think that this earnings estimate is roughly accurate, but suezmax vessels have more room for positive price movement as more and more storage is filled to capacity. Suezmax ships allow producers more maneuverability and fluidity to store their oil, as such, turnover rates are higher than VLCC vessels.\n\nHistorical action levels: [https://imgur.com/a/X3W3kD4](https://imgur.com/a/X3W3kD4)\n\nOne week chart showing downward channel (Im not sure this trend is completed yet) before potential breakout: [https://imgur.com/a/CYCaYcv](https://imgur.com/a/CYCaYcv)\n\nRecommendation: I think the resistance levels for DHT are more relevant than those of NAT, and are also more realistic to be beaten. Calls mid week for EOW earnings at least 2 weeks out. General market sentiment is important for this trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MGM**\n\nCurrent share price: 15.01\n\nSummary of MGM's plans to reopen casinos: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/04/30/mgm-plans-reopen-las-vegas-bellagio-new-york-new-york/3061417001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/04/30/mgm-plans-reopen-las-vegas-bellagio-new-york-new-york/3061417001/)\n\nI would expect the mayor of Las Vegas to attempt to reopen the tourism to the city along with President Trump's guidance. If they are able, they will reopen soon. They likely will not have large scale shows or concert events to draw in customers, but gambling will be open to some extent. I do not expect casinos to see a large influx of patrons, and this will end up being a net negative for them in the coming months as their expenses will increase more than revenues. They may even potentially have to re-close if Covid testing reveals an uptick in cases in the Las Vegas area. That said, their saving grace is Macau, where a significantly large portion of their income is generated. China expects tourism to Macau to increase, but I would take that with a grain of salt.\n\nGiven MGM's recent meteoric rise to nearly $18 per share, I think they fall into the sentiment of the rest of the market and will suffer in the coming month. I expect the share price will visit mid-april prices of $13, or potentially lower following a general trend with SPY. Luckily, If you see these prices, I consider MGM a very long term and stable play. They have enough cash on hand to last an entire year with no revenue; a situation that is uncommon at this time. In general, event or discretionary based spending, hospitality and travel will be the last to recover, but this is a commonly assessed sentiment.\n\nHistorical action levels: MGM was not surprisingly rejected by the historical support level of $17.50 this week [https://imgur.com/a/aoRNvk8](https://imgur.com/a/aoRNvk8)\n\n5 day chart does not provide any major price movement indication.\n\nRecommendation: Sell shares, do nothing until share prices revisit mid-April levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always, feel free to comment and tell me why I'm wrong."", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As requested, I will provide DD for NAT, DHT Holdings and MGM based on votes from my previous thread. I&amp;#39;ll start with the tankers. (Let me note that I do not expect the general market trend to be positive for the next few weeks)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preface: Positive Virus news is generally bad for Tanker company share prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current share price: $6.12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EPS Q1 2019: $0.04&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EPS Q1 2020 Estimate: $0.26&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earnings: 5/12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NAT operates exclusively VLCC tankers, of which the majority are on spot price rental. Current spot price for VLCC tankers up to 180k/day, up from an average of 19k/day this time last year. This is an over 9x increase. NAT is also currently operating more tankers on spot price rental, increasing volume under spot price contract over last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenues at current prices indicate an earnings estimate closer to $0.36. This is the high end of earnings estimates. Additionally, demand for oil consumption is not likely to improve soon. If anything, a slow reopening of states without ports will not affect tanker company bottom lines and will extend the operating duration of oil producers in the permian. Keep in mind, if oil consumption does not increase, wells will either shut down, or more likely, prices will go negative again. This may have some effect on spot price for tanker transports. That said, spot prices are not likely to diminish significantly in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, NAT recently (like yesterdayish) approved a buyback program to take advantage of increased revenues. This is the best news for NAT holders at this time. Their true intentions will be reflected in the earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Price Target: $8 in the short term. If quarantine continues through June with no oil production cuts, I would expect at $10+ is possible, but unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Historical action levels: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/dzsAZop""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/dzsAZop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One week chart showing some consolidation for a potential breakout: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/10DZWE7""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/10DZWE7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note - I suggested this as a bullish play last weekend, and as such my $8 price target was hit on Tuesday. This ship may have already sailed. Pun intended. I would find another trade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recommendation: If you are dead set on an NAT play, shares at a reduced price through earnings, or options with expiry longer than 45 days out purchased next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DHT Holdings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current share price: 7.10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EPS Q1 2019: $0.13&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EPS Q1 2020 Estimate: $0.57&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earnings: 5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DHT operates Suezmax size tankers, the next step down from VLCC. They currently have 23 of 27 operating on spot pricing. Current spot price is up 141% at $3.92 bpd from March of 2019 to March of 2020. I think that this earnings estimate is roughly accurate, but suezmax vessels have more room for positive price movement as more and more storage is filled to capacity. Suezmax ships allow producers more maneuverability and fluidity to store their oil, as such, turnover rates are higher than VLCC vessels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Historical action levels: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/X3W3kD4""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/X3W3kD4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One week chart showing downward channel (Im not sure this trend is completed yet) before potential breakout: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/CYCaYcv""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/CYCaYcv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recommendation: I think the resistance levels for DHT are more relevant than those of NAT, and are also more realistic to be beaten. Calls mid week for EOW earnings at least 2 weeks out. General market sentiment is important for this trade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MGM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current share price: 15.01&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary of MGM&amp;#39;s plans to reopen casinos: &lt;a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/04/30/mgm-plans-reopen-las-vegas-bellagio-new-york-new-york/3061417001/""&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/04/30/mgm-plans-reopen-las-vegas-bellagio-new-york-new-york/3061417001/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would expect the mayor of Las Vegas to attempt to reopen the tourism to the city along with President Trump&amp;#39;s guidance. If they are able, they will reopen soon. They likely will not have large scale shows or concert events to draw in customers, but gambling will be open to some extent. I do not expect casinos to see a large influx of patrons, and this will end up being a net negative for them in the coming months as their expenses will increase more than revenues. They may even potentially have to re-close if Covid testing reveals an uptick in cases in the Las Vegas area. That said, their saving grace is Macau, where a significantly large portion of their income is generated.

I did state a bear market would be happening before but I predicted it too soon. It was largely because I did not do enough research before on economics and behaviours. 

The overall outlook looks like it is downward for the month but how soon that comes is anyones guess. However, this month we will likely see a bear market with testing the bottom at end of the month, 

Indicators are:

* Warren Buffet indicator states that the stock market is far too overvalued without a correction recently - means we are due one 
* Elon Musk has today sold all hes Tesla shares. I think he is going all cash because he knows Tesla has reached its peak and will never hit that high for year so he is playing the smart move and turning it all into cash. Sign of bad things to come. Rich people turning into cash is a bad sign
* Oil companies are struggling with prices still not recovered wiping off billions in profits
* Some oil companies will go bust in the next 2-3 weeks
* Personal bankruptcies are around the corner along with many businesses
* The TED rate is above 1 and that is never a good sign. When the TED rate spikes up too quickly we have a crash. 100% of the time. It is not spiking right now but it is stabilising far far higher than what it was before the crash in march, which is stating a very very very high risk of defaults, and that a crash will happen. This is the biggest one.
* Trump China relations have worsened
* Trump Trusted China, in that he would close the country for 2 months and open it back up to normal like China did and all will be great. All he had to do was prop up the market through the fed and that would keep the markets up for 2 months, and when the economy opened it will soar, helping hes election. Obviously he knows this is about to backfire so he is very angry and ready to impose sanctions. Clear sign
* Germany and Texas opened up, the daily new cases has risen. With Texas at a massive spike and the country only eased a bit. This increased the R value meaning lifting restrictions too quickly will cause a massive health issue.
* This health issue is a big problem in america as people dont have insurance. This will cause many deaths and or bankruptices. Probably both.
* Goldman Sachs has stated more people has turned cash this week meaning people are waiting for something really bad to happen. 
* The Dow jones has always shown signs of bearish behaviour before Nasdaq has come to the rescue with amazing gains. Now that Nasdaq has run out of steam, we wont see it come to the rescue
* The dollar is increasing very very quickly in value over other currencies
* The market has too much positive news priced in. It assumes the country will just open up all of a sudden. It likely will not if cases spike quickly.
* We just passed the first quarter and we were only in lockdown for 2-3 weeks. Results were not going to be too bad. In Q2 we are in lockdown for 5 weeks and counting for most economies and states. Even with social distancing economy wont be at full speed. We are expecting over 40% contraction 

Signs a crash wont happen

* Tech companies are doing great
* Republicans are insisting on opening the country, a fast opening of the country will see a lot of deaths but will see america develop herd immunity faster. Meaning the economy rebounds faster rather than following an L shape.
* FED is doing everything it can. 
* Interest rates are at 0
* Summer is coming up
* Testing is increasded very very quickly and somehow contact tracing wont happen
* China hasnt closed down (I think they are just underreporting cases to not close down again)
* The stock market is disconnected from economics
* First quarter was not as bad as people thought
* Not all economies are doing badly around the world
* Coronavirus cases are more than estimated. It is likely to be 4-5x the amount reported officially

(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is in talks to buy Softomotive Ltd., a U.K.-based startup that makes software robots to automate tasks, according to people familiar with the matter.

If talks are successful, a deal could be announced as soon as the coming weeks, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. No final decision has been made and talks could still fall apart, they said.

The terms of the deal being discussed couldn’t immediately be learned. Softomotive raised $25 million in 2018 from London-based investment firm Grafton Capital.

Representatives for Microsoft and Softomotive declined to comment.

Softomotive specializes in robot process automation technology, or software that helps companies save time and money by automating repetitive, manual tasks such as entering data into spreadsheets. The company’s products are used in the health-care, banking, insurance and telecommunications industries, according to its website.

There are about 1.5M buyers and engineers from every big name company using the platform every month to find new suppliers to buy from or add to their supply chain. So it is a really interesting view into activity and corresponding interest from 70K different categories of products and services. The early returns have been interesting. It seems to be correlating with the S&amp;P 500 closely as a leading indicator. The data science team let me know they had been tracking a predicted drop which it now looks like we are starting to experience.

He has invested in the stock market for the last 30 years. He managed $10+ BILLION dollars of other people’s money when he worked for a firm in Philadelphia. At age 36, he decided to stop working professionally and simply invest his own money so that he could invest from home and spend more time with his family. For the past 18 years, that is what he has done. 

Through the ups and downs of the market the last 18 years, we have trusted that the Lord will always provide, and He has! We have been blessed financially. Others, through the years, have come to my dad and asked him if he could invest their money, too. But, unfortunately he can’t unless he has a business. We looked into that a few times over the years, but the time and financial cost of starting the business, such as a mutual fund, seemed too daunting. Finally, the desire to help others became too great for him to ignore. 😀

One Rock Fund, his new mutual fund, has been up and running now since March 6th. He continues to invest in the stock market, just as he did for us all those 18 years, but now other people can add their money to the fund, as well. 

You can invest as little as $2,000. Other investors have hundreds of thousands of dollars in the fund. And you can even take things that are already in existence, like an IRA that you have, and transfer all or some of those monies into the fund. 

I have seen a couple editorials mentioning that this is definitely not a time to put money in the market. We disagree. You’ve heard the term… Buy low, sell high. During this virus, the market has gone pretty low. That’s the time you want to put money in. Do you think that a year from now the market will be better than where it is now? We do. 

Since the fund launched on March 6th, the portfolio is up 22.55%.

Currently looking at some charts for ticker LB and trying to identify a potential for end of this week / start of next week.

Looking at a 2 hour and 4 hour timeframes:

\- Short term MA has crossed over (below) longer term MA on the 2 hr chart. Is looking like it will cross on the 4 hour chart.

\- Williams AD, stochastic momentum and KST are all showing a down trend under their respective averages on the 2 hour and 4 hour timeframe.

[https://imgur.com/a/9djBdOm](https://imgur.com/a/9djBdOm) 

To me this appears that a bearish short term trend is developing / has developed.

However looking at slightly longer term support and resistance, it's difficult to picture where the price may move. 

[https://imgur.com/a/XKWdWy2](https://imgur.com/a/XKWdWy2) 

Ordinarily if the longer term trend was clearer (e.g. a downward channel with lower highs and lower lows) I would make a move to capitalise on the downside such as shorting the stock or selling a bear credit spread.

Any thoughts regarding how to further read this scenario and what may be a suitable play?

Gap Ups: BA, CLX, MDGS, MRNA, TVIX/UVXY, 

Gap Downs: JNUG/NUGT, NVDA, TQQQ, WDC

Markets gapping down again. As I have stated previously, trading large gap days are some of the most difficult to trade. Hundreds of stocks are reporting earnings, yet almost none are reacting pre market which is concerning. There is a good chance I will sit today out as most gap downs are gapping into moving averages and I don't see many stocks with good opportunities. If I decide to trade today, I will be patient off of the immediate open and concentrate on key levels of support or resistance for entries. Due to most stocks gaping into support, the list today will be short and I will be running scans intraday to look for better opportunities on earnings plays if any decide to trigger. Before entering into any positions, have a defined risk to reward with stops and targets calculated before entering trades.

The old adage ""sell and may and go away"" refers to the lack of volume and volatility that typically accompanies summer months. I don't think that will be the case this year. Considering that the pandemic is far from over and the **VIX** is inching back towards 40. Plus no one is going on vacation right now.

Yesterday saw a dip in the overall markets, bulls put up a fight but couldn't make any gains. This morning the bulls seem to be absent as futures are drifting lower and the **VIX** is climbing up.

Lots of lower float stocks on my list today. When the markets dips low floats have the best chance to move up

**Watchlist:**

**TRIB** is a low float, resistance at $2

**IFRX** is a low float, support at $7

**LPTH** is a lowish float, watching for a setup above $2.60

**NH** is a lowish float, support at $2.75

**AKTS** is a highly shorted lowish float, watching for a setup above $9.31

**LIVX** resistance at $2.80

**OCX** has resistance at $3

**AR** has resistance at $3

**KOS** watching for a setup above $1.74

Im a real estate investor, and ive been thinking about stocks amid this covid crisis. I still havent pulled the trigger although i am invested in index funds. Im not knocking on stocks, Im very much open to it, but ive been wondering how can stocks beat the returns im getting in my rental properties. Specifically single family homes. 

For instance around my market the average home is $300k. I usually buy my properties in C class neighborhoods for $100k with a 25% down payment. Renovations average 25k. So im 50k all in. Once i refinance im able to pull all of my 50k out. Have 40 - 50k in equity in each property while receiving monthly cash flow. 

After 5 properties, thats $250,00 equity, plus my orginal $50,000 and my anuall cashflow of $24,000 all within two years. Essentially my portfolio is an infinite return portfolio. How would i be able to earn these returns in the stock market within two years? With a 50k orginal investment? Like i said im open to stocks, is there a way to leverage with a specific strategy like how i specialize in real estate? Im genuinely curious.

I’m kicking myself for selling my shares of CCL and MGM that I had a couple weeks ago because of a few red days. Still made a profit but my average for CCL then was close to $8! 

ERI up 18% average cost $18.17
MGM up 35% average cost $12.48
CCL up 25% average cost $12.72

What is the best course of action here. My initial thoughts are keep what I have even if the prices drop and keep buying in to drop my average cost. On the other hand part of me is telling myself sell the percentage I need to to break even on my initial investment and ride on just my profits and then buy back during any dips. The problem being you can’t time the market and who knows if there would be dips enough to come back in lower than my current averages. 

I’ve learned a few lessons so far for only being in this game a few weeks. I think the biggest two were using limits when placing orders after hours so I don’t end up spending more than intended at opening and the second being to stick to the stocks I’ve been focusing on and not letting hype trains veer me towards other stocks I don’t even know what they are... my 100 shares of UAVS falls into both those lessons. I knew what the company was just not the background story of what looks to be a pump and dump something I also just learned about haha!

All in all my entire portfolio is risk reward based. I haven’t gotten crazy and only started with a bank roll of $7,400. I currently have about $750 left I’m looking to pop into something. 

Other stocks I was eyeing include ERIC, SIX, FUN, DAL, QCOM, SWKS, DKNG, RTX, SYF.

Sell both put and call options around the current price. 

Set stop orders up around both. If the stock goes up or down close enough where the option would get exercised, I’d have a purchase order (for the call) or a sell (for the put) set up so that I don’t lose anything from the actual movement of the underlying regardless of direction but can keep the premiums. 

I’d do this weekly. I’d start tomorrow, probably not get more than $10-15 as I’m sure theta would have made the premiums pretty negligible. 

Ex: bought share for 55. Share is now worth 50. 

Sell 5/1 48p, set stop limit sell order for the underlying I already own at $48 so if it does go down to say $47, when the option expires And is exercised I’d have to purchase the shares back at $48 so that transaction is negated. 

Sell 5/1 52c, set stop limit to purchase the stock at $52. That way, if the underlying goes to $53, I’d have already purchased another 100 shares of the underlying for $52 bc of my order so when the option is exercised, the buy/sell for $52 can be negated. 

Any thoughts on this strategy? Doing it weekly might be tougher bc of the risk of overnight gapping up or down that I couldn’t control.

I’m thinking this is sort for a spin on the wheel strategy, doing both the cash covered puts and covered calls part at the same time.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,398852,public,confidence,self,"Down on some stocks,is this a decent options strategy?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gb78s5/down_on_some_stocksis_this_a_decent_options/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* technology changes happen fast!
* **edge computing** will replace most cloud computing.
* we'll still use the cloud, but a lot of load will be taken off the cloud, this also means the amount of data being sent to the cloud will be trimmed. the fat will be cut off before transport

Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

It's a kind of fantasy sports alternative with the stock market used as a substitute for DFS.

Please tear our ideas apart in the comments (or maybe give us a suggestion).

TL;DR: stocks as players, daily games, coins for good performance, coins can be redeemed for prizes. Money prizes, big contests, and private rooms in development.

# Stocks as players

When we first had the idea to mix fantasy sports with the stock market, we wanted to keep things simple. So we ignored your typical stock market simulator with candlestick charts, bloated dashboards, and simulated money.

Why can't we replace fantasy teams with fantasy portfolios and draft popular stocks instead of star players?

We feed near real-time NASDAQ info in the game. Now you can pick real stocks with real performance data for your team/portfolio.

# Daily Games &amp; Gameplay

The problem with real-world stock picking is you need to wait for the results for months or even years. This is \~similar to the early days of fantasy sports, where we had to wait for the end of the season to claim winnings.

DraftKings and other daily fantasy platforms solved this setback with daily fantasy games. So we decided to bring DFS to the stock-picking world.

1. You just need to pick five popular stocks for your fantasy portfolio.
2. Wait for the stock market to open
3. Watch your portfolio go up and down during the session.
4. At the end of the day, you can get your results. Not long enough to make you old.

# Coins &amp; prizes

Money prizes and paid tournaments are pretty complicated legally. As we wanted to ship our game fast, we decided to stick to the free-to-play model. You do not need to pay to enter. Instead, you just play and earn or lose internal coins. Coins can be redeemed for prizes.

If you’ve lost, you can watch an ad to reset the balance.

# Money prizes &amp; contests

To make the game into a real fantasy sports alternative, we want to add money prizes in the future. We plan to add mass contests with prize pools and private competitions.

You can try the [playable prototype](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantasy-invest/id1479666326) with coins/prizes on the App Store if you’re interested.

And it does it well as in it provides me with what I want. 

Does it do it conveniently though? Absolutely not, I have to go through 2 factor authentication and many other hassles just to check a number. Day after day, I realized why isn't there an app that just alerts me when a significant change in price happens so I don't have to log in every day and manually check. 

So, I searched the app store for an app that just lets me know when a certain stock changes by a certain percent. That's all I wanted, I didn't want to pay, I certainly did not want to sign up and I didn't want any complicated features or annoying ads. I unfortunately couldn't find anything like that on the app store so I searched reddit, and got here. There are many other posts on this subreddit requesting what I want, and unfortunately there just isn't a simple stock alerter that is free and with no sign up. So, I made one.

It's still in its early stages but it does the essentials. As in, it alerts you through chrome notifications when your stock changes by a percentage you specify, in real-time. 

It would be amazing if you guys can try it out and tell me what you think.

Hi everyone!

I just posted another episode in my python for finance Youtube series. This series walks you through step by step many relevant python programs and is perfect for beginners as I start right from downloading python.

**Episode 6: Calculate Pivot Points and Resistance**

The new episode shows you how to automatically calculate key pivot points and resistance in a stocks price action. . Here is an example of what it looks like for Tesla: [https://imgur.com/ElCqTy5](https://imgur.com/ElCqTy5)

This program can be easily linked with a python email alert system to notify you when a stock breaks through resistance.

If you are interested here is the link to the newest episode:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdpaita5GcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdpaita5GcE)

I have also linked below the other episodes.

**Episode 1: Intro to Python for Finance**

This should be the first one you watch if you are new to python. I go through everything from downloading the language to accessing and manipulating stock data

[https://youtu.be/myFD0np9eys](https://youtu.be/myFD0np9eys)

**Episode 2: How to Back-test Strategies (Moving averages+ more)**

I show how to set up a program that can test any strategy where you can codify entry and exit signals. It can test performance going back decades and outputs Batting average, Average Gain, Average Loss, Max Gain, Max Loss, Average days held for Gains, Average days held for losses and Total Return.

[https://youtu.be/eYK2SNygAog](https://youtu.be/eYK2SNygAog)

**Episode 3: How to make a Stock Screener (Mark Minervini Criteria)**

This episode covers how to set up a program that can screen for any technical criteria. I use Mark Minervini's trading template as an example. It's very easy to modify.

[https://youtu.be/hngHA9Jjbjc](https://youtu.be/hngHA9Jjbjc)

**Episode 4: Green Line Calculator**

This episode shows how to calculate Green Line Values and write them to excel. Green line values are prior ATHs that are significant resistance.

[https://youtu.be/m90HHpbHzlw](https://youtu.be/m90HHpbHzlw)

**Episode 5: Email Alerts**

This episode shows you how to set up email alerts that you can use to alert yourself of any technical criteria. It is easy to modify and use with any strategy

[https://youtu.be/Ut\_CpsF4qcs](https://youtu.be/Ut_CpsF4qcs)

I hope you guys find these tutorials helpful. I've found that coding helps strengthen discipline and remove emotion from your trading. These tools have helped me improve my process.

Not everyone is going to trade the same. If we did we would all be rich or broke, no in-between 😅 remember that there’s isn’t a one true rule to trading the markets. If you ask one trader how to do it and ask another, you will get completely different answers. Don’t expect to ever ask that one question that is suddenly going to turn you into a profitable trade.
The best thing you can do is gather all of the information you can find, process it and try and implement that into trading in a way that is helpful to you. Practice, practice practice practice. You will likely lose money. But if you make sure that you use small amounts that are relevant to your experience and you keep practicing and learning from mistake then you will get there.

There are things like indicators and oscillators and trends that can help you make a decision that a lot of people use. There are new apps and articles that people use. These are things that can be used in the exact same way as another trader uses them. But when and where they use them is an entirely different story.

One traders frame of mind may be completely different to another. One trader can set their TP just one pip above another traders TP and that can mean the difference between making money and losing money. No single trade will be the same as another (unless your copy trading). 

You must remember to ignore all of the noise and process the information for yourself. That’s the only way you will know whether something will work for you or not.

Saying that, its good to hear OPINIONS on how to do things and have good discussions about the topic in hand. It can be very productive in fact. Any question is a good question if it means that you yourself are going to learn something from the answer. There is so much solid information and educational to be taught and learned. BUT they are all just pieces to your own puzzle that you must figure out.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,397580,public,confidence,self,What works for some...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gaj4tn/what_works_for_some/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But anyways I would appreciate if anyone here can point me to a YouTube video or an article on what would be the best way to analyze DIVIDEND stocks so that I can learn to pick stable individual stocks instead of risky ones. As right now I’m investing in ETF’s but I want to grow my horizons and start picking individual stocks.
