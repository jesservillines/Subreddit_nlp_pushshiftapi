Paradigm (ASX:PAR) is an Australian biotechnology company who's main focus is repurposing Pentosan Polysulfate Sodium (PPS) to treat Osteoarthritis. PPS is already an FDA approved drug with a long track record of safely treating inflammation. Paradigm is doing clinical studies to use PPS to treat Osteoarthritis and they've already had promising results in the first human trials.

This would be my first major investment in a company, and I'm feeling relatively confident I've picked a good one, my reasons being:

Repurposing an old drug means they don't have do to a lot of safety studies because they already exist

Osteoarthritis is a HUGE market, with 31 million sufferers in the USA alone

The board members appear to be experienced in both biopharma, the drug PPS, anti-inflammatory medications, clinical operations etc

&amp;#x200B;

Lets assume you started your investment journey on January 1st, 2000, and made a lump sum of 12,0000 into the s&amp;p500 for the year. 

That 12,000 lump-sum from January 1st, 2000, to December 31st, 2018 would have went on to average a CAGR of 4.83%, and would be worth ($29,404).

On January 1st, 2001 you make another 12,000 lump-sum. That amount would have went on to average a CAGR of 5.66% by December 31st, 2018, and would be worth ($32,327).

On January 1st, 2002 you make another 12,000 lump-sum. That amount would have went on to average a CAGR of 6.81% by December 31st, 2018, and would be worth ($36,777).

On January 1st, 2003 you make another 12,000 lump-sum. That amount would have went on to average a CAGR of 8.95% by December 31st, 2018, and would be worth ($47,295).

On January 1st, 2004 you make another 12,000 lump-sum. That amount would have went on to average a CAGR of 7.74% by December 31st, 2018, and would be worth ($36,714).

And so on and so on..

On January 1st, 2018 you make another 12,000 lump-sum. That amount would have went on to average a CAGR of -4.42% by December 31st, 2018, and would be worth ($11,496).

&amp;#x200B;

In the 19 year span between January 1st 2000 and December 21st, 2019, you would have achieved a total CAGR of 153.17. Divide that by the number of years (19) and you get 8.06%. Your total investment at the start of 2019 would be worth over $500,000 ($228,000 being the money you invested).

Whenever i look at stock prices through the years by looking at the maximum range they've often been growing steadily until around 2014 when they pretty much all suddenly shoot up at a rate much much faster than they ever have before to the point where at the maximum range they appear to have an almost vertical line at today's point in time. Why is this? what causes the stocks to be worth so much more now and to be increasing at such a rapid rate now when compared to 15 years ago.

But now I'm in a job where, if I contribute 3% of my salary to a TDA, the employer will contribute 3% as well. I have a few questions:

1. The employer will always contribute pre-tax, but I have a choice between pre-tax and post-tax contributions. Which should I choose, if my eventual plan is to roll it over to a backdoor Roth IRA? If I go post-tax, the TDA account will have two source buckets, and I will have to pay tax on the employer contribution at the time of conversion. 
2. The TDA account is set up with Fidelity, and it requires me to choose one of their funds for the first 2% of the contribution, and have the remaining 98% shunted to a quasi-brokerage account that they call BrokerageLink, that will allow me to buy more mutual funds. If I decide to roll the money over to a Roth IRA every year, would I be better off just putting all 100% of my money in VANGUARD INST INDEX rather than mess with the BrokerageLink?
3. If I go with the last option, since it does not look like I can just keep the funds as cash until the rollover, what happens to capital gains on the VANGUARD INST INDEX when I roll it over? Do I pay tax on that?

First and foremost, my title has made me “gun shy,” to play the market. However, after continuing to work I’ve recovered my losses, and I’ve amassed about $60,000USD currently sitting in an Ally savings account, that I’m willing to invest. This would still leave me a nest egg in case of emergencies.

My interest to play the market has been spurred by the fact that many of the stocks that I was trading two years have nearly doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled. One example, Shopify, I traded it at $90, and it’s well over $300 now! It makes me sick to my stomach to look at this, however, it has made me realize that stocks is not a game of emotion nor gains overnight. I was trying to get rich quick like a friend of mine who made over half million in options in 6 months (he ended up losing it all, lol). It has made me realize that if I had just put the $30,000 I had started with into a long term portfolio I would have been much more well off now, than I had been playing options. 

My question to you Reddit users is, where should I start! If you had to spread out 50k-80k (maximum willing to invest), at this time with the market so high where would you put your money? Would you wait for a decline in the market? The idea is that I’m looking to put my money into these stocks and let it ride for a while, obviously making some plays here and there as I watch the market almost every day. 

Stocks that I’m looking to spread my money over are Shopify, Apple, Googl, Visa, Costco, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Starbucks, and Facebook. 

Considering a semi conductor like MU or AMAT as well. I know my portfolio seems Tech heavy, but it seems to be what’s been moving for a couple years. 

I’d appreciate any educated input, as it would be extremely helpful to allowing me to make a more sound decision.

But perhaps we can chime in with the fees for whatever broker we use. I'll get us started with the fees or restrictions for several brokers. These stocks are five letters and end in ""Y"" or ""F"" and the F's are the hardest to trade, which can be frustrating because some extremely good niches, international diversification and up-and-coming resource companies can be found there.

Interactive Brokers: Around $1 or so per trade (for light volume) and NO fees for either as far as I can tell. I've placed several trades but still looking into this, I fear they could be a bit hidden.

TD Ameritrade: Regular trading fees ($6.95) for Y's, plus $15 per ""F"" - I found these fees maddening, but at least the option's there. Also be careful not to sell ANY of your shares of a Commission-Free ETF within 30 days of buying, this is a Last-In-First-Out situation and will always incur a fee. Ran into this when I had 20 of something, bought 5 more and then sold 3 -- BOOM! Big fee.

Firstrade: As far as I know you can only trade Y's, but with zero commission!

R\*binh\*\*d: No F's, but now offering a limited selection of Y's (mostly large cap foreign companies and a few miners), zero commission.

Just2Trade/WhoTrades: Used to offer this, no longer does!

M1 Finance and Stash do not offer either as far as I can tell.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

After doing more research on Dalio's latest thoughts about paradigm shifts, I wanted to start digging into gold mining companies. This is not an area I'm too familiar with, hence wanted to see if there are any precious metal miner investing experts among us.

I came across PRU:ASX (Perseus Mining) - based on reserves - AISC vs. EV + budgeted CAPEX and expense commitments, it appears to offer a decent margin of safety, and also appears undervalued. Having said this, it also operates in West Africa, and I'm concerned about the geopolitical risk factors.

I've put together my calculations on Google sheets and would appreciate feedback from people well versed in Gold/Silver stocks, especially African based ones!

as part of my master's thesis, I examine the information content of credit rating changes on the German stock market. I am currently reading a dissertation in which the following is stated: *Under the assumption of a semi-strictly efficient market, the announcement of a credit rating reacts accordingly to the market at the time of publication (t\_0). If reactions can be found before the announcement (anticipation effects) or over-/under-reactions can be found afterwards, the assumption of a semi-strong efficient market has to be rejected.* The following picture then serves as an illustration:

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;blockquote class=""imgur-embed-pub"" lang=""en"" data-id=""pKjBDHM""&gt;&lt;a href=""[//imgur.com/pKjBDHM](//imgur.com/pKjBDHM)""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=""[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)"" charset=""utf-8""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

In a later paragraph the following is written:

*If, following on from the theory of Fama (1970), a semi-strong information efficiency is assumed on the securities markets, a price reaction in the context of an announced rating change would only be expected if the credit rating contains both public and non-public information, since public information has already been fully anticipated by the market.*

&amp;#x200B;

Are these not two contradictory statements? First, it is said that in a semi-strong efficient market, price changes may occur only on the day of announcement t\_0, so that a semi-strong efficient market can be assumed. The later paragraph then states that under the assumption of a semi-strong efficient market, the market has already fully anticipated the public information on the basis of which the rating was created.

I am confused by the statement that under the assumption of a semi-strong efficient market there should only be a reaction at time t0 but later it is written that in such a market it can be assumed that the public-available information has already been anticipated.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,379843,public,self,Credit Rating Change and the EMH,0,1563779462,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cfwevn/credit_rating_change_and_the_emh/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To;dr at the bottom...

“Earlier this month, Tesla  (NASDAQ:TSLA)  reported that it delivered a record 95,200 vehicles during the second quarter, bouncing back from a dreadful start to the year. (Deliveries totaled just 63,000 in the first quarter.) It also said that its order backlog increased last quarter. While Tesla hasn't released its full quarterly earnings report yet, this update seemed to indicate that the electric vehicle pioneer was getting itself back on track.
However, Tesla rolled out yet another series of price cuts and options adjustments earlier this week. This renews questions about the strength of demand. Furthermore, these changes could have other negative short-term and long-term impacts on Tesla's business.


In the latest update to its lineup, Tesla dropped the standard-range versions of the Model S and Model X again, after reintroducing them earlier this year. It has also reduced the price of the long-range variants. On balance, this means that the entry-level Model S price is about $5,000 higher in the U.S. today than it was a week ago. The increase was about $4,000 for the Model X. Customers buying the pricier performance package now get ""Ludicrous Mode"" included, rather than having to pay $20,000 extra for that option.


The price of the cheapest Model 3 variant available for online ordering decreased by $1,000 to $38,990. (The $35,000 base model is still available ""off-menu"" by phone.) The prices of several other options (or option packages) have been adjusted as well -- downwards, for the most part.


Tesla explained these moves as follows: ""We are also adjusting our pricing in order to continue to improve affordability for customers. Like other car companies, we periodically adjust pricing and available options.""


In reality, Tesla is changing its pricing and options at an unprecedented clip. By mid-March, it had already implemented four price changes this year, and there have been more adjustments since then. These frequent pricing changes are bad news for Tesla bulls.
Margin pressure is likely to continue
The most obvious risk for Tesla is that its price cuts will undermine its profitability. Tesla posted an ugly $702 million net loss in Q1 2019 after being solidly profitable in the second half of 2018. Automotive gross margin, excluding zero-emission vehicle credits and stock-based compensation, fell to 20.3% in the first quarter from 24.7% a quarter earlier.
The sharp drop in Tesla's deliveries drove part of that decline. However, Tesla acknowledged that price reductions and an unfavorable mix shift also contributed to its gross margin erosion.


The unfavorable mix shift continued last quarter, as the company began delivering the cheapest version of the Model 3 and sales of the pricier Model S and Model X continued to plunge. Price changes also put downward pressure on gross margin. As a result, most analysts believe that Tesla lost money in Q2 despite delivering a record number of vehicles.
It's true that in the latest round of adjustments, the entry-level prices for the Model S and Model X increased significantly. However, those starting prices are actually just $790 higher than they were in late April -- only customers are now getting a long-range battery rather than a standard battery for roughly the same price. That's great for buyers, but bad for Tesla's profitability.
Tesla is confusing -- and angering -- its customers
The endless stream of price changes this year is also having a more subtle negative impact on Tesla. For many years, the company distinguished itself from traditional automakers by not discounting its cars. As a result, customers could feel confident that they were getting a fair price when buying a Tesla, even though they were shelling out a lot of cash.



Today, with prices seeming to change every month -- sometimes dramatically -- customers don't know what the ""fair"" price is for any given Tesla vehicle. One recent repeat buyer was furious after Tesla staff urged him to buy his fully loaded Model 3 before the federal electric vehicle tax credit fell by $1,875 on July 1. He followed their advice -- but then Tesla cut the price of his car by more than $6,000 last week.
In the short run, highlighting an upcoming tax credit drop to drive sales and then cutting prices shortly after the tax credit declines to boost sales further is actually a clever way to sell more cars. But in the long run, the effects might not be so positive. In addition to angering customers who find that they overpaid, Tesla is confusing potential future buyers about what to expect with regard to pricing.
This could hurt sales in two ways. Potential buyers who expect further price cuts may hold out for those price cuts to materialize before ordering a vehicle. The expectation that prices will keep falling will also hurt trade-in values and drive up lease rates for Teslas.


Tesla needs to slow down
Falling battery costs and increasing economics of scale should allow Tesla to reduce its costs over time -- perhaps quite significantly. The company's ongoing moves to streamline its vehicle lineup will also reduce its costs by simplifying production. As a result, in the long run, Tesla should be able to turn a profit even with lower prices.
However, Tesla appears to be cutting prices too quickly relative to its cost reductions. Moreover, it has turned pricing into a game, which could confuse potential customers and even anger people who valued the company's no-haggle pricing policy. As a result, Tesla still has more work to do to stabilize its business.”

tl;dr : Tesla is increasing and decreasing prices and options on cars at a rapid rate, confusing and angering customers. Dropping prices could lead to more production but less earnings in the short term, but more gains in the long run (if they remain stable)



My thoughts are that Elon Musk loves the Tesla company and with the money he is making from SpaceX contracts to be able to build Starlink, Neuralink, The Boring Company and still have time for the OpenAI and the HyperLoop program, I’m in no doubt that he fill fund Tesla if worse comes to worst.

-Electric vehicles are all dependent on nickel.

Key takeaway: As car companies run into the need for more resources for the batteries, which will happen as people are forced to buy electric cars, they will need a supplier. Therefore you should invest long term (10-20 years) and add some solid mining companies to your portfolio.

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 22nd, 2019.

# **Week ahead: Earnings, GDP expected to show sluggish growth as investors await rate cut  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/19/earnings-gdp-to-show-sluggish-gains-as-some-see-big-rate-cut-coming.html)**
*****
&gt; Sluggish economic and earnings growth will be a theme in markets in the week ahead, as investors await a Fed interest rate cut at the end of the month.
*****
&gt; More than a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings in the coming week, the second big week of the second quarter reporting season. FAANG names, like Alphabet and Amazon, and blue chips from McDonald’s to Boeingand United Technologies are among the more than 130 companies reporting.
*****
&gt; There is also some key economic data, including Friday’s second quarter GDP, which should show a slowing to 1.8% from the first quarter’s 3.1% pace, according to Refinitiv. On Thursday, durable goods are reported and will include an update on businesses investment. There are also existing home sales Tuesday, new home sales Wednesday and advance economic indicators Thursday.
*****
&gt; But there will be no Fed speakers, after a parade of central bank officials in the past week, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The most impactful comments, however, came Thursday from New York Fed President John Williams, who set off a debate about how much the Fed could cut rates at its July 30-31 meeting — 25 or 50 basis points.
*****
&gt; Even as the New York Fed later said Williams comments were not about current policy, market pros took heed of his words about how central bankers should “act quickly.”
*****
&gt; Fed dominates
&gt; Fed officials do not speak publicly in the days ahead of policy meetings, but market pros will find plenty to debate. Fed funds futures were predicting a 43% chance of a 50 basis point cut in July, after shooting as high as 70% Thursday afternoon.
*****
&gt; “For sure, the Fed is going to dominate for next week. I think we’ll get at least a 25 basis point cut. I’m thinking we’re not going to get 50 basis point cut...The Fed has been burned when it’s been bold,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust.
*****
&gt; Roth said he believes the market is already pricing in a quarter-point cut, and he does not see the Fed’s rate cut as much of a longer-term catalyst for stocks. If it trims by a half percentage point, he expects just a short-term pop.
*****
&gt; Economists believe the Fed will cut interest rates even though recent data has improved. That’s in part because Powell has stressed the Fed is focused on the global economic slowdown, trade wars and low inflation, and that it will do what it takes to keep the economy expanding.
*****
&gt; “The only real catalyst that would really help the market would be if there was a trade deal with China,” Roth said. “I think the likelihood of that is less than &gt; 10%. We’re very pessimistic on the possibility of a real deal with China prior to the [2020 presidential] election.”
*****
&gt; So, in the void ahead of the Fed’s meeting, the market will be watching earnings. As earnings rolled out this past week, stocks took a rest from their record-setting streak, as some companies lowered forecasts and most beat earnings and revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; As of Friday morning, 77% of the roughly 80 companies reporting had beaten earnings estimates, and 65% topped revenue forecasts, according to Refinitiv. Based on actual reports and forecasts, earnings per share for the S&amp;P companies are expected to be up 1% in the second quarter. That is up from expectations that the profit growth would be slightly negative this quarter.
*****
&gt; “If you look at the numbers, we’re above the averages for top and bottom line beats, but at the same time when you look at revisions, every day we’re getting revisions for third and fourth quarter, and they’re coming down.There’s a real worry of an earnings recession, when you get out into the third and fourth quarter and out to next year,” Roth said.
*****
Roth said he’s currently neutral on risk assets, and he sees a slowdown brewing in the smallest U.S. companies that could spread up the food chain.
*****
&gt; “We do see those fundamental cracks in the economy in small business and the small business labor market, and on top of that you have these big macro risks out there,” such as trade and the upcoming election, Roth said.
*****
&gt; Slower economy
As earnings growth was muted in the second quarter, so was the pace of economic gains. If growth comes in as expected, it would be the first quarter where growth was under 2% since the first quarter of 2017. Economists are watching to see how consumer spending fared in the quarter, after a recent pickup and also whether business inventories are declining.
*****
&gt; “The data we need is not Q2. What’s at risk is the growth and magnitude of the Fed rate cut. I don’t think Q2 is going to have much impact on the Fed’s thinking,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It’s really how Q3 is progressing. It seems to me the economy softened in April and May and picked up in June with jobs data, retail sales and manufacturing sector.”
*****
&gt; Chandler said investors will also be focused on the European Central Bank, which some economists believe could cut its overnight deposit rate to negative 0.5% from negative 0.4% currently when it meets Thursday. Chandler said odds are about 50% for the rate cut, which many also expect in September.
*****
&gt; “While we’re waiting for the Fed to figure out whether it’s 25 or 50 basis points, and we’re waiting for the ECB to get all its forms sorted out ... the emerging markets are pushing ahead,” said Chandler, noting Russia and Turkey could cut rates in the next several days, after similar moves in the past week by South Africa, South Korea and Indonesia.
*****
&gt; “It just makes the story more global. You’re seeing the trade numbers from China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea weaken. You’re seeing exports form China suffer. Exports from all of Asia are suffering,” he said. “The big surprise for China and Japan has also been on the import side. The declines in their imports is really someone else’s [drop in] exports.”
*****
&gt; Rate cuts and currency wars
&gt; Dollar strength has been a consequence of the trade war, and Fed action could help turn it around.
*****
&gt; “If the Fed fails to move, you’re going to end up with an increasingly stronger dollar,” which impacts corporate earnings, Roth said.
*****
&gt; “The dollar is quite strong and is increasingly going to be a headwind for U.S. companies. It hasn’t appreciated that much in 12 months, but if we see a divergence in monetary policy between the U.S. and the rest of the world, you would see a carry trade develop where people would want to buy assets in the U.S.,” he said.
*****
&gt; The dollar index was slightly higher on the week, but Wall Street has been focused on President Donald Trump’s negative comments on the currency’s strength. As Trump has criticized the Fed, he also complains that other central banks manipulate their currencies to give them an edge in trade. Trump has said the Fed should already be cutting rates, something it hasn’t done since December 2008.
*****
&gt; A number of Wall Street strategists have said they now believe it is possible that the U.S. government could intervene to weaken the dollar, but that would be unlikely.

# Lagging Small-caps: Seasonal and Economic Factors Weigh

&gt; Small-caps measured by the performance of the Russell 2000 have been lagging since mid-March with the gap in performance widening in June and continuing into July. At yesterday’s close the Russell 2000 was up 15.35% year-to-date compared to a gain of 19.87% for the Russell 1000. Based upon historical trends this is not unusual for this time of the year nor during times when U.S. economic data is mixed.

&gt; In the following chart the one-year seasonal pattern of the Russell 2000/Russell 1000 has been plotted (solid black line with grey fill) along with 2019 year-to-date (blue line). This chart is similar to the chart found on page 110 of the 2019 Stock Trader’s Almanac. When the lines are rising small-caps are outperforming, when the lines are falling small-caps are lagging. Small-caps exhibited typical seasonal strength during the first quarter but have been fading ever since. In some years, small-cap strength can last until mid-June however, that is not the case this year. Going forward, small-cap underperformance is likely to persist until early in the fourth quarter with possible a hint of strength at the end of August.

# Robust Summer Rallies Trim Fall Pullbacks

&gt; It’s usually about this time of the year, when trading volumes begin to slump and markets meander that we begin to hear talk of the infamous “Summer Rally” featured on page 74 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019. The “Summer Rally” is usually the weakest seasonal rally of them all.

&gt; We looked at the current Summer Rally and found it to be above average already, up 10.2% from the Spring low on May 31, and that does portend well for the Summer and Fall Corrections. We lined up the Summer Rallies ranked from weakest to strongest since 1964. Over the past 55 years prior to this year DJIA has rallied and average of 9.1% from its May/June low until its Q3 high. The Fall Rally averages 10.9% and the Summer and Fall Corrections average a loss of just under 9% for a net average gain of a few percentage points over the summer and fall.

&gt; As shown in the table below, when the Summer Rally is greater than or equal to the 55-year 9.1% average, the summer and fall correction tend to be bit milder, -6.2% and -8.2%, respectively. Summer Rally gains beyond 12.5% historically had the smallest summer and fall corrections. One prominent exception being 1987.

# Earnings (and Guidance) Likely to Make or Break the Rally

&gt; Once again today, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ closed at new all-time highs. With today’s modest gains, DJIA is up 17.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 is even better at 20.2% while NASDAQ is still best at 24.5%. Compared to historical average performance in pre-election years at this time of the year, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are comfortably above average. NASDAQ’s impressive 24.5% gain is just average (since 1971). NASDAQ’s Midyear Rally delivered again, but officially ended last Friday. The seasonal pattern charts, above and below, along with July’s typical performance over the last 21 years suggest further gains during the balance of July and the third quarter could be limited. For the market to make meaningful gains in the near-term earnings will need to decent and forward guidance will also need to be firm.

# ""We Don't Need Your Stinking Data""

&gt; Yesterday was another one of those days that makes you scratch your head. In a relatively busy day for economic data, Initial Jobless Claims came in within 25K of a 50-year low, and the Philly Fed Manufacturing report saw its largest m/m increase in a decade. That follows other data last week where Retail Sales were very strong and CPI and PPI both came in ahead of consensus forecasts. The trend of better than expected data since the June employment report on July 5th is reflected in recent moves of the Citi Economic Surprise Index which has rallied from -68.3 up to -41.5. Granted, it’s still negative, but what was looking like a real dismal backdrop for the economy just three weeks ago seems to be showing signs of improvement.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/071819-Citi.png))**

&gt; On top of the economic data, two notable interviews from FOMC officials Williams from New York and Vice Chair Clarida moved markets. Given the strong tone of economic data, one would expect both officials to try and tone down rising market expectations regarding any aggressive policy moves at the July meeting. Well, markets don’t always make sense.

&gt; In their respective interviews, both Williams and Clarida not only didn’t tone down expectations, but they added fuel to the fire. Williams noted that “it pays to act quickly to lower rates"" and ""vaccinate” the economy ""against further ills."" Clarida was even more direct when he said that “Research shows you act preemptively when you can.” In other words, the data-dependent Fed is casting the data aside and ready to move anyway. In his interview on Fox Business, Clarida almost got a chuckle when asked whether there was any chance the Fed wouldn’t cut rates in July.

&gt; The dovish turn from the Fed was immediately reflected in market expectations for rate policy at the July meeting. Back in June, market expectations for a 50 basis points (bps) cut at the next meeting peaked out at under 50%. Then, in the days following the June employment report, expectations dropped all the way down to 3%. In the last ten days, though, the trend has completely reversed, and as of yesterday’s close topped out at 71% versus just a 29% chance for a 25 bps cut. Probabilities for a 50 bps cut came in a bit overnight but are still at about 50/50. Yesterday alone, though, expectations for a 25 bps cut and a 50 bps cut more than completely reversed from the prior day, and remember, that’s after what was a good day of economic data! Can you imagine what expectations would be like if the data was actually bad?

# US Beats World When It Comes to Stocks

&gt; The Bloomberg World index is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 stocks from around the world (including US stocks). While the S&amp;P 500 has been hitting new all-time highs over the last week, the Bloomberg World index remains 7% below highs that it last made back in January 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bworld.png))**

&gt; Below is a chart showing the ratio of the S&amp;P 500 to the Bloomberg World index since the World index's inception back in August 2003. While the World index outperformed the US for five years in the mid-2000s, the US has been outperforming since the end of 2007, which includes both the Financial Crisis and the bull market that has been in place since the 2009 lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/USvsworld.png))**

&gt; Along with the relative strength chart between the two indices above, below we show the price change of the S&amp;P 500 versus the Bloomberg World index since August 2003. Through today, the S&amp;P was up 203% versus a gain of 142% for the Bloomberg World index.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/percentchange.png))**

&gt; Since the November 2016 election, the S&amp;P 500 is up 40% versus a gain of 26% for the Bloomberg World index. Notably, the World index kept up with the S&amp;P through early 2018, but weakness for the World index in mid-2018 and a failure to bounce back as much as the US this year has left the World index well behind.

# Best Performing Stocks Over the Last 12 Months

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up over 20% YTD, but over the last 12 months, it is up just under 10% on a total return basis. And within the S&amp;P 1500, there are only 44 stocks that are up more than 50% on a total return basis over the last 12 months. These 44 stocks are listed below.

&gt; Innovative Industrials (IIPR) -- a cannabis REIT -- has been the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 1500 over the last year with a total return of 302%. In second place is eHealth (EHTH) with a gain of 269%, followed by Avon Products (AVP) at +174.8% and Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) at +128.58%. Coca-Cola Bottling is probably one of the last names you would have guessed as a top five performer over the last year! Other notables on the list of biggest winners include Advanced Micro (AMD), LendingTree (TREE), Starbucks (SBUX), AutoZone (AZO), Chipotle (CMG), Hershey (HSY), and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG).

&gt; Some names that aren't on the list that you may have expected to see? AMZN, NFLX, MSFT? Nope. None of the mega-cap Tech companies are on the list of biggest winners due to serious weakness from this group in Q4 2018.

# 2% Days Few and Far Between

&gt; Although the last two trading days have seen exceptionally narrow daily ranges, today we wanted to take a quick look at the S&amp;P 500's frequency of 2% daily moves (either up or down) in the post-WWII period. The chart below breaks out the frequency of 2% days by year, and years with more than 25 one-day moves of 2% are notated accordingly.

&gt; Overall, there have been an average of 11 daily 2% moves in a given year. After five straight years from 2007 to 2011 where we saw an above-average number of 2% days, the last seven years have only seen one year with an above-average number of occurrences (2018, 21). Remember, in 2017 there wasn't one single trading day that saw the S&amp;P move up or down 2%!

&gt; So far this year, there have only been four 2% days, but with the most volatile part of the year on tap, we are likely to see that number increase in the months ahead. Don't expect the relative calm that we have seen in the last few trading days to last forever. Volatility is unpredictable and usually comes up and surprises you when you least expect it!

The company’s strengths—including scale, value, and a vast library—may not be enough to make up for shortfalls in show quality. And no one, not even Netflix, can make a hit every time.

Before Netflix’s earnings report this past Wednesday, the bull case for the stock was that the streaming giant’s world-wide subscriber base of 150 million was still a starting point. Plus, there were millions of existing subscribers who wouldn’t balk at higher prices. 

But Netflix’s aura of invincibility is under question after the company stunned Wall Street with subscriber growth that came in nearly 45% lower than Netflix’s own projections.

For its second quarter, Netflix added 2.8 million net new international subscribers and lost 126,000 U.S. users, versus Wall Street expectations for 352,000 domestic additions and 4.8 million international adds. Netflix had forecast a total of five million new subscribers. The company’s shares fell 10% on Thursday, a day after the results. They fell another 3% on Friday. 

Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz noted that prior selloffs have proven to be buying opportunities for Netflix’s stock, but this time could be different. 

“Our two concerns that this dip may not be like the old times are: this is an unprecedented miss and competition is on the horizon,” Zgutowicz wrote in a report. “Netflix has never missed an international subscriber guide by this much.”

Pricing and content are the two critical issues in the disappointment. In its second-quarter letter to shareholders, the company said, “Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases.”

Netflix unveiled price increases in January. Its standard high definition streaming plan in the U.S. rose by 18% to $13 a month, but new pricing was rolled out gradually, perhaps giving a false impression of pricing power in the first quarter of the year. Given the June-quarter results, Netflix subscribers may still be rational consumers sensitive to higher costs. 

“The drop in U.S. subscribers suggests that viewers on lower pricing tiers dropped Netflix as a result of the price increase,” eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom wrote in an emailed statement.

The more worrisome issue may be content. Netflix admitted the weakness of its second-quarter releases were also a factor in its subscriber miss. 

“We don’t believe competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape,” the company said in its letter. “Rather, we think Q2 content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated.”

Netflix said its current quarter has started off strong thanks to the third season of Stranger Things, which was released earlier this month. That’s good news now, but it just confirms subscribers’ insatiable desire for engaging new content. Netflix is on the hook for a Stranger Things-like hit every quarter if it wants to hit its growth target. 

Rival content makers are no longer helping. In its latest investor letter, Netflix reminded shareholders that most of its Disney ￼ content, along with Friends and The Office, will leave the service in the coming years. According to third-party measurement services, Friends and The Office are two of the most-watched shows on Netflix. 

In June, NBCUniversal announced its new streaming service would have exclusive domestic streaming rights for The Office starting in 2021. Earlier this month, WarnerMedia said Friends would be exclusive its HBO Max service when it launches next spring. 

The company tried to minimize the departures by saying its most popular current titles are only a “low single digit percentage” of the streaming hours viewed and any content lost will free up money for other offerings. It will have to find those offerings in an increasingly competitive environment.

Disney is set to launch its new Disney+ streaming service on Nov. 12 at a price of $7 a month, about 45% lower than Netflix’s standard plan. In its first year, Disney plans to have a library of 7,500 TV episodes and 500 movies—including the company’s Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel films.

Even Netflix bulls admit that investors will be hyper-focused on further subscriber growth hiccups in the coming quarters.

“If Netflix misses subs in the quarters after Disney+ launches, the market will make the correlation anyway, and we expect the downside effect on Netflix stock will be several times more than usual,” Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger, who has an Outperform rating on Netflix shares, wrote last week.

So what is the setup for Netflix stock here? Last month, Barron’s said Netflix was priced for perfection and facing risk from increasing streaming competition. To be sure, we’ve been wrong on Netflix stock in the past, including in an August 2017 cover story. But the bearish argument may finally be playing out. 

Rising government scrutiny over the power of big technology companies also makes it unlikely there will be any near-term acquisition bid for Netflix, a longtime source of support for the stock. 

Even with the shares down 13% since early June, Netflix stock trades at 65 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months. The elevated multiple doesn’t seem to factor in the current risks.

Netflix ended its earnings call for investors this past week by congratulating competitor HBO for its record-breaking 137 Emmy nominations this year. 

“They continue to be the gold standard that we chase, and we’re really thrilled for them,” Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said.

That was a gracious gesture, but it’s also one more important reminder: Content always wins.

I'm trying to write about this purely from an investment standpoint. \n\nThe stock dipped earlier this year and is now trading at a price similar to when my previous post was made while the rest of the market has gone up by roughly 20%. What's changed since then is the JUUL stake. This has doubled the Net Debt/EBITDA to 2.7 and halved the interest coverage ratio to \\~7. I wouldn't call this a fortress balance sheet anymore, but I think the debt is manageable. \n\nMO currently has a market cap of $95B and one share trades for approx $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AbInBev** \n\nBUD currently has a market cap of $160B and accounts for roughly one in three beers sold across the world everyday. MO owns 10% of BUD, which means $16 billion of MO's market cap is their stake in BUD. While I'm not a fan of 3G's management style (KHC has turned out to be a mess), I do think they know what they're doing when it comes to the beer business. BUD is up 45% ytd compared to SPYs 20%. Management is taking steps to clean up their [balance sheet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-19/ab-inbev-sells-australia-unit-to-asahi-still-weighing-asia-ipo) after their acquisition of SABMiller.\n\n[Here's](https://www.amazon.com/Dethroning-King-Takeover-Anheuser-Busch-American-ebook/dp/B005UQLEJ0) a book that goes over their takeover of Anheuser Busch. 3Gs initial investment of $50 million into [Companhia Cervejaria Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companhia_Cervejaria_Brahma) in 1989 is worth approximately $40 billion in their BUD stake today. While I think their management style is too aggressive for my comfort, I'm perfectly fine with MO just holding their BUD stake and collecting the dividends. MO initially purchased Miller Brewing Company for $300 million in 1970. Today it's worth $16 billion through their BUD stake. They receive approx $550 million a year in dividends from BUD **after** the dividend cut. I don't expect people to stop drinking beer anytime soon, so even with little to no growth, this investment will continue to add cash to shareholders pockets for decades to come. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**JUUL**\n\nMO paid $13 billion for their 35% stake in JUUL. At the time of the purchase, MO valued JUUL at roughly 36x sales ($38 billion for the entire company), which seems very expensive. Here are my thoughts on the matter\n\n\\- MO had to admit defeat in the vaping space. Their vape products were getting crushed by JUUL and cigarette smokers were switching over as well. I think it was smart of management to stop fighting a losing battle and just use their balance sheet to team up with the winners instead. [It reminds me of a time when RIM didn't think AAPL was a threat.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rim-iphone/rim-co-ceo-doesnt-see-threat-from-apples-iphone-idUSN1236561320070212) Where would blackberry shareholders be today if RIM had decided to buy 35% of AAPL in 2007? \n\n\\- MO had an insight into JUULs growth trajectory [because they invested in a vape shop roughly a year before announcing their JUUL stake](https://www.richmond.com/business/local/altria-makes-a-minority-investment-in-a-rapidly-growing-chesterfield/article_4bf5caa8-0514-5936-87e3-e88f20d2c814.html). \n\n\\- JUUL realized their advantageous position when their biggest competitor came to them looking to team up. This allowed them to command a hefty premium.\n\n\\- [Sales grew 23% from Q12018 to Q12019 and showed strong international growth](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-11/juul-tells-investors-sales-are-climbing-again-despite-flavor-pullback).\n\nIt's hard to tell if the $13 billion price tag was justified, but I think it was a smart move from MO to hedge their bets while they could still afford to do it. [There's been rumors that JUUL is now valued at $50 billion](https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/juul-e-cigarette-maker-sees-its-valuation-top-38b/), so we'll assume $13 billion was a reasonable price to pay for the 35% stake. So $13 billion of the $95 billion is their stake in JUUL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CRON**\n\nMO also paid approx $2 billion for their 45% stake in CRON with warrants to up their stake to 55%. I don't follow the marijuana industry closely and I think it's too early to predict where CRON will be 20 years from now. I think the emphasis  for the company will be on cannabinoid extracts to be used in vapes, edibles etc. For what it's worth, I think MO is probably best suited to roll out marijuana products on a large scale when we see legalization at a federal level. They have a pretty lucrative tobacco business, extensive experience dealing with US lawmakers and an established relationship with retailers. So $2 billion of the $95 billion is their stake in CRON.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Philip Morris USA, US Smokeless Tobacco and the rest**\n\nThese are the wholly owned businesses that manufacture cigarettes, chewing tobacco, snus, cigars etc. These businesses account for all of the cash flow provided by operations on the balance sheet. Taking out the equity holdings mentioned above from the market cap puts the value of these businesses at approx $64 billion. \n\n\\- Cigarette volumes have been declining at a faster rate than previously expected. Smokeable volumes declined [by 7%](http://investor.altria.com/Cache/1001251868.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1001251868&amp;iid=4087349) compared to Q12018 as opposed to 4% as most analysts had predicted. \n\n\\- MO's smokeless tobacco unit has shown growth in the past and is [poised to show growth over the next 5 years.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/09/how-much-could-altrias-smokeless-products-division-grow-over-the-next-5-years/#44ce80c76f7a)\n\n\\- IQOS has been approved in the US which will offset some of the declines in cigarette volumes. \n\n\\- TTM free cash flow from aforementioned operations is approx $7.7 billion of which $5.6 billion were paid in dividends. Keep in mind MO targets a payout of approx 80% of earnings in dividends.  \n\nThis gives us a current free cash flow yield of approx 11% for the operating business as of today. This is a rough estimate of what the shareholders are paying for because this is money that goes towards paying dividends, paying off debt, buying back shares or making acquisitions. \n\nSome rough back of the envelope math tells us that assuming the cash flows show no growth and stay stable through price hikes and cost cutting at roughly $7.5 billion, we get our initial investment back in approx 10 years and anything following that is free money. If it declines at 7-8% a year, it'll take approx 20 years before the operating businesses reach 0 and we are left with the equity holdings for BUD, JUUL and CRON. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks to consider** \n\nHere are some risks to keep in mind\n\n\\-  [Cigarette volumes decline at a double digit rate.](https://www.cspdailynews.com/tobacco/cigarette-volume-down-115-nielsen-says)\n\n\\- More regulations/lawsuits against e-cigs if teen vaping isn't brought under control\n\n\\- CRON and/or JUUL investments turn out to be duds and lose market share to competitors. \n\n\\- IQOS doesn't gain traction in the US. \n\nThere's a good chance we'll see the share price drop to the low 40s in the near future if any of the above happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI'm pretty optimistic and I think the dividend is safe for the foreseeable future. The dividend hike this year will probably be low (around 4%), but with a yield over 6%, I'm happy to sit and wait to see how things pan out. (It's been raised 53 times in the last 49 years).\n\nIt is often joked that Altria is a law firm/lobby group that sells cigarettes on the side. I actually think they might have played a role in Dr. Gottlieb stepping down has head of the FDA. [Especially since he'd recently said he had no plans of doing so.](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article227145919.html) After the master settlement debacle of the late 90s, I think tobacco companies have learned to tread very carefully moving forward. I think they'll continue to generate profits and reward shareholders in the long run. I also think it's likely PM might buy PM USA from MO as more people switch from cigarettes to IQOS (Their current agreement is to split the revenues on IQOS sales). PM has over $35 billion in treasury stock, so they won't have too much trouble paying for the deal (I'm just speculating here). PM and MO are well known for being extremely shareholder friendly. I don't expect this to change going forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am long PM and MO."", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is meant to be a follow up to what I wrote roughly 7 months ago. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/a4esl5/the_case_for_altria_mo/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/a4esl5/the_case_for_altria_mo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to preface this by saying that I understand those who have a moral objection to investing in tobacco. I&amp;#39;m trying to write about this purely from an investment standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stock dipped earlier this year and is now trading at a price similar to when my previous post was made while the rest of the market has gone up by roughly 20%. What&amp;#39;s changed since then is the JUUL stake. This has doubled the Net Debt/EBITDA to 2.7 and halved the interest coverage ratio to ~7. I wouldn&amp;#39;t call this a fortress balance sheet anymore, but I think the debt is manageable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MO currently has a market cap of $95B and one share trades for approx $50. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AbInBev&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUD currently has a market cap of $160B and accounts for roughly one in three beers sold across the world everyday. MO owns 10% of BUD, which means $16 billion of MO&amp;#39;s market cap is their stake in BUD. While I&amp;#39;m not a fan of 3G&amp;#39;s management style (KHC has turned out to be a mess), I do think they know what they&amp;#39;re doing when it comes to the beer business. BUD is up 45% ytd compared to SPYs 20%. Management is taking steps to clean up their &lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-19/ab-inbev-sells-australia-unit-to-asahi-still-weighing-asia-ipo""&gt;balance sheet&lt;/a&gt; after their acquisition of SABMiller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dethroning-King-Takeover-Anheuser-Busch-American-ebook/dp/B005UQLEJ0""&gt;Here&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; a book that goes over their takeover of Anheuser Busch. 3Gs initial investment of $50 million into &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companhia_Cervejaria_Brahma""&gt;Companhia Cervejaria Brahma&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 is worth approximately $40 billion in their BUD stake today. While I think their management style is too aggressive for my comfort, I&amp;#39;m perfectly fine with MO just holding their BUD stake and collecting the dividends. MO initially purchased Miller Brewing Company for $300 million in 1970. Today it&amp;#39;s worth $16 billion through their BUD stake. They receive approx $550 million a year in dividends from BUD &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; the dividend cut. I don&amp;#39;t expect people to stop drinking beer anytime soon, so even with little to no growth, this investment will continue to add cash to shareholders pockets for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUUL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MO paid $13 billion for their 35% stake in JUUL. At the time of the purchase, MO valued JUUL at roughly 36x sales ($38 billion for the entire company), which seems very expensive. Here are my thoughts on the matter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- MO had to admit defeat in the vaping space. Their vape products were getting crushed by JUUL and cigarette smokers were switching over as well. I think it was smart of management to stop fighting a losing battle and just use their balance sheet to team up with the winners instead. &lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rim-iphone/rim-co-ceo-doesnt-see-threat-from-apples-iphone-idUSN1236561320070212""&gt;It reminds me of a time when RIM didn&amp;#39;t think AAPL was a threat.&lt;/a&gt; Where would blackberry shareholders be today if RIM had decided to buy 35% of AAPL in 2007? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- MO had an insight into JUULs growth trajectory &lt;a href=""https://www.richmond.com/business/local/altria-makes-a-minority-investment-in-a-rapidly-growing-chesterfield/article_4bf5caa8-0514-5936-87e3-e88f20d2c814.html""&gt;because they invested in a vape shop roughly a year before announcing their JUUL stake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- JUUL realized their advantageous position when their biggest competitor came to them looking to team up. This allowed them to command a hefty premium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-11/juul-tells-investors-sales-are-climbing-again-despite-flavor-pullback""&gt;Sales grew 23% from Q12018 to Q12019 and showed strong international growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to tell if the $13 billion price tag was justified, but I think it was a smart move from MO to hedge their bets while they could still afford to do it. &lt;a href=""https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/juul-e-cigarette-maker-sees-its-valuation-top-38b/""&gt;There&amp;#39;s been rumors that JUUL is now valued at $50 billion&lt;/a&gt;, so we&amp;#39;ll assume $13 billion was a reasonable price to pay for the 35% stake. So $13 billion of the $95 billion is their stake in JUUL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MO also paid approx $2 billion for their 45% stake in CRON with warrants to up their stake to 55%. I don&amp;#39;t follow the marijuana industry closely and I think it&amp;#39;s too early to predict where CRON will be 20 years from now. I think the emphasis  for the company will be on cannabinoid extracts to be used in vapes, edibles etc. For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I think MO is probably best suited to roll out marijuana products on a large scale when we see legalization at a federal level. They have a pretty lucrative tobacco business, extensive experience dealing with US lawmakers and an established relationship with retailers. So $2 billion of the $95 billion is their stake in CRON.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philip Morris USA, US Smokeless Tobacco and the rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the wholly owned businesses that manufacture cigarettes, chewing tobacco, snus, cigars etc. These businesses account for all of the cash flow provided by operations on the balance sheet. Taking out the equity holdings mentioned above from the market cap puts the value of these businesses at approx $64 billion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Cigarette volumes have been declining at a faster rate than previously expected. Smokeable volumes declined &lt;a href=""http://investor.altria.com/Cache/1001251868.PDF?O=PDF&amp;amp;T=&amp;amp;Y=&amp;amp;D=&amp;amp;FID=1001251868&amp;amp;iid=4087349""&gt;by 7%&lt;/a&gt; compared to Q12018 as opposed to 4% as most analysts had predicted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- MO&amp;#39;s smokeless tobacco unit has shown growth in the past and is &lt;a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/09/how-much-could-altrias-smokeless-products-division-grow-over-the-next-5-years/#44ce80c76f7a""&gt;poised to show growth over the next 5 years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- IQOS has been approved in the US which will offset some of the declines in cigarette volumes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- TTM free cash flow from aforementioned operations is approx $7.7 billion of which $5.6 billion were paid in dividends. Keep in mind MO targets a payout of approx 80% of earnings in dividends.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This gives us a current free cash flow yield of approx 11% for the operating business as of today. This is a rough estimate of what the shareholders are paying for because this is money that goes towards paying dividends, paying off debt, buying back shares or making acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some rough back of the envelope math tells us that assuming the cash flows show no growth and stay stable through price hikes and cost cutting at roughly $7.5 billion, we get our initial investment back in approx 10 years and anything following that is free money. If it declines at 7-8% a year, it&amp;#39;ll take approx 20 years before the operating businesses reach 0 and we are left with the equity holdings for BUD, JUUL and CRON. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks to consider&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some risks to keep in mind&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-  &lt;a href=""https://www.cspdailynews.com/tobacco/cigarette-volume-down-115-nielsen-says""&gt;Cigarette volumes decline at a double digit rate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- More regulations/lawsuits against e-cigs if teen vaping isn&amp;#39;t brought under control&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- CRON and/or JUUL investments turn out to be duds and lose market share to competitors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- IQOS doesn&amp;#39;t gain traction in the US. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a good chance we&amp;#39;ll see the share price drop to the low 40s in the near future if any of the above happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty optimistic and I think the dividend is safe for the foreseeable future. The dividend hike this year will probably be low (around 4%), but with a yield over 6%, I&amp;#39;m happy to sit and wait to see how things pan out. (It&amp;#39;s been raised 53 times in the last 49 years).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is often joked that Altria is a law firm/lobby group that sells cigarettes on the side. I actually think they might have played a role in Dr. Gottlieb stepping down has head of the FDA. &lt;a href=""https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article227145919.html""&gt;Especially since he&amp;#39;d recently said he had no plans of doing so.&lt;/a&gt; After the master settlement debacle of the late 90s, I think tobacco companies have learned to tread very carefully moving forward.

Alphabet Inc.’s growth is slowing, and analysts don’t have a clue as to why because executives aren’t talking.

Deciphering where the revenue fell short was complicated by the way Alphabet structures its segments. There are three major businesses listed on the earnings report: Advertising (which includes search and YouTube); “Other revenues” (a mix of hardware, Google Cloud, and its app store); and “Other Bets” (a collection of upstart ventures that lose money). That’s the extent of the disclosure, which leaves investors in the dark on performance of specific properties like YouTube and Google Cloud.

# **Safe(-ish) stocks**
Short list of the safest stocks that I would say reliably will grow in the next few years. Of course a correction might occur (US markets crash) but I would say that you can reliably count on these companies to keep performing relatively well and not really be shoved out of the market and won't be going bankrupt unless an apocalypse happens

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Amazon** - Not going to be replace/out-competed any time soon unless government steps in. I'd say the safest of any (tech or any really besides maybe Berk stock) stock barring gov't intervention. Who actually can replace Amazon?
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Microsoft-** Has huge market share in Operating systems/competing actively with big names like amazon. Gamings-XBOX. They just have such a big basket of different assets so at least some of them have to succeed right?
&amp;nbsp;

**Google** - Best search engine, youtube, not being replaced any time soon Who knows what they have in the pipeline/working on Like  Again Gov’t might step in.

&amp;nbsp;

**(not tech but anyone can see it)**

**Disney** - Stranglehold on good IP's (Marvel, Pixar, everything, Disney stuff) Anyone can see that they are printing money with their movies with nostalgia and with their bucket of IPs, anyone with eyes can predict that they will continue printing money for awhile.

&amp;nbsp;


#**Riskier Investments**:
**AMD**- Strong growth and good outlook but a lot smaller than Intel and nvidia. Maybe a breakaway, but growing in market share. A bit too high in price right now so maybe buy when it dips? Their latest product are really good and if they keep making new products that are with the same standard of out-performing Intel then they can only go up, but maybe that is already priced in with how much their stock has gone up over the year which is why I placed it here in the riskier section.

**Intel** - Outlook currently isn’t really good so maybe a good buying opportunity. They will be very competitive with AMD, and might win the war vs AMD but they basically own the chip market currently(largest market share). We'll see what happens with ther next generation of chips on if they can edge out AMD.

**APPLE** - Lagging far behind the other tech companies so I would say it's riskier, however they do have a TON of fucking cash on hand to make whatever they are working on whether it's the best $1000 monitor stand or random ass phone accessories. Who knows, what if they make the next-gen product like what the original""Iphone"" was.

&amp;nbsp;

##Cyber security:
Security in tech is always growing and will be relevant so maybe it's time to invest but you never know, so it belongs in riskier investments.

&amp;nbsp;

**OKTA** - done pretty well so far, can't really complain about their outlook

**ZS** - Zscaler is a  global cloud-based information security company that provides Internet security, web security, firewalls, sandboxing, SSL inspection, antivirus, vulnerability management and granular control of user activity in cloud computing, mobile and Internet of things environments.
Cloud security sounds pretty good, with all the other goodies involved.

 However I bet big companies like AMZN and Cisco already have most of their security underwraps but maybe in the future they outsource the effort to more specialized companies like ZS and OKTA in the future. As more things get modernized Internet Security seems like sector that will only grow as more companies get modernized and Cloud is the future so maybe early investing in a cloud security company will pay off in the long run.

##Tech tools:
**SPLK** - This made my list because this is one of the companies with a great product that is in a special niche which is growing. They produce software for searching, monitoring, and 
analyzing machine-generated big data, **Big data, Neural Nets, BIG BUZZ WORD INSERT HERE**. This company makes software that processes large amounts of data, and every tech company are trying to amass as much data as possible from
their clients, and a company that specializes in big data analysis  seems like a good idea after all the companies want to train their own neural nets to gather as much business data as possible.

Splunk's mission is to make machine data accessible across an organization by identifying data patterns, providing metrics, diagnosing problems, and providing intelligence for business operations

So they basically handle analyzing big data for companies that don't want to invest in that field or smaller companies who don't have the capital to homegrow this division so I'd say keep an eye on it.

##Social Media-**Yuck**
I wouldn’t touch it with a 50 foot pole, but if you’re looking at social media companies, Facebook will be #1.

**Facebook** - has instagram and everything else. Facebook is still a massive company who everyone at least knows someone who uses it. Instagram is huge, I doubt they are going anywhere soon, but it’s social media. 

**Twitter** - President Trump uses it exclusively. Enof said. ( I am considering moving this to YOLO but I don't wanna make another section down there)


#Risky YOLO
What I classify as really risky things to invest in right now. Aim for the moon and if you miss maybe you land on some stars.

**TSLA** - YOLO classic. Good product but CEO questionable but they might be farther ahead than others in the self-driving car but Google is also working on this and no-one really knows how far away self-driving cars re. Still it's 100% a YOLO. 

**NFLX** - Weak earnings slower growth and lower subscription growth(missed by a mile) and competition from disney/other people launching streaming sites. Who knows they might bounce back, they had a pretty sizable head start on the streaming side and perfecting their platform. Maybe the other streaming services fizzle out, but don’t rely on it. I think it’s valued too high right now but they did dip recently, so maybe it’s worth buying the dip, but that is very very risky. They can still grow, as the cable industry is still here, and their revenue is growing. We’ll see next quarter but for now it’s in the YOLO 


**Nvidia** (who knows what they are doing) - owns most of the graphic card industry and crypto is bouncing back kinda? So maybe they improve?

This is a very beginner question, but what is the inherent value of a stock? I understand the concept of buying when supply is high and selling when demand is high, but why does anyone want to own a stock in the first place? Do all companies pay a dividend or a cash payout to their share holders?

\- Let's say I purchase a stock from Amazon with the intention to \*never\* sell. How do I make a profit (what value do I gain just by holding it)? Where do I find that information before I purchase a stock?  
\- Let's say for whatever reason everyone in the entire world stopped trading stocks for a certain company. Do the prices on those stocks go up as the company becomes more successful? Or are the prices of stocks ultimately up to the people trading on the market?

I'd like to share my analysis on Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG):

&amp;#x200B;

Alphabet is the parent company of Google. The company has many well-known services with billions of active users each: Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Android, Google Play and Chrome.

&amp;#x200B;

In this post, instead of focusing on these services, **I am going to expand on less-known areas where I believe the company has huge growth opportunities**.

&amp;#x200B;

**🚙Self-driving and ridesharing**

&amp;#x200B;

* Alphabet is the parent company of Waymo (formerly known as Google self-driving car project). This company is considered the leader in the self-driving industry. On October 2018, Waymo announced that their driverless cars had already driven more than 10 million miles on public roads and 7 billions on virtual environments, this is far beyond all its competitors combined. The company has already set up partnerships with Fiat, Lyft, AutoNation, Avis, Intel and Jaguar Land Rover.
* Waymo has already started to test a self-driving taxi service in Arizona, and it's also testing self-driving trucks in that State. According to Intel, self-driving industry could generate $800B in revenue by 2035, Waymo is on-track to be a leader on that industry.
* Alphabet owns an estimated stake of 5% in Uber and 5% in Lyft, thanks to investments made by its subsidiaries GV and CapitalG respectively. One of CapitalG's partners is even on Lyft’s board.

&amp;#x200B;

**📈Investments and venture capital**

&amp;#x200B;

* Alphabet is the parent company of CapitalG and GV.
* CapitalG invests in growth stage tech companies and helps them scale with support from Google’s vast expertise and resources. One of the key assets of this company is its connection with Google. CapitalG identifies where they can add value in the companies they are investing in, and connect these companies with Google experts.
* CapitalG has a portfolio with many large and promising companies, including: Snapchat, Airbnb, Lyft, Looker, Stripe, SurveyMonkey, Glassdoor, Zscaler, Duolingo and Cloudflare.
* GV is a venture capital firm which provides seed, venture, and growth stage funding to tech companies. Their portfolio also includes many large and promising companies, including: Uber, Jet, Medium, Nest, Lime and Slack.
* 🚀 Alphabet also owns an estimated stake of 7.5% in SpaceX. The company has an estimated value of $30B and it's growing fast.

&amp;#x200B;

**☁ Cloud Services**

&amp;#x200B;

* On the last quarter, the headcount growth in the cloud division was the company’s biggest increase in operating expense. Google is the 3rd biggest cloud service provider and it's investing heavily to catch up with AWS and Azure.
* The cloud industry is growing fast, but Google Cloud is growing even faster. The company offers great products, but I would highlight especially their AI and Big Data solutions. Google also has an extra edge on AI, thanks to its TPU chip. This chip has been designed specifically for running Google's TensorFlow framework and can be many times faster than conventional chips.
* On April, Google announced a new platform called Anthos, which will allow customers to deploy and manage their applications multi-cloud, including on AWS or Azure.

&amp;#x200B;

**👾Cloud Gaming**

&amp;#x200B;

* Google announced that its new cloud gaming platform Stadia will launch to 14 countries in November. The platform will have a free-to-play version with lower resolution and a subscription plan for $10 a month which will provide: 4K resolution, a selection of free games and exclusive discounts.

&amp;#x200B;

**🤖Artificial Intelligence**

&amp;#x200B;

* Alphabet owns DeepMind, this company has been consistently achieving major breakthroughs on AI. The company made headlines multiple times on the last years, for instance, when it beat a professional player at the game of go and when it beat professional players at StarCraft II. But DeepMind is doing far more than training AI on games. In December, DeepMind's AlphaFold demonstrated that it could predict protein structures far better than any existent technology. This advance can have a huge impact on how drugs are developed and it can allow to better diagnose and treat diseases that are believed to be caused by misfolding proteins, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
* DeepMind also collaborates with Google solving tough problems with AI. For instance they reduced Google's data center cooling bill by 40% and improved text-to-speech quality for Google Assistant and Google Cloud.
* Google is also investing heavily on AI and it's using it across the entire company in order to improve internal processes and external products.
* Google Pixel phones use AI in order to improve its camera, battery and user experience.
* Google's applied science team partnered up with TAE Technologies with the ambitious objective of developing clean, safe and commercial Fusion Energy, by applying machine learning to the experimentation process.

I hope this post was useful for anyone interested in investing in the company.

If anyone is interested, I keep all the stocks in my portfolio up to date here: [https://mpcapital.ai/](https://mpcapital.ai/)

I also try to publish different metrics and stats on companies on my portfolio. My objective is to trade as transparent as possible, all my trades are publicly registered on [my eToro profile](https://www.etoro.com/people/marianopardo/stats).

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

Boeing says it will take a $4.9 billion charge in the second quarter.

People will gravitate towards streaming services that apply to their tastes like HBO shows, Disney shows and eventually everyones brother, mother, father will stop subscribing in lieu for their own streaming taste prefecences and no one will be there to take on their own subscription of Netflix. Once this occurs Netflix's subscriber numbers will drop off like flies. Essentially this argument would apply to all streaming services but since this effects Netflix's entire business model I am going to to focus on it almost entirely.

I'm basing my decision to invest in Hasbro largely on Magic the Gathering. Mtg is the most successful collectible card game ever made, and I played it 20ish years ago. Printing these cards is basically like printing money, and new sets are released about 3 - 4 times a year. I recently started playing again when Wizards of the Coast (owned by Hasbro) released MTG Arena, a free to play online version of Magic that has a lot more mainstream appeal and has brought a lot of new players into the game as well as motivated a lot of old players like myself to return. Hasbro has also been pushing esports and tabletop championship events for Magic and there are large competitive events across the world 20+ times per year. I feel like this is going to create a large boost in online and physical card sales. Anything selling chance based collectible digital items seems like huge profit potential with near zero production cost and physical card players are constantly motivated to buy more product for a chance to get better cards. 

Aside from magic, they have Nerf, Transformers, Monopoly and a few other Franchises. They just got out from under the Toys R Us bankruptcy, there is a big budget Magic the Gathering movie being produced by Netflix set to release in 2021  and after the poor performance of the 2017 Power Rangers movie Hasbro bought the rights to that franchise as well.

I've been following Workhorse for about a month and I'm wondering if now is a good time to buy.

Specifically, there is an upcoming $6.3 billion contract that the United States Postal Service is planning on giving to one of five potential truck companies. Workhorse and VT Hackney teamed up to make an electric mail truck, and they are competing with AM General, Mahindra, Oshkosh and Ford, and Karsan Otomotive. What is the likelihood that they will land this deal?

The prospect of a contract between USPS and Workhorse is very intriguing. Shares of Workhorse soared by 18% Monday, most likely out of speculation regarding this deal, but fell 5% Tuesday.

I’ve been meaning to do a post on Costco for some time because it appears people don’t really understand their business model except that they are retailers.

The genius of Costco is all in their margin moat

They cap margin on all standardized products at 15% with the exception of jewelry and travel but it’s still pretty low.

For those that do not understand margin it’s buying something for 100 and selling for 115.

This margin practice has severely limited Costco in the past, but as their sales and same store COMPs continue to dazzle, analysts are beginning to realize how safe of an investment this truly has become.

Costco can effectively underbid every other retailer with their business model. Their focus on low margin churn with a membership focus allows for customers to return over and over again. As all family shoppers at Costco know, you simply lose money not shopping there.

It has been reported but I also have an insider source at the company that they are breaking into international markets, specifically China.

Domestic growth is slowing and once international markets understand the deep value Costco gives their customers, the value will easily get to 500 billion by 2030. Domestic stores to be released will slow to 5-10 and international will be 25-30.

They do have a couple points of weakness that are frustrating but as I said, analysts are looking past them.

They sell some items at a loss, rotisserie chicken has a negative margin and the hot dogs as well. But they dramatically make that up with other shopping practices. 

They are beginning to raise their own chickens in Nebraska and Illinois, and hot dogs are around the corner.

I honestly don’t see how other retailers will compete. However diversification is an issue but they do have a wealth of outside business models through the membership.

Travel has been pushed along with e-commerce. The higher the margin the better, but again not outlandish. Always trying to find a deal.

I believe they will take a crack at Home Depot and Lowe’s soon as they already have business centers throughout the country. These centers serve restaurants, hospitals, and other small businesses with service related and bulk purchases. Massive containers of candies and napkins, things that businesses need in bulk and cheap. Their delivery service in this sector is growing as well. I could see laundry and uniforms coming soon.

The sky is really the limit for Costco going into the next decade.

It’s already rewarded 16% compounded for the last 30 years.

Key positives - Margin moat, phenomenal operational execution, modest dividend that will grow, difficult for other retailers to compete.

Key negatives - Intentional lose money on things to breed customer loyalty, macro population trends in developed countries (less larger families), membership pushes people away from purchasing at the store, but let’s be honest they have 99 million members.

Continue to buy Costco long term guys, they aren’t going away for a long.

Info - I work directly with Costco in a business relationship, they inform us of moves they will make generally speaking and show us how the clock ticks. Nothing inside trading but fascinating stuff.

3) Financial advisors cost a ton and are out of the range of people who want to invest a portion of their earnings. Most people (including myself) live paycheck to paycheck. When people suggest or advise others to consult a financial advisor, I usually think that person is privileged and out of touch with reality.

4) Financial advisors are also a bad idea because fiduciary duty or not, nobody is going to care about your money more than you will. I'm surprised people haven't learned from 2008-2009. The only calls small-time investors received from these financial advisors (if they received a call to begin with) was, ""I'm sorry.""

And in general, does a CEO selling his stock put you completely off a stock that seems otherwise positive?

I am a stock investor investing a really small amount of money into individual stocks. I became interested in this stock $ZYXI in search of a medical company that focuses on an area I believe is growing (pain management through TENS units vs. opioids). My wife suffers chronic pain and works in the medical industry so I have personal experience with this area (she does not work with any companies that makes or uses these devices). That lead me to this stock. At least on the surface for me it has positive signs.. increased profits for the last 11 quarters, an investment into sales force to sell more of their product, a new product in a different medical area which is undergoing CE and FDA approval, largest competitor (EMPI) shut down by OIG, other things.

It also has things which may or may not be positive but sound good to me. The company is recently added to NASDAQ and the Russel 2000, small institutions seem to be buying this stock, or at least they bought small amounts around March or May. Analysts list the stock at near value and have a buy recommendation (2 analysts). When I bought this stock, Schwab did not have any rating for it but in July they did a Schwab ratings report on it and have it listed as ""B"" ranking overall and ""Buy"".

The major problem that seems to have caused the stock to slide to its current level is that the CEO filed to sell his shares. He currently owns &gt; 50% of the company. I hear all kinds of stuff like ""the ceo met with investors and he needs to sell some stock to increase liquidity"", and other things like that. I have no idea how to evaluate this other than I read that CEO's sell their stock for a variety of reasons. I don't know if he is selling all of his stock or not, I think the filing is for all of it but I am unclear if that means he has to or will sell it all. The company will report earnings July 30th.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

* *Tuesday*: **Domino's Pizza (DPZ)** will report earnings (before market open)
* *Tuesday*: **Oracle (ORCL)** ex-dividend date (0.24 per share will be paid on July 31, 2019)
* *Wednesday*: **IBM (IBM)** will report earnings (after market close)
* *Wednesday*: **Netflix (NFLX)** will report earnings (after market close)

&amp;#x200B;

**More news and developments:**

&amp;#x200B;

* The Federal Trade Commission approved a $5 billion settlement with **Facebook (FB)** over the Cambridge Analytica privacy violations. The stock moved higher after the announcement as investors were expecting a worst outcome.
* **Tesla (TSLA)** Model 3 earns a 5-Star Safety Rating from the European New Car Assessment Programme. Model 3 has already earned an overall 5-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, including earning 5 stars in every category and sub-category, and scoring the lowest probability of injury of any car ever evaluated by the U.S. New Car Assessment Program.
* **American Airlines (AAL)** extends flight cancellations into early November because of **Boeing (BA)** 737 Max grounding. The airline said in a statement that it is confident the aircraft will be recertificated this year.
* **Google (GOOG)** incubator Area 120 launched a new social network called ""Shoelace"". The app promises to ""supercharge your social life"" by connecting people together based on their interests and providing curated lists of nearby events. At the moment the app is only available in New York.
* Trump tweeted on Friday criticising BTC and **Facebook (FB)** cryptocurrency Libra, branding them as ""unregulated crypto assets"" and ""based on thin air."" This is the first time the president publicly mentioned cryptocurrencies. This tweet could increase tensions as a second US Congressional hearing is scheduled on Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency. A day earlier, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that Libra should not go forward until Facebook addresses concerns around data privacy, money laundering and consumer protection.

The strip mall retailer has been struggling like other retailers in recent years and has been closing down unprofitable stores and focusing on boosting margins and sales in its core stores.  It seems to be paying off with the 8% increase in comps in June following a 1% increase in May.  This follows a jump in profits for 2018 to $30.5 million when the CEO said the business had stabilized and he was optimistic about 2019. However, also very noteworthy, is the valuation.  With the stock down nearly 70% it trades on an mcap of just $350 million, it has zero debt and a relatively huge cash position of $210 million.  With an improving outlook that equates to a cash adjusted PE of just 4.6.

“When a individual with cash meets an experienced individual, that individual with experience ends up with cash and that individual with cash leaves with experience.“.This was Warren Buffett’s response, when asked about his best investment advice. Warren Buffett says that experience is the ultimate key to be a successful investor.

One of Buffett’s most famous quotes is “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”

Warren Buffett is considered to be one of the best long-term investor, so it’s no wonder many people like to listen closely to Buffett’s words of wisdom, in order to apply them to their own lives. With that in mind, here are Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips

Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips

Investing is long term Game

Money doesn’t grow overnight, by getting nine women pregnant you can’t make a child in a month. No matter how good the talent or attempts are, Warren Buffett is just saying some things take time.

Investment planning should be done by considering long term goal. Investor goes for futures and options with the hope of making quick money but they are actually the one who loses more money.

Warren Buffett never did trading (Intraday or Positional). Warren Buffett also says “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.”

Diversification isn’t always a good idea

Many good investors says diversification is good idea for investment in stock market. But Warren Buffett tends to disagree with the idea.

Warren Buffett suggests diversification is for individuals who have little knowledge of investment. An experienced investor should select long-term stocks and have confidence in their investments.

“Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing.” – Warren Buffett

Some investors diversify their portfolios because they are afraid that any one stock might sink their entire portfolio; but, while doing so, it becomes much harder to keep focus on individual investments. They may decrease their portfolio’s volatility by diversifying, but at the same moment decrease their focus on individual investments.

Excessive diversification also means that a portfolio is likely invested in a number of businesses, diluting the impact from its high quality holdings.

“The idea of excessive diversification is madness.” – Charlie Munger

Don’t invest in a company whose business you don’t understand

This is one of the most important Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips. People invest their hard earn money just by hearing something good about the particular company from others. You can determine if there will be any related economic issues in the future by knowing the company. In the stock market, there are many firms whose company can be understood by any ordinary individual. Buffett warns you should never invest in companies you don’t comprehend completely.

Trust yourself to be a successful investor

Warren Buffett says that the hardest thing is to trust your investment decisions. You always think that others are right and you are wrong. Instead, you need to study and believe in yourself.

“I always knew I was going to be reach. I don’t think I doubted for a minute”- Warren Buffett

To be successful, you need to overcome the fear and not pay attention to what others are telling you. Accumulate understanding and create investment choices to stand apart from the crown and be a winner on your own.

Think like an owner

Warren Buffett always says in his interview, you have to thinking like an owner changes your whole views on stock investing.  Warren Buffett says if you are going to own a new car/bike, you will think about its fair valuation, you will think about its features and you will compare it with cars/bike offered by other manufacturers from the same segment. Then you’ll decide which one to purchase after reviewing everything. Similarly, stocks should have the same view.

Prefer quality stocks than cheap stocks

A lot of people buy stocks just because they are cheap without understanding that cheap is not always better. Charlie Munger’s Buffett discovered that “buying a great company at a fair price is far better than buying a fair company at a great cost.” Chances of losing money in cheap stocks are very high compared to investment in a fairly valued stock

There’s no room to be emotional

“Some individuals are not supposed to own stocks at all because they are too annoyed by price changes. If you’re going to do stupid things because your inventory is going down, you shouldn’t own a stock at all, “Warren Buffett said during a cnbc interview. Some people aren’t really mentally or psychologically fit for their own stock, but I believe more of them would be,” Buffett said if they were more informed about what they’re actually purchasing, which is component of a company

Nvidia stock will rise because gamers are growing more interested in the latest features of its graphics cards, according to Piper Jaffray.

The back story. Nvidia shares (ticker: NVDA) are up about 25% this year, roughly matching the Nasdaq Composite, which has risen nearly 24%. The stock is still down about 43% from last year’s highs.

In May, Nvidia said it was difficult to predict demand in the data-center segment of its business as it withdrew the full-year guidance it had given just a few months earlier.

This month, the company is releasing 3 new graphics cards to battle increasing competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in the gaming market.

What’s new. Piper Jaffray analyst Harsh Kumar reaffirmed his Overweight rating for Nvidia stock, citing positive results in his firm’s survey of gamers.

“NVIDIA recently introduced its ray tracing [better lighting effects capable] GPUs, and according to the company, initial demand has been solid,” he wrote. “Based on our survey results, we believe initial demand is also off to a good start.”

Nvidia shares were up 1.1% to $168.07 Friday morning.

The analyst predicts demand will improve as more games support the “ray tracing” technology of Nvidia’s graphics cards. He cited how 70% of the gamers who were surveyed said they were maintaining or increasing spending on graphics cards.

Looking ahead. Kumar reiterated his $200 price target for Nvidia shares.

FTC REPORTEDLY HITS FACEBOOK WITH RECORD $5 BILLION SETTLEMENT

￼

LAUREN JOSEPH; AARON BERNSTEIN/REUTERS

AFTER MONTHS OF negotiations, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record-setting $5 billion on Friday for privacy violations, according to multiple reports. The penalty comes after an investigation that lasted over a year, and marks the largest in the agency’s history by an order of magnitude. If approved by the Justice Department's civil division, it will also the first substantive punishment for Facebook in the US, where the tech industry has gone largely unregulated. But Washington has taken a harsher stance toward Silicon Valley lately, and Friday’s announcement marks its most aggressive action yet to curb its privacy overreaches",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,376616,public,self,Facebook fined $5 billion for privacy violations,0,1563051363,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ccgj39/facebook_fined_5_billion_for_privacy_violations/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have 1k dollars sitting at the bank atm and I want to do something productive with them. I'm not currently in the US so I opened an account with a broker in Argentina and the commissions to trade in Wall Street are pretty high (minimum of 12USD per transaction). This applies for both ETFs and stocks. Because of this, I don't plan to trade often, but to divide the 1k on 2 or 3 stocks/ETFs. I am currently employed but I might or might not need the money over the course of the next 5 years (in case of an emergency, say). I'd like to split my portfolio between as many  stocks as possible but I really can't because of the huge rates. Should I put all my eggs in one basket? And in that case, which basket do you guys recommend? (Risk tolerance: low to moderate).

This article also goes into current solutions such as burning, sorting, cleaning waste, and new/more efficient ways of processing and re-using recycled waste. So I just want to open a discussion about what companies will benefit the most from this large increase in waste over the next decade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, there are stocks like:

**Waste Management and Services**

**WM** \- Waste Management -  is an American waste management, comprehensive waste, and environmental services company in North America (largest in NA)

**RSG** \- Republic Services -  provides non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling, and disposal services for commercial, industrial, municipal, and residential customers in the United States 

**ABM** \- ABM Industries - provides integrated facility solutions services in the United States and internationally. 

**WCN**  \- Waste Connections -  an integrated municipal solid waste (MSW) services company, provides solid waste collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling services primarily in the United States. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are just companies that directly handle and manage waste. There are other companies that are solving problems by creating bio-plastics, producing energy from waste, optical sorting of waste, and aerobic/anaerobic digestion with enzymes.

&gt;Boeing has bested Airbus as the world's largest aircraft maker for most of this decade. That's about to change in dramatic fashion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Airbus has already delivered 150 more jets than Boeing through the first six months of the year: Airbus is winning 389 to 239, according to sales figures reported this week. Airbus' commanding lead is especially significant because the race between the two companies has historically been tight. Last year, for example, Boeing delivered 806 aircraft last year to Airbus' 800. 2015 was the only year this decade in which one of the two airplane manufacturers delivered 100 more planes than the other.The gap between them is almost certainly going to get wider. Boeing has not been able to deliver any of its bestselling 737 Max planes since March, when those jets were grounded. That month, one of the jets crashed in Ethiopia and killed all 157 people on board. It was the second fatal crash of a 737 Max in less than six months. In total, 346 people died aboard the two planes. Boeing probably won't get approval to fly the 737 Max again until the end of 2019 at the earliest — much later than what was initially expected.Boeing and Airbus dominate the commercial aircraft market, and both companies have a backlog of thousands of jets that will keep them busy making planes for years to come. That has kept new orders modest for both companies, even before the 737 Max grounding.Investors view deliveries as a more important metric of success than orders. Airlines don't pay most of the price of a new jet until it is delivered, meaning that the aircraft makers' revenue, profits and cash flow depend upon deliveries.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The good news for both companies is that the demand for air travel, and new fuel-efficient planes, is growing. That means both are building and delivering planes at a much faster pace than in the past. In 2011, the last time that Boeing was behind Airbus in plane deliveries, Boeing's deliveries stood at 477, Airbus at 536.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Boeing has continued to build the 737 Max, though at a reduced rate. Boeing will probably have about 400 of the jets completed but undelivered by the end of the year. The huge supply of completed 737 Max jets at the end of this year likely will allow Boeing to move back into the lead in deliveries in 2020.

Note the bullish engulfing candle that we saw on both Thursday, along with above average volume. 

Although the DJT has underperformed the market as a whole over the past year, it appears to have made another higher low on the one month chart and could very well reach for a higher high as the broader market continues to rally.

The case for FedEX here is even stronger I believe. It’s established a clear bottom in the 155 range since December, and last month saw a sell off going into earnings, followed by a pop afterwards. As a stock with all headwinds fully priced in, it would appear as though the outlook wasn’t quite as bad as feared. Sellers did come in following the post ER rally, but the volume was lower and they were unable to breach the 160 level. This could indicate that sellers of the stock are exhausted. Then on Wednesday, Goldman added FedEX to its conviction buy list, helping it to rally .8% on higher volume even as the DJT fell .8%. And again on Thursday, FedEx former a bullish engulfing candle on higher volume just as the DJT did, but it also outperformed the index by about .75%.

So that’s my thesis. I’d have to say the setup looks quite strong for both, and I’m hoping to see the DJT make a higher high and FedEx break above the 170 level through the end of next week.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,376426,public,self,"FedEX, DJT",0,1563005664,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cc82e4/fedex_djt/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Reasons why I dislike commodity equities:**

* Not only do you need to know your company, you also need to be fully across macro economics and socio-political factors - this will mean you’ll be at a significant disadvantage if you’re not an industry insider;
* Oil &amp; Gas reserves are based on technical reports and analysis by “competent persons” - nobody can ever be 100% sure how much Oil &amp; Gas is underneath the ground, hence the inherent nature of these equities are higher risk;

**What are reserves?**

There are 3 types of reserves:

* Proven - 90% of commercial feasibility to extract
* Probable - 50% of commercial feasibility to extract
* Possible (inferred/indicated) - 10% feasibility to extract

As mentioned above, this is measured by “competent persons” and is their best educated guess, based on various techniques and methods - it’s uneconomical to dig up an entire patch of ground or a seabed to make 100% certain, hence there is always room for human error.

There are also “resources”, which happens to be measured by the same group of “competent persons” - these are not classified as reserves because they’re less confident about these, hence why they’re classed as “resources” - all of this seems highly anecdotal to me, which is why as an average retail investor, I think it’s safer to discount the potential value of these “resources” (unless you’re well versed in reading 150+ page technical reports, drilling, fracking, engineering, geology, etc.)...

**What are SRCI’s reserves worth?**

Based on the tables below, I've used SRCI's proven reserves as per their FY 18 report. As you can see on fig 2, they have 88mm Bbl's of oil, 771.9 bn c/f of gas, and 89.1mm Bbl's of NGLs (proven).

On fig 1, I've plotted their operating and net margins - these are inclusive of cash costs, and all expenses such as royalties, sustaining CAPEX, OPEX, project CAPEX, and even derivative gains or losses (because commodity companies sell into the spot market, but they always have a portion of their book hedged).

What's important to pay attention to is that they will always achieve a sales price less than the spot price, for this very reason. Therefore, it's also important to discount the net value of SCRI's reserves by the average percentage difference in realized vs. spot price, in addition to a 10 - 15% margin of safety discount one would normally apply.

[Google sheets with calculations, margins, spot vs. realized prices, and etc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GuzCqTKT88LtRh_ZXapsr699y52PBToDfikALzaCqe4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Other factors to consider:**

* The next oil bear and bull market - how long these will last for;
* What are the geo-political uncertainties e.g.: Libya, Iran, overproduction, undersupply, manipulation by OPEC, etc.;
* How American Oil &amp; Gas companies can remain competitive, if they need to ship their exports across an entire ocean vs. Gazprom being able to deliver it directly via it’s pipeline network

**If you prefer a video analysis, please feel free to visit my Reddit profile for a link to my YouTube page.**

In summation, I believe SRC Energy is trading at or slightly above fair value, when comparing their Enterprise Value to net value of reserves (at the average price). If we see another oil bear market, then SRC Energy will become loss-making (like back in 2015-2016), therefore there is not enough of a margin of safety to consider this stock just now.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,376373,public,self,SRCI - SRC Energy - Valuing An Oil &amp; Gas Company,0,1562991131,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cc5zjd/srci_src_energy_valuing_an_oil_gas_company/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks in advance for any feedback - 

US 10th July -

The US stock market closed today after a productive session. Nasdaq [TICKER] closed yesterday at 7826.86 and increased by 0.97%, an increase of 76.54, ending the session at 7903.40. S&amp;P 500 [TICKER] also finished on a high at 2993.07, climbing 0.45%. The DOW Industrial Average [TICKER] closed yesterday on 26783.49 and followed this trend, gaining 76.71(0.29%) finishing on 26860.20

Both Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500’s record highs were surpassed again today, with intraday peaks suggesting even more room for growth. 

Positive trading attitudes have been driven mostly by Jay Powell’s full endorsement of the July rate cut. Traders can most likely expect The Central Bank to reduce its main policy rate by 0.25 percentage points in the coming weeks. 

Volume, however, has remained on the low side, especially on the S&amp;P 500, despite rising slightly over the last three days. 

Nasdaq's volume was lower than usual, with a 3% deviation from its three month average. The DOW Industrial Average had a volume of 207.99 million, 25% lower than average, and S&amp;P 500's volume was 52% lower than its three month average, at 1.64 billion.

This low volume suggests sustained caution amongst skeptics of the July rate cut, as well as uncertainty around ongoing US-China trade talks, after the unproductive G20 meet in late June.  

Energy, telecommunications and technology stocks have been driving positive performance across the board.  

The top gainers on the DOW were Chevron [ticker] and Pfizer [ticker], climbing 1.69% and 1.59% respectively. S&amp;P 500 highest gainers were Western Digital [ticker] and Align Technology [ticker] at 4.97% and 4.08%, while Nasdaq's top performers were also Western Digital [ticker], at 4.97%, and T-Mobile US [ticker], at 4.63%.

Tesla too has seen good performance consistently since Tuesday, with prices surging at the start of trading on Wednesday after they announced plans to boost production capacity. 

3M [ticker] and Verizon [ticker] were the DOW's lowest performers today, with a percentage fall of -0.87% and -1.23%. The S&amp;P 500’s biggest losers were Unum Group [ticker] and Hanesbrands [ticker] at -4.86% and -4.89%. Finally, Nasdaq's biggest losers were Wynn Resorts [ticker] and QUALCOMM [ticker], with changes of -2.53% and -2.86%.

Hanesbrands poor performance in July comes as a surprise after a huge 16% boost June. Projected long term growth may be less certain now for Hanesbrands as investors liquidate their shares in favor of better performing sectors.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,376280,public,self,"I've been working on semi-automated market update news articles, and I'm looking for someone to tell me what's shit about them.",0,1562973459,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cc2wy1/ive_been_working_on_semiautomated_market_update/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anyways I’ve been trying aggressively to learn day trading if nothing else but to pick a symbol for the day, buy in, and then take my profits out. Risk management I suppose. 

I’ve done pretty well but I’m always cutting it short and realizing I’d be making more just leaving my money in. I’ve turned a 10% profit in the last 3 months doing this. Going long last winter, I pulled off about double that. But I don’t like the loss of control...doing the same moves in the last 3 months going long I would’ve lost money.

I've been watching it for over a year, and almost bought in when Berkshire Hathoway took a stake in the company last year (sounds like they currently hold 43 million shares).

The company has been in trouble for years,  and cut their dividend in 2017 to try and help with a massive restructing of the company.  When Berkshire bought in in 2018, the stock was trading at around 18 a share, and its biggest risk was its large debt and expiring patents.   

Since then, as we've all seen in the news, it's at the center of the opioid crisis and facing lawsuits from dozens of states, which tanked its share price from 20 to under 8.  

It is risky, but Orrwitz saw it as a potential value stock at 18.  If it can survive the opioid lawsuits, which should be a temporary hit, wouldn't it reason that the stock should be able to eventually reinstate their dividend,  which should help regrow its share price back to what it was last year?  It feels like what the tobacco companies went through in the 90s.  Short term pain, then back to profitability for the ones that survived.  The liability of the lawsuits is factored into it's new low price, and if/when it can get past that, and restricting, then all it really has to battle is debt, which again berkshire saw as very doable.  

There is also some small fear of the political risks with the various healthcare plans being promoted by various presidential candidates, but seeing at how difficult it was to even pass Obamacare several years ago, this doesnt feel like a substantial risk to Teva, at least not for the next several years.

With the markets being at all time highs, and everyone waiting for a recession, does teva seem like a potentially good place to park some money?

Considerations:

\-Given the genesis of US space-faring, almost all US companies involved in space travel have extensive operations in defense or weapons manufacturing. This presents certain ethical questions that an investor must consider.

\-Space travel is not profitable. Nearly all profits generated by these companies for their efforts in space came directly from government contracts. There are at present very few profit-motivations in outer space. An investor should be aware that the companies above act very differently from the widget manufacturers of Economics 101.

\-The allocation weightings above are based on my own inferences. I considered each company's market cap, as well as the proportion of space-related revenues to all revenues, but ultimately the allocations above are totally made up.

Considerations:

\-Given the genesis of US space-faring, almost all US companies involved in space travel have extensive operations in defense or weapons manufacturing. This presents certain ethical questions that an investor must consider.

\-Space travel is not profitable. Nearly all profits generated by these companies for their efforts in space came directly from government contracts. There are at present very few profit-motivations in outer space. An investor should be aware that the companies above act very differently from the widget manufacturers of Economics 101.

\-The allocation weightings above are based on my own inferences. I considered each company's market cap, as well as the proportion of space-related revenues to all revenues, but ultimately the allocations above are totally made up.

I've done a fair bit of research but I am no expert and would love an insight into what my portfolio allocation would potentially look like. All of my picks are Canadian companies, and after my initial $6k contribution I'll be looking to add some broad market ETFs in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

Enbridge ([ENB.TO](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ENB.TO?p=ENB.TO)) $2,000 (33.33%) - Currently floating at $48 CAD, ENB can easily break to $55 in the near future and offers a lucrative dividend of 6%. Of course it's an energy company and it's price will fluctuate with the prices of oil and results of certain pipelines. I'm very confident in this pick as I believe in the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dividend 15 Split Corp ([DFN.TO](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DFN.TO?p=DFN.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) $1,000 (16.67%) - Purely interested in the 13.7% dividend that's been paid out for 183 straight months. The price fluctuates with the broad market so I'd definitely see myself buying more of this on any sort of market dip. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aurora Cannabis ([ACB.TO](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACB.TO?p=ACB.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) $1,000 (16.67%) - Risky investment in cannabis, but I am a firm believer that one day ACB will one of the top cannabis companies worldwide. With the largest production capacity out of any producers, ACB holds an edge over competition. I'm just waiting on them to announce some sort of partnership with another large company to put them on par with other cannabis producing companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rogers Sugar Inc ([RSI.TO](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/RSI.TO?p=RSI.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) $600 (10%) - Despite that people claim they consume less sugar nowadays, numbers don't lie. What got my eye onto this stock was the high dividend. Rogers is a deeply rooted Canadian company that's been producing sugar for over 100 years, and as long as their Q2 earnings isn't abysmal, I see myself allocating a section of my portfolio for this company. 

&amp;#x200B;

CIBC ([CM.TO](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CM.TO?p=CM.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) $1,400 (23.33%) - CIBC is a big 5 bank in Canada and just so happens to be my bank. CM.TO looks beaten and undervalued. I believe with proper moves and proper use of money, CIBC has plenty of room for growth. I'm also not worried if the market does crash, as \~24% of my portfolio is in a defensive bank stock. Not to mention it offers me an appealing 5% dividend. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, I'm leaning towards a dividend TFSA. With a cannabis stock in there for some risk. Is there anything I'm missing, am I being naive to something really obvious? I think I'd be happy with the potential returns of this portfolio is regards to the risk. Once 2020 rolls around and I add more contribution room I'll look to add some broad market ETFs such as SPY, QQQ, and VGRO.

The reasons that I got in it to begin with don't exist any more, but it has a nice dividend and was making me some decent money for awhile which is why I held it for so long. It has since lost all gains, so that money has done absolutely no work for me in 5 years..

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear what you would do with any or all of the positions below: 

MMM - Got in bad at $213. Trade war hit them hard. Can they maintain profit margin and sales in the long-term? 

BA - Got in at $370 - Thought it's a good play on the dip. What if this permanently damages reputation. not possible right? 

NVDA - Got in at 20 - they have been steadily falling since the peak of  bitcoin, which is seeing a resurgence. Without cryptocurrency I think it falls further - I think it's a sell, but maybe long long term they are good? 

FDX - Got in bad at  $188. More things are going to be sold online, things that need to be delivered. Amazon is taking over a lot of deliveries especially last mile. Is there a better pick or should i avoid this industry?

STNE - Got in at $33.85.. I kind of want to liquidate at a small loss to get in something similar but more established like V, MA, or AXP. Anyone know anything about this 

AMD - I love AMD, got in at $11.25. I know they are doing a great job of competing with NVDA and Intel recently, but their P/E is \~100. I have a hard time justifying such a high P/E, compared to Intels P/E of 10 and NVDA of 30, however, they have such a small share of the revenue and market cap in this space. How fast can they take market share if they continue to produce quality GPUs and CPUs.

Amazon Prime members can receive some package in one day instead of two, and a broader rollout is on the way.

That’s good news for Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN), but not for the U.S. Postal Service, one analyst says. “We expect Amazon’s move to Prime 1-day delivery will drive higher conversion rates, leading to accelerating unit growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020,” wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a note on Monday.

He expects Amazon to be one of a number of third-party distributors that will continue to take a significant share of the U.S. market for “last mile” deliveries, those that bring a package to its final destination, typically someone’s residence.

Amazon’s additional market share—and gains in merchandise sales and revenue—will come largely at the expense of the U.S. Postal Service, Blackledge said.

Growth in the volume of parcels delivered by the post office dropped from 21% in 2016 to 6% in 2018. There was a 5% year-over-year decline in the first quarter of 2019, according to post-office figures the analyst cited.

The decline comes as Amazon ramps up some of its faster shipping programs and shifts to other options for last-mile deliveries. Blackledge estimates that the share of Amazon’s last-mile deliveries handled by the postal service will drop from about 54% in 2018 to about 35% in 2024. His previous estimate was for a share of 45% in 2024.

The postal service didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other players, such as DHL International, and Amazon affiliates including its Uber-like in-house program Amazon Flex, and its Delivery Service Partner program, are picking up that market share.

Cowen estimates that these other distributors combined will account for 23% of Amazon’s delivery volume in 2019. The total will rise to 43% by 2024, Cowen predicted.

Blackledge maintained a Outperform rating on the stock and a price target of $2,500.

Amazon stock was up 0.8% to $1968 on Tuesday morning.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

For those unfamiliar with these two indexes here is a brief summary (From Yahoo Finance)

&amp;#x200B;

**Descriptions**

**SPY**: "" The investment seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by holding a portfolio of the common stocks that are included in the index, with the weight of each stock in the Portfolio substantially corresponding to the weight of such stock in the index.""

**VTS**: "" The investment seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of the overall U.S. stock market. The CRSP US Total Market Index, represents approximately 100%of the investable U.S. stock market and includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. ""

&amp;#x200B;

**Yield**

**SPY**: 1.85%  
**VTS**: 1.84%

&amp;#x200B;

**Expense Ratios**

**SPY**: 0.09%  
**VTS**: 0.05%

&amp;#x200B;

**Musings**

Looking at these two index's, the fundamental difference seems to be that SPY tracks the 500 companies with the largest market capital (US) while VTS tracks a representation of the entire market (US). VTS's expense ratio is 55.55% of SPY's, however the difference is 0.04% which doesn't seem much. 

The benefit of VTS seems to be that the smaller cap stocks have more room to grow in the market which I imagine in good times will produce greater returns. On the other hand, these companies may not have the stability to survive during bad times leading to them dying off and producing a lower return. I believe this will make VTS more volatile.

My plan right is now to take X amount of every paycheck I get and simply add it to my portfolio by buying the exact same index as before. My initial plan was to pick the X3 S&amp;P and Nasdaq (SPXL and TQQQ) and just buy extra stocks every months. It sounds like it has the benefit of earning decently, while not adding thousands of dollars every months.

My main concern is that I can be seriously mistaken and that plan is actually terrible. I understand that nothing is certain, but there are risks that are unnecessary to take with long term investments, so I am trying to avoid them.

My research has me feeling really good about BMY. So much so that I've bought 20 shares at $45.70 each for a total of $914 invested. Now, I know this may not sound like much to a lot of you, but it is a substantial investment for me. 

I do not plan to sell for at least 1 year from now, partly because of taxes. The reason I'm feeling good about BMY long-term is its past health, future growth potential, P/E Ratio, RSI, I've seen it pop up as a ""buy"" from analysts all across the Internet, and finally it appears to be at a great price currently. Trading near its lowest price in 5 years. 

However, I'm new to investing and this is still terrifying! Could I survive if the company suddenly went bankrupt and I lost everything? Sure, but this is still a healthy chunk of my current savings.

Its easy to use website building tools allow users to easily create a professional looking website with little to no experience.


But why are website builders like Wix.com becoming such a popular choice even among expert website developers?


For beginners, Wix Editor is an easy to use tool that allows you to design your website exactly how you want it using drag and drop tools. There's also Wix ADI which is an artificial intelligence that designs the site for you based on knowledge it gathers of what you like.


For developers, Wix offers a product called Wix Code which gives you full control over your website's functionality with Javascript and Wix Code APIs.


**Important Terms**

Registered User: Created an account, for free

User Cohort: Aggregation of users added in given time period

Premium Subscription: A package purchased by a user; a single user can purchase more than one subscription


**Cohorts**

Cohorts are referred to as a subset of users, categorized by acquisition date. It allows companies to analyze important subscriber metrics like churn, which is when a subscriber ends their paid subscription with a company.

**TROI (Time to Return On (Marketing) Investment)**

TROI can be found by this formula: Revenue gained per Subscriber / Cost to acquire each Subscriber

**How does TROI tie into Cohorts?**

Say your first month of business you gain 100 registered users with 10 of these users paying for a premium subscription. Next month you gain 200 more registered users with 20 of these users paying for premium as well as 10 more of the users from last month converting to premium. Each month your goal is to:

1. Get more users to register
2. Get existing ones to convert to premium
3. And reduce churn


Now say you invest $100 in marketing and in return gain $10 in revenue from subscribers. Overtime your revenue from subscribers will continue to increase as more people continue to pay their subscription or convert to premium. So that initial marketing investment will continuously increase revenue overtime.


So cohorts are important because they are a driving source of future revenue growth. You want last month's registered users to convert to premium and premium users to continue paying for their subscription.


**Wix Subscriber Growth**

- The company’s registered users increased to 142 million as on Dec 31, 2018, up 19% year over year.

- Total subscriptions were 4 million, up 24% year over year.

- Existing cohorts expected to generate future collections of $4.3 Billion

- Every new 100K Net Subscriptions = $165 Million in Collections over 8 years at an 80% Gross Margin

- TROI remained stable over the last 3 years while marketing investment and collections grew 2.3x


**What makes Wix stand out**


**New Products:** Improving and creating new products like Wix Ascend and Turbo create opportunity to expand their user base and convert users to premium subscriptions.

**Global Penetration:** Continued penetration into the company’s geographic area of operations will drive revenue growth into the future. 

**Brand:** Wix.com is the strongest brand in the industry with over 4 million average monthly searches from Jan-Mar 2018

**Partnerships:** Partnerships with the NY Yankees and Manchester City FC are a great way to reach new audiences in an engaging way

**Acquisitions:** DeviantArt, the largest online art gallery and community, was acquired by Wix in February of 2017

**E-Commerce:** Massive growth in e-commerce and transition to mobile sales will give Wix significant long term opportunities with global e-commerce expecting $5T by 2021, according to eMarketer",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,374963,public,self,Wix.com (WIX) Analysis: Future Growth Potential and Understanding Their Business Model,0,1562696059,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/caoo24/wixcom_wix_analysis_future_growth_potential_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent drop off presents a great long-term buying opportunity for investors. At Home currently operates 178 retail locations and has plans to expand to a total of 600 retail locations. They are averaging around 25 new locations per year in densely populated areas. Management believes they can grow the store base at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15% to 20% for the foreseeable future. They are cash flow positive and the recent slowdown is more than likely only temporary. When they reach their full 600 locations, net income could be around $100m. They're the leading low-cost provider in home decor.

""Our store growth is supported by new store economics that we believe are compelling. Our new stores generate an average of approximately $7 million of net sales within the first full year of operations and reach maturity within the first six months. On average, our new store sites which are leased or purchased require approximately $3 million to $4  million of net investment and our new build stores require approximately $2 million to $3 million of net investment  (net of sale leaseback proceeds).

please could you guys help me out?

I live in Slovakia (small country in Europe) and in my lifetime I made some money that I really wanted to invest. So, I found myself some wealth management companies in my country which promised to take care of my money and invest it. But as you can imagine it always ended the same way: they invested my money into stocks where the portfolio is nothing else but a copy of some big ETFs and they keep charging me big monthly! fees. They aren’t trading with the money, nothing. The money just sits in the same stocks for over a year now and they just keep charging me fees. So, I got sick of it and decided that I want to withdraw the money from them and invest it myself into stocks and hold these stocks for a long time. In the end it will be the same as they are doing but without the huge monthly fees.

   
 

But there is a small problem. I am a bit of a noob in stock trading. I have some experience in forex trading and cryptocurrency but I never traded stocks. So, I would really appreciate if you guys could help me out. 

   
 

My goal is to buy some stocks and hold them for years to come.

The questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I want to buy stocks, do I do it through an online broker?
2. Does it matter which online broker I use if I won’t be an active trader and it will mostly be a onetime trade for a long time?  (I would be really happy if you pro guys could recommend me some good brokers)
3. How are the dividends paid if I buy the stocks through an online broker? They are just paid straight to my investor      account?
4. Any other good tips fellow pro traders?

   
 

Thank you guys very much for your time and sorry for my bad English (I am not a native English speaker).

I hope you have had a great, safe weekend.

I have been trying to enter the emerging markets portion of my portfolio, and I have seen a recent increase of chatter on African investments. The latest has begun the reduction of trade tariffs between many of the African countries.

I believe with the African landscape being open to intercountry trading, a vast supply of resources, and some introduction of foreign powers into the area to stabilize the regions, I am seeing Africa as an entry level investment possibility to some good growth in the long term (5+ years). 

For my question, I am seeing if there are any ETFs, mutual funds, or any other investments that look interesting to this topic. I am excited to hear about other avenues I am not seeing.

Thank you,

ABucketfull

Chickens are one of the least fiscally intensive sources of food you can raise. Chickens require extremely minimal amounts of feed and water to raise as opposed to beef, pig, or seafood, and we can grow a chicken to its full size in an average of 60 days, can get it down to 40 days with growth hormones. Things like lettuce, corn, soybean, and nuts require much more water and do not contain nearly as much protein. Protein and vitamins and minerals would be much more necessary as opposed to carbohydrates if we started to have to choose which sort of food source would be absolutely necessary in a famine. Chickens also lay eggs as they are on their way to slaughter, making them the most efficient farm animal through the interim of their life. Tyson has stockpiled years worth of grain, corn and different feed inventories to help combat raising corn prices we have seen due to the multi-week flooding in the midwest(leading to less farmers harvesting corn thereby reducing supply). Basically so they are more resistant to having to spend money on the input cost of their animal farming. So even if corn and hay production stopped, Tyson has their own inventories of feed to continue their own production lines for several years. They sell 40-45 Billion dollars of food a year and are sitting on a ton of cash and assets and would be able to weather the challenges of a famine much better than smaller animal agriculture companies like Sanderson Farms, Hormel, and Kraft.

Advantages:

1. They have made 6 huge strategic moves in the last two quarters and are alligning all their resources into the China market which is where demand for infant formula is extremely high. They are only just starting to tap into the overseas market and still had 80% of their revenue coming in from domestic sales last quarter, think about all that uncapped potential that is about to grow the stock in a big way with the redirection into China.
2. They have created their own niche in the infant formula sector with the first organic grass fed formula and also by using goat milk formula which is seeing good growth. This helps combat the obvious dominance of company giants like A2 Milk and Bellamys in the same space.
3. The stock is very sensitive to announcements and has died down since topping off at $1.50 around the time of the announcement last quarter. I think that the Q4 quarterly activities report coming out at the end of July will make the price soar with the huge growth from this last quarter due to the increased demand channels. The end of year report could also boost the stock higher which is announced a month later but less so due to the numbers already having been released for each quarter at that point.
4. Apart from the short term, I think this company has carved out a pathway for exponential growth in the coming years and will see excellent growth long term especially with the huge demand from China.

Disadvantages:

1. A few insiders did sell off considerable amounts of stocks in May when the stock reached new highs such as the founder Kristy Carr who sold 4000000 shares although she did state that she was buying a new home with the money and the stock was up over 200% in 2019 at that point so it is understandable to want to sell off some shares.
2. Talks of tighter regulations on the importation of goods into China. This could be a huge blow for the company especially as it is still in its infancy and a lot of its increasing price is the result of speculation into the effect of China's demand on its future revenue and profits.
3. Since Bubs is still a young company, it is quite unpredictable and there is a lack of financial fundamentals and customer base meaning that the future is uncertain and caution should be used when investing in thhis stock.

# **The week ahead: Powell’s testimony could make or break the stock rally  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/05/the-week-ahead-powells-testimony-could-make-or-break-the-stock-rally.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to reinforce market expectations for a late July rate cut or rein them in when he speaks to Congress in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday and at the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, and is expected to answer questions on the economy and Fed policy.
*****
&gt; His testimony comes after a strong June jobs report raised questions about whether the Fed will actually cut rates this month. The U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs last month, easily topping a Dow Jones estimate of 165,000. The report sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield back above the key 2% level. The dollar also rallied against a basket of currencies, pressuring commodities like gold.
*****
&gt; The report was “stronger than expected, but with an accompanying -11k in revisions the job gains were nothing to derail the Fed’s anticipated cut in 26 days,” Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note. The Fed next decides on rates on July 31.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the market also has other places to look for clues on Fed policy, including in the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting, after which it suggested it could cut rates if it needs to. Those minutes are released Wednesday afternoon. There is also important consumer price index inflation data Thursday and producer level inflation data on Friday, when PPI is reported.
*****
&gt; But Powell’s comments to Congressional committees could clarify whether the Fed is on course to cut interest rates later this month, as widely expected.
*****
&gt; “It’s not clear to me the data are going to create a screaming case one way or the other. What it comes down to, is the Fed able to validate the market’s dovishness here?” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. “The one thing that has characterized Fed communications over the last month or six weeks is they’re just not willing to commit to anything ahead of time.”
*****
&gt; Hopes for a rate cut have sent bond yields lower and supported stocks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs. The tech sector rose more than 1% to a record as well, while the communications services sector surged more than 2%.
*****
&gt; Economists say the markets would see a violent swing if Powell doesn’t stay on track for a rate cut. The fed funds futures market is pricing in one full quarter point rate cut and a little more for July.
*****
&gt; “I personally don’t see the case for an ease right now,” said Stanley. “Do they passively accept the market’s verdict or do they push back, in that they’re not fully on board with an ease right now? It would be easy to realign the market’s expectations. Powell speaks next week and that would be the perfect opportunity if they were so inclined.”
*****
&gt; Stanley said such a move would upset the stock market and weaken financial conditions, something the Fed would not want to do. But there is not a unanimous view about interest rate moves on the Fed either. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said this week that rates should be kept where they are for awhile. On the other hand, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented at the June meeting because the Fed did not cut interest rates.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said a change in tone from Powell would be disruptive and unlikely. “There are other people trying to figure out what is the right thing to do right now, and there’s no easy answer,” said Swonk. “Jay Powell has made up his mind, and he doesn’t want to be on the wrong side of a recession.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter point at the end of the month. “All you need is uncertainty. You’ve got that. You need inflation running low. You got that. You need wages not accelerating rapidly. You’ve got that,” she said. “You’ve got all these things lining up.”
*****
&gt; Some economists expect a half point cut, but Swonk said that would be too much since the Fed does not really have a lot of ammunition, given that the fed funds rate range is 2.25 to 2.50%. “They want insurance, but they don’t want to give away the house,” she said.
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, investors will begin to think second quarter earnings season in the week ahead. Pepsico is a big name releasing its report Tuesday, ahead of the flood of reports from banks and others in the following week.

# Jumbo First Half Gains Usually Continue After a Pause

&gt; The market just put on its best first half performance for the Dow since 1999, the S&amp;P 500 since 1997 and NASDAQ since 2003 – and that’s a pretty decent omen that market will tack on additional gains. Performance below following first-half Dow and S&amp;P 500 gains greater than 7% and NASDAQ Composite gains greater than 10% shows a solid history of gains for the second half – after a tepid market action in Q3.

&gt; Modest gains of about 1% continue into July, but gains little ground during the rest of Q3, which should come as no surprise given the infamous negative history of August and September. On average the market was unable to match first half gains during the second, though the across-the-board 7+% gains over from July to December is still solid. The Dow’s second half win ratio following jumbo gains like 2019 is a rather impressive 85.3% – S&amp;P’s win ration is 80.0%, NAS 73.9%. Full-year gains are virtual lock.

# S&amp;P 500 Sector Weightings: Mid-Year 2019

&gt; Below is an updated snapshot of S&amp;P 500 sector weightings as of mid-year 2019. As shown, the Technology sector makes up the largest slice of the pie with a weighting of 21.48%. Health Care ranks as the second largest sector of the market at 14.20%, followed by Financials at 13.07%. The fact that technology and two service-oriented sectors making up nearly 50% of the index shows how much the US economy has shifted over the years. After the ""big three"" of Tech, Health Care, and Financials, we move down to Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Industrials, which are all right around 10%. Consumer Staples has a weighting of 7.27%, and Energy is all the way down to 5.05% after years of losing share. Utilities, Real Estate, and Materials combine to add up to roughly 9% of the index, so these three sectors are basically immaterial at this point.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weightings.png))**

&gt; Below is a chart showing how much weightings changed in the first half of 2019. The Technology sector gained 1.33 percentage points while Health Care lost 1.23 percentage points, so the gap between the biggest sector (Tech) and the 2nd biggest sector (Health Care) widened by more than 2.5. Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Real Estate, Materials, and Communication Services all gained share in the first half as well, while Energy, Financials, Consumer Staples, and Utilities all lost share along with Health Care.

# Most Heavily Shorted S&amp;P 500 Stocks

&gt; Below is a list of the 29 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have more than 10% of their share float sold short. Luxury retailer Nordstrom (JWN) currently tops the list with 22% of its float sold short. The stock is down 33.86% YTD and 55% from levels seen last November.

&gt; Tax-prep company H&amp;R Block (HRB) is the second most heavily shorted stock with 20.55% of its float sold short. HRB is followed by sports retailer Under Armour (UAA), Snap-On (SNA), and Kohl's (KSS). While JWN and KSS are both down big YTD, HRB, UAA, and SNA are all up nicely on the year.

&gt; There are plenty of other notables on the list, including Macy's (M), Campbell Soup (CPB), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Gap (GPS), Western Union (WU), and Foot Locker (FL), but one common characteristic among many of them is that they are retailers.

&gt; On average, these stocks with 10%+ short interest as a percentage of float are up 8.5% on the year, which is well below the 17% gain that the S&amp;P 500 has seen.

# Yield Curve Craters

&gt; With the 10-year plummeting below 2% again and the 3-month yield spiking up by over 7 basis points (bps), which is its biggest one day gain since December 2017, the yield curve is cratering today. Today's 11 bps move further into inverted territory is the biggest one-day move since January 2nd (see second chart). While not back at new lows, today marks the 29th day that the curve has now been inverted. In Fedspeak news, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester (who leans hawkish but isn't a voter) just noted in a speech that she's in no hurry to cut. She argues that ""Cutting rates at this juncture could reinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and could encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be counterproductive.""

&gt; What would cause her to change her stance? “If I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing activity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of longer-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the weak-growth scenario.” A few weak job reports? In other words, she is in no hurry to take any action. Keep in mind, though, that as recently as late February, Mester was still of the view that the FOMC would need to be raising rates later on this year.

# Happy Birthday, And Another Record Goes Down

&gt; “If you’re looking for something to discuss at your barbecue while watching fireworks, be sure to mention this is now the oldest economic cycle in history at 121 months old,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. That’s right, this cycle just topped the previous record of 120 months from the 1990s technology boom.

&gt; Although 10 years might sound old, keep in mind that developed markets tend to have longer cycles of economic growth. “Is 10 years really that old for an expansion? Maybe not, as Australia hasn’t had a recession for nearly 28 years,” according to Detrick. “Not to mention Canada, the U.K., Spain, and Sweden, which all have had at least 15 years of growth starting in the early 1990s and ending in 2008. Going even further back we see that France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Ireland, and China have all had at least 15-year-plus expansions since World War II.”

&gt; Emerging countries tend to see more of a boom-and-bust type of cycle while more developed nations can have longer-lasting periods of growth. In fact, it’s plausible that the United States could have avoided a recession in 2001 if the 9/11 attacks had not happened, which would have produced a nearly 17-year expansion. So maybe 10 years isn’t so old?

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, This Is Now The Longest Expansion Ever, shows, this is now the longest expansion ever. Additionally, over the decades as the United States turned into a developed nation, the cycles of growth tended to last longer. Thanks to the dual benefits of fiscal and monetary policy, we continue to expect this current cycle to have potentially years of growth left.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos' divorce from his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, was finalized by a Seattle-area judge on Friday, paving the way for her to receive $38.3 billion worth of Amazon stock, Bloomberg reported.

In April, Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, said in a filing that 4% of its outstanding stock or 19.7 million shares would be registered in MacKenzie Bezos' name after court approval of the divorce.

The couple announced their plan to divorce in a joint Twitter statement in January, causing some to worry that Jeff Bezos could wind up with reduced Amazon voting power or that he or MacKenzie would liquidate large position.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,374202,public,self,Amazon founder Bezos' divorce final with $38 billion settlement: report,0,1562505560,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c9tigz/amazon_founder_bezos_divorce_final_with_38/,all_ads,6,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '0fvgQPY5esicnVsaGWPPz_3v6fEmDS_4ABtSnGy9aBY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 77, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mkxy-DwnFpUVSwZYdZOkRcYOJU_eL8d6apRsXsLy6wc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b655165202a31b17295ae0bb7625ffbb8a514cc', 'width': 108}, {'height': 155, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mkxy-DwnFpUVSwZYdZOkRcYOJU_eL8d6apRsXsLy6wc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93720385c452624cef038de706838ab587cf288', 'width': 216}, {'height': 230, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mkxy-DwnFpUVSwZYdZOkRcYOJU_eL8d6apRsXsLy6wc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3b0720eef8722a4bbeb3c39821a3c9e722fb1fb', 'width': 320}, {'height': 461, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mkxy-DwnFpUVSwZYdZOkRcYOJU_eL8d6apRsXsLy6wc.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff3dca76409f7cd829c164d4319350f9ac7d8a10', 'width': 640}, {'height': 692, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mkxy-DwnFpUVSwZYdZOkRcYOJU_eL8d6apRsXsLy6wc.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6c2535ae29649782f78b35027381da003cd7dc8', 'width': 960}, {'height': 778, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mkxy-DwnFpUVSwZYdZOkRcYOJU_eL8d6apRsXsLy6wc.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0cb96576aa8ea74c7996147af47c947728c5ef8', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 865, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mkxy-DwnFpUVSwZYdZOkRcYOJU_eL8d6apRsXsLy6wc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c7fbfc99d4f512ad184cb82692a3438286cc9fbd', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

The timing of the purchase is interesting as

1. The company is due to report earnings on July 22nd 
2. The purchase comes after a year of stock price declines from $7.55 that has put the company’s valuation at $405 million compared to a book value of $858 million
3. (and most importantly) the company owns 54.1 million shares in Scorpio Tankers that have increased by 55% to $164 million (compared to $107 million in Q1 reports)

Thats a $57 million boost that should feed into the Q2 report in a couple of weeks.  A meaningful amount for a $405 million company that should get noticed. (Please note this is a speculative small cap stock)

Entercom merged with CBS Radio in 2017 to become the second biggest radio company in the US (after iHeartMedia Inc). Since then the company has disposed of $100 million non radio assets and should realize about $45 million of merger related synergies this year. On Tuesday Barron’s reported a 200,000 acquisition of shares by its chairman Joe Field along with the memorable quote that  “I am buying the stock because it is deeply undervalued and does not reflect the company’s strong and growing free cash flow and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, its 6% dividend yield or its strong competitive position and growth opportunities"" 

Mr Field has always been a big fan of his company, a sentiment that is not shared by the market in general given the stock price is down 23% this year, but sports betting and the Presidential election should provide a boost to revenues over the next couple of years and at current levels the stock looks cheap.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for all investors. Small cap stocks have elevated risks.

This is my first post on Reddit actually. Recently started saving up some money due to finally getting into a salary job. Invested in my first 3 stocks this week. A few questions:


1. Favorite (preferably free) websites (or apps) for buy/sell analysis? Currently, stockinvest.us, Zacks, and NASDAQ's website. Honestly, just looking for a site or sites that combine the most analysts buy/sell ratings. 


2. As of right now, only planning to invest a around $3000-$4000 per year. And most of that will be during a major market correction. I hadn't gotten into investing during the last one in December. I know these don't necessarily happen once per year even, but that's generally when I'm waiting to do most of my investing. I have some industries, stocks, and ETF's that I'm interested in and checking on the daily. Thoughts? 


3. Current stocks I'm invested in: 

5 shares of BMY at $45.74 per share. $228.70 total.

5 shares of USNA at $61.85 per share. $309.25 total.

12 shares of KLDO at $8.63 per share. $103.56 total. 

All were near their 52-week lows and I feel good about their potential based on my research. Would love any advice you all have about selling. I am young, willing to take higher risks, and happy to let stocks ride for longer if I believe long-term growth is there. 


Finally, so you don't think I'm only doing the high risk/high reward thing, I also plan to invest $6000 per year into a Roth IRA. 

Even if you just want to comment on one part of this post, it is greatly appreciated.

I know I've seen some people negative about the industry, but based on my research and talking to my financial advisor, I like the cannabis industry. I see a lot of growth and buyouts in the future as the US eventually legalizes it everywhere. Now, this would definitely be more long-term investing. I know there's some cannabis ETF's out there so what I've done is look into a few of the top ETF's in that industry and then picked out the specific stocks that are most heavily invested in across them to make my own, more concentrated cannabis portfolio. Higher risk since it is less diversified, but I like the idea. Would love to hear your thoughts. 

So for an example of creating my own semi-diversified cannabis portfolio, here is what I am thinking:

I take $1000 and invest this much into each of the following stocks (I would round up depending on stock prices)

$250 in CGC
$250 in ACB
$150 in CRON
$150 in TLRY
$100 in APHA
$100 in OGI 

These stocks, like most of the market, experienced decent dips this past December. Tilray being the line exception as it has continuously been on the decline these last few months. 

5. Finally, a look into a couple more stocks and some ETF's:

5 stocks that I currently have the most interest in (in addition to the 6 cannabis stocks mentioned above):

TTD 
CELG
NVDA
QCOM
BYND

ETF's that I currently have the most interest in:

IIPR (REIT)
YOLO
MJ
VNQ
VOO
SPY
VTI
VYM

As you can see, the cannabis industry still stands out. However, with that being said, most of these stocks (cannabis and otherwise) and ETF's experienced the same dip during the last market correction in late December. So other than a sharp drop to a specific stock, such was the case with BMY, USNA, and KLDO I will probably hold off on investing most of my money until that next major market correction. My plan as of now would be spend around $1500 on individual stocks and another $1500 on ETF's. 

I know this is an insanely long post so maybe I should break it down into smaller, more individualized posts, but I really would appreciate any advice you can offer!

Also, so you don't think I'm only doing the high risk/high reward thing, I also plan to invest $6000 per year into a Roth IRA. 

Even if you just want to comment on one part of this insanely long post, it is greatly appreciated.

Rather than looking into the hundreds/thousands of companies, you yearn for a shortcut.  


Enter:  Twitter.


Multiple Twitter users all claiming the same thing. TRIL will moon!  Buy $KOOL for an easy 50%.  AMRH/ARCI/ARCW have news coming, accumulate fast!   $SEEL way undervalued - a steal at this price!  Who are these dudes?  Who knows, their account names are pop culture alerts.   But their last tweet said they had HUGE gainzzzz.


You immediately put those stocks on your radar, and watch it jump.  It may immediately fly 10-15%!  So FOMO kicks in, and you make the jump.  After all, it’s going to move quick so get on it!   Just wait for that sweet ATH after close!   


“Great,” you think.  “I’ll wake up to that Lambo.”



The next morning, the alerts start at market bell.  $smallbioX down 40%.  70%.  You just got smacked.   But you’re not alone, right?  Those Twitter guys share your misery, right?   


No.  No, those Twitter guys are pumping and dumping on you and the other novice investors like you.  These aren’t charitable day traders out to make everyone rich - they’re out there to manufacture endless bagholders, looking for that sweet shortcut to wealth.  


That shortcut doesn’t exist.  If you’re putting your financial well-being on the line by following anonymous strangers with tv/movie character usernames- you’re setting yourself up for failure each and every time.   


Don’t.

Just received a job offer at an UK challenger bank and got offered one of the following 3 packs.

1. 22,7k per year  (£11 per hour) + 300 shares (£3900) 

2. 20,5k per year (£10 per hour) + 1000 shares (£13k)

3. 18,2k per year (£9 per hour) + 1690 shares (£22k)

I’ll be a final year student from September, have no mortgage to pay (😁), have no interest in buying glamorous stuff or throw my income into expensive hotels and probably my parents will help me with the accomodation costs (300£ out of 600£). Therefore, there won’t be much of a difference between 9£ or 11£ per hour to me, as I’ll still continue to be poor 😂 

I’m trying to decide between the second and the third option, however I’m open to any suggestion and piece of advice. I’m completely aware that shares could go down as things go wrong. 

I consider myself a risk-taking person and that’s why my main option at the moment would be the third one (plus that, who gets the medium menu at McD, we all know it’s a rip off, it’s either the small or the large one). However, I’m again aware that things might not work the same in this situation.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I'm thinking of buying some long call options on Nokia and activation.  I have never bought any options and these will be my first.

I plan to get both at the ATM strike price with expiry in Jan 2021.  I'm hoping on G5 movement on Nok as i think a lot more companies will be wary of huawei in case they are banned from doing business with US companies again.

As for activision im banking on the fact that their stock is low as they have no new titles out this year so their rev is down.  I hope they annouce or release something good before my option expires.  

If anyone has any input on these two please let me know.

Now i have some questions on buying options.

When buying the option you chose opening from the 'position' drop down.  I'm with investorline and it also has a closing choice which is weird to me as you are buying a call.

If you're ITM and want to take your gains do you sell the option to someone else or ""close it""?  I'm not sure anyone would buy the contract if your strike price is $5 and the current price is $10.  \

Can someone explain how closing an option works?  Does your broker exercise the option when you close it and immediately sell it and give you the profits?  If someone could explain that would be great!

I’m a relatively young investor and held a few shares of SBUX which I sold yesterday just before closing. It’s certainly not that I don’t like the company, but I see too much downside. They’re investing heavily in the Chinese market so any bad news between the US and China would mean bad news for SBUX. Additionally they are relatively pricey compared to McDonalds, Wawa, Dunkin’, etc. If a downturn is truly coming less people are going to be spending an extra few dollars a day on SBUX over Dunkin’. Lastly, their price has been increasing tremendously the last year. Yes they’re expanding into new markets, they are releasing a movie on Hulu, etc but I think any bad news with China and especially any downturn in the economy would crush any gains from the last year or two. I’d rather sell my shares in the green and buy back on a dip with the probability I’m probably going to be missing out on some gains in the coming months or even year, and then I have that cash ready for a downturn.

Since the last post, Mission Ready Solutions approximately $40 million in new contracts since Q2 - if they keep going at this rate, that's at least 160m a year in revenue! Their biggest contract was a $22.3m CDN that they received two weeks ago.

The company realized joint Unifire and Mission Ready Solutions statements on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) - you can take a look on how much assets, liabilities and revenues both companies have. Mind you that, most of 2018 was focused on closing the acqusition and they stopped bidding on contracts. June to September is the busy season for the DLA and they will hand out the majority of orders during this time. 

As for the $4 billion awarded in March, companies continue to bid on those contracts and they get awarded .

Let's say for example you have an index fund that costs $100 and it increases 10% over one year. That would leave you with $110 at the end of the year. That $10 dollars is then reinvested so then if the next year the fund grows %10 again you end up with $121.

How do I actually get that $10? Do I need to sell the index fund then buy it right back to reinvest? Because to my knowledge of the stock market you ideally buy low and sell high to get a profit and all the articles I have read just give examples if the market returns an average of X% then you will have $Y after a certain amount of years but I dont understand how to actually get the market returns to reinvest.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,373602,public,self,How to get market returns?,0,1562356905,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c92pk5/how_to_get_market_returns/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,
