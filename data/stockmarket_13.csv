I’ve recently created a stock scanner that is like a multi-dimensional visualization of the market.

You can get a feel of what it does from my twitter account : momo\_radar

I came up with this idea while I was doing Day Trade in the past few years whenever I was in-between jobs, learning from various traders on Youtube. Since then, I have been writing codes to scan for Trade Setups, because none of the other Stock Scanners currently available were what I was looking for. I never liked eye-balling at lists of texts and numbers, but pictures and patterns intrigue me.

Since I’ve done a fair bit of Day Trading myself, I’ve learnt to optimize the algorithms to ignore stocks that are not very tradable, while picking up trading signals as early as possible without too many false positives. My goal is to make it a lot more pleasant to use than other Scanners, while still getting all the important trading signals.

As this project is near completion, I would like to invite traders here to try it out, as it would help me a lot with debugging and fine tuning it’s performance. During market hours, it will be running on live data, and the rest of the time it would be running a replay of a previous trading day.

Feel free to message me or check my reddit profile for the download location, and login details ( will be free to use every on Monday and Tuesday )

If you experience any issues, please message me with any relevant screenshots. Most problems can be fixed by restarting the program a few times.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,424855,public,confidence,self,I’ve made a visual based stock scanner,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gujpjb/ive_made_a_visual_based_stock_scanner/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last week ended on a positive note as Trump's press conference was not very tough on China as many had feared.

The weekend was full of unrest in the US. International markets don't seem too concerned. Futures are a little choppy, looking to open near flat.

While we have dealt with riots in the US before it is new to have them during a pandemic. I think the chances of a second spike of COVID-19 cases are more likely now as social distancing appears to have been completely disregarded by many different parts of our society.

However, a trend worth to observe is that stock markets in most countries, irrespective of COVID-19 casualties and stimulus package from their respective governments have proved to be more resilient. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one such example that has witnessed the strong recovery from its lows of March 2020.

Reopening has been successful with the help of government relief and additional players joining in the effort to develop COVID vaccines and treatments. Riots around the U.S. have led to volatility, but will not likely have long-term effects on the economy. Here are the details: 

1. **Novavax (NVAX) starts P1 COVID vaccine trial and Merck (MRK) announce development of two vaccines and one treatment.** At the beginning of the week, two biopharma companies announced progress in the fight against COVID, with NVAX starting a P1 trial and MRK initiating vaccine and drug development. These two companies are only the latest to announced positive development against COVID. Merck, well known for their production of penicillin to help keep soldiers healthy to win WWII, is now taking on another war, the COVID pandemic. 
2. **General consensus seems to say, ""the worse is over"", as economies have demonstrated successful reopenings to-date.** Now that all states but New Jersey have plans of reopening, signs of economic life are re-emerging. Spending on hotels, restaurants, and flights have started picking up. “If this is the only wave \[of coronavirus\], it looks like we’ve bottomed out and the normalization process has begun,” said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings.
3. **However, COVID relief has been so great that the U.S. government is considering financial incentives for people to go back to work.** A new study by the University of Chicago show that two-thirds (68%) of jobless workers may earn more money from their state unemployment insurance plus the $600 weekly supplement from the federal government than they would have on the job. In fact, one in every five eligible workers would receive benefits that were double their lost earnings. Because benefits are so great, the U.S. government is worried that citizens may be disincentivized to go back to work. As a result, the Trump administration is considering a $450 per week bonus to return to work on top of wages. 
4. **Furthermore, riots across the U.S. after the tragic death of George Floyd demonstrate instability across the U.S. and is a wild card for the market.** Protests over the tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota, New York, etc. have resulted in violence, arson, and looting. Political and cultural instability never benefits the economy, especially as it's recovering from the devastating COVID blow. However, instability like this in the U.S. generally ends after a week or two once citizens turn from protest to discussion that hopefully results in a permanent societal change for the better.    

**Even with protests across the U.S., economic recovery from COVID continues, fueled by medical advancements and successful reopenings.** WX Capital believes the riots will contribute to volatility in the near-term as we saw in the last few days of trading last week. However, over a longer period, we believe that economic recovery will be sure and steady. Our investments in companies hit hardest by COVID is now starting to return well. Furthermore, we've lined up our portfolio with biotech companies with high-likelihood catalysts which will help us maintain our above-market returns.

**Commodities (10%)**

1. Gold Bullion Sovereign Coins (5%)
2. iShares Physical Silver ETC (SSLN) (5%)

**Cash 20%**

I chose HMWO and WLDS because I want to 'own the world'. They give me diverse global exposure to large, mid, and small cap. Together they give my c.60% exposure to the US.

Should I add iShares Core S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF USD (Acc) (GBP) (CSP1) to give me greater exposure to US large cap because it seems to dominate everything? I was thinking of reducing the proportion of my portfolio that I have in cash (down from 20% to 10%) by buying enough CSP1 to give me between 65% and 70% exposure to the US. Do you think the US market is going to be increasingly volatile over the next 6 months (coronavirus, 2020 Pre. Election, US-CN relations falling apart and the coming of Cold War II (if it isn't already here), and the race riots)?

I hold physical gold because it is the ultimate safe haven, a good hedge, and I will always have it if there is a major crash and if SHTF I can barter with it! Seems like US-CN relations are going to breakdown much further. The dollar's dominance will be challenged. Gold will rise...

Silver is at an all-time low, especially when compared with gold. It's also a good hedge.

I don't have any emerging markets because China dominates these. I think China will be hurt much worse than the US in Cold War II. Also, I think India-China relations will breakdown further as India rises. And India is not very stable internally. Also, places like India and Latin America have not yet seen the worst of coronavirus so now probably is not a good time to be investing in them in any case.

Sweden's tactic to help the Economy usually consists of printing money and increasing well fair spending (Health care, school, highway's etc) in recession to create more jobs and the opposite in economic booms to make the recession less bad. So we have a good track record of how printing money affects the economy.

Sadly for you U.S. citizens, printing money won't save the economy. Merly ease the crash landing that's about to come.

Think of it like this. The U.S economy is like a water balloon, when times are good people take out credit loans and spend (filling the balloon with water) until it becomes so big that holes appear so water rush out (recession).

What's currently happening is that Corona is slowly creating holes in the balloon as it spreads (Job loss). The Fed tried to counter this by filling the balloon with water (printing money). But no matter how fast the fed will try to fill the balloon, the water will rush out of the holes (That keep forming!) Faster than they can keep the money printing up.

The only way to fix the balloon, is by covering the holes. (A Corona virus cure) And sadly, no matter what the media tries to convey, the average vaccine takes 10 years to produce. This can barely be speed up with more funding since one must take time to observe what the vaccine does to your body before it can be released to the public. If you Google on interviews with medical professionals, most claim that due to the massive funding and focuse on the vaccine, a working cure with no side effects is at best 5 years away or 3 years away with side effects.
The 1,5 years away is IF we manage to convert an existing similar vaccine AND absolutely nothing goes wrong in any of the 3 vaccine stages. Which is if you haven't already guessed it. Almost impossible.

In concluding : 
For those of you that think that the fed can print their way out of this recession, I'm sad to say that it can't be done. Many EU countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany have tried. The best the money printing can do is to make the recession less worse than it could have been.

Hope you all keep safe in these troubling times.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,424287,public,confidence,self,Printing money to counter recession have been EU and sadly...

Would love to know people opinion on the (T.Rowe Price New Horizons Fund) or (PRNHX). 

Im going do as quick comparison of this fund against (Vanguards S&amp;P 500 Index) (VUSA), As I’m in the UK. 

(Before I start can anyone let me know where I can buy this fund in the UK, Thanks)

(FEES) 

First of all let’s compare the fees. (Vanguards, VUSA), Fees are very low at (0.07). Compared to (T.Rowe’s, PRNHX) Fees at (0.76). But the fees aren’t a deal breaker so let’s keep going.

(RETURN RATES)

(Average rates for 1 year, found on yahoo finance)

Now for the return rates. (Vanguards, VUSA) has a return rate of (1.04%). Compared to (T.Rowe’s, PRNHX) Return of (12.75)!

(RETURN ON INVESTMENT)

Now I’m going to compare the two funds on what really matters, the return on investment. 

(Vanguards, VUSA)

Monthly investment of - (£500) 
Investment Peroid of - (40 years)
End investment - (£293,783)
Fees - (£4,400)

(T.Rowe’s, PRNHX)

Monthly investment of - (£500) 
Investment Peroid of - (40 years)
End investment - (£4,859,870)
Fees - (£1,170,740)

I probably don’t  have everything correct so let me know where I’m wrong!

I believe (VUSA) is still a great investment, but (PRNHX) has a much better return on investment. 

Let me know what you think, And thank you for reading

I really want to get into the stock market and had been trying to educate myself for the past month, I have learned about very basic terms, my main source of education is from youtube and this subreddit, which I've followed for weeks(?) now and have learned a lot just by observing. I've also read about other newbies like me in here asking for advice and I have took note of those,

Problem is, being a newbie in my country sucks, there are a lot of sellouts in youtube where you'd think they're talking about legit stuff but then they try to sell you other crap that's not even associated with the stock market, or people who'd talk about how great the stock market is for like 30 minutes and then proceed to tell you that they need your money for a seminar. Most of them advertises their videos as ""Beginner"" or a ""How To"" but really they're just full of air where they'll talk about themselves for the majority of the video and talk about stuff nobody really gets (even people who knows more than me complains in the comments section),

Then I get into foreign educational sources, as I've said, here I understand a lot of you guys. You've helped quite a lot of newbies and have given solid advice. Most of the people in youtube from the US have also given really great beginner videos where they've spoken in detail the important parts and have not tried to sell me a seminar I can't attend. I've also looked at potential companies that many of you have suggested like MGM and Tesla. That may not be a lot of knowledge compared to you but that's already much more compared to my own knowledge about the stock in my own country

# **Expect more shocking economic data in the week ahead with the unemployment rate set to near 20%  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/expect-more-shocking-economic-data-in-the-week-ahead-with-the-unemployment-rate-set-to-near-20percent.html)**
*****
&gt; The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market.
*****
&gt; The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China’s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters. 
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump’s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China.
*****
&gt; “Hovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.
*****
&gt; “We saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,” she said. “The market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.”
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.
*****
&gt; “There’s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,” he said. “There’s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.”
*****
&gt; Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. 
*****
&gt; “This cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we’ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,” he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn’t always signal positives. 
*****
&gt; “On average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,” he said.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&amp;P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.
*****
&gt; But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. “When we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,” he said. 
*****
&gt; The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.  
*****
&gt; “These stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don’t think we’ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there’s a change in progress on a vaccine,” he said.
*****
&gt; President Trump’s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism.
*****
&gt; Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter’s stock hardest.  
*****
&gt; Emanuel said technology’ is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues.
*****
&gt; In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.

&gt; # Equities

&gt; US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&amp;P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Which would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn’t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.”

&gt; The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.

&gt; Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.

&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

&gt;  # International Stocks

&gt; The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng’s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong’s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.

&gt; The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.

&gt; European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.

&gt; # Fixed Income and Commodities

&gt; Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.

&gt; Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.

&gt; Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.

&gt; Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.

&gt; # Looking Ahead

&gt; Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.

&gt; On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday’s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.

*****

# Strong Breadth Surge

&gt; On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.

&gt; Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn’t mean they’ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy’s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday’s close, 96% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.

&gt; Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&amp;P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Breadth surges like we’ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.”

# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June’s First Trading Day

&gt; According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA’s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.

# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month

&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.

# May's Top Performing Stocks

&gt; After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.

&gt; This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.

&gt; Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.

&gt; In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.

# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991

&gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&amp;P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&amp;P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).

# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm

&gt; The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.

&gt; Equity fund flows remain negative. While there’s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.

&gt; Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.

Original post: 

I’m 14 and I’m earning about $5 a day from doing online surveys. I thought about just saving but trading or investing it seemed like a way better idea. It works perfectly because I’ve always wanted to learn

I’ve been doing research and I’m overwhelmed with just everything. It’s hard to avoid the BS on YouTube and find valuable content which is unfortunate. I’m confused with what I want to do. 

Day trading wouldn’t work for my schedule, I don’t want to be looking at graphs for 3 hours a day and it wouldn’t fit my schedule for the upcoming school years. 

Swing trading looks good, but so does long term investing. I don’t know of any other styles/methods if there are any, so I’m asking what would work for somebody like me.



New Question: 
What trading style would fit me the best? I want to take advantage of compound interest at my age (still need to research more about what compound interest is), but I also want to earn short-term money. Since I’m only 14, earning my own money just gives me so much freedom and I wouldn’t have to beg my parents for things. So after reading the previous text, what should I do and what do you recommend for me?

**Part 1/4 - What is the 4th Industrial Revolution?**

The Fourth Industrial Revolution can be described as the advent of ""cyber-physical systems"" involving entirely new capabilities for people and machines.

These capabilities are reliant on the technologies and infrastructure of the Third Industrial Revolution, but the Fourth Industrial Revolution represents entirely new ways in which technology becomes embedded within societies and even our human bodies.

A few examples include robotics, genome editing, 3D printing, new forms of machine intelligence, biotechnology, and approaches to governance that rely on cryptographic methods such as the blockchain.

As the novelist William Gibson famously said: ""The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.""

In many parts of the world, some aspects of the Second and Third Industrial Revolutions have yet to be experienced, due to the fact that new technologies are in some cases able to ""leapfrog"" older ones.

[As the United Nations pointed out in 2013](https://news.un.org/en/story/2013/03/435102-deputy-un-chief-calls-urgent-action-tackle-global-sanitation-crisis#.VpzAAfkrLIX), more people in the world have access to a mobile phone than basic sanitation.

In the same way, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is beginning to emerge at the same time that the third, digital revolution is spreading and maturing across countries and organisations.

As a result, there are a few key themes to consider when thinking about the consequences of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution will dramatically reshape economies, with enormous change predicted in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2/4 - Inequality:**

One of the primary issues this is likely to exacerbate is inequality.

For some context, the world's richest 1% have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people.

The wider trend of [Technological Deflation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE) does not sit well with Central Banks who are desperate to sustain 'growth' at all costs. 

Via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), money printing itself increases inequality due to asset price inflation.

[The recent splurge of fiat](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-fed-balancesheet/fed-balance-sheet-increases-to-record-6-13-trillion-idUSKCN21R3FR) indicates that inequality is heading in only one direction...

Moreover, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will lead to an upward bias of skill requirements, which disproportionally affects older and lower-income cohorts.

More than 50% of the world's population is now online, and roughly one million more people join the Internet each day.

Precision medicine, autonomous vehicles and drones are all fast-growing markets, while AI alone is expected to boost global growth by around 14% by 2030.

[A Report in 2017 by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages) looked at the impact of automation on the workforce.

***In the United States, a rapid automation scenario would result in the displacement of 73 million jobs, and up to 33% of the 2030 workforce may need to switch occupational groups.***

***The report concludes that by 2030, 3-14% of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories, and that all workers will need to adapt to increasingly capable machines. Some of that adaption will require higher educational attainment, or spending more time on activities that require social and emotional skills, creativity, high-level cognitive capabilities and other skills relatively hard to automate.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3/4 - Security:**

The digital nature of 4th Industrial Revolution technologies makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks that can take a multitude of forms, from data theft ransomware to the overtaking of systems with potentially harmful large-scale consequences.

Organised cybercrime groups are joining forces with their likelihood of detection and prosecution pretty low - [it is estimated that only 3 in 1000 cyber incidents see an arrest](https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors).

As well as this, the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution also offer expanded capabilities for waging war, which are increasingly accessible to both state and non-state actors.

On the frontier of emerging military technologies are those that [interact directly with the human brain to augment or even control soldiers](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-wants-soldiers-to-control-machines-with-their-minds-2019-12?r=US&amp;IR=T).

Even these are not limited to government military programmes.

According to James Giordano of Georgetown University Medical Center: ""It's not a question of if non state actors will use some form of neuroscientific techniques or technologies, but when, and which ones they'll use.""

The brain...is the next battle space

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4/4 - Community:**

The final piece to this discussion is the impact that this will have on individuals and communities.

Digital media is increasingly becoming the primary driver of our individual and collective framing of society and community, connecting more people than ever before but also *isolating* individuals in a maze of dopamine and polarizing propaganda.

Controversial or anti-establishment views can be further undermined by states and other actors willing to use new technologies and platforms to restrict speech.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the first where the tools of technology can become literally embedded within us and even purposefully change who we are at the level of our genetic makeup. 

It is completely conceivable that forms of radical human improvement will be available within a generation, innovations that risk creating entirely new forms of inequality and class conflict.

These emerging technologies will change what it means...to be human.

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Why would anyone listen to ""analysts"" who project market movements by looking exclusively at the performance charts?  Am I missing something?

Every other article on Seeking Alpha (which I understand might be the buzzfeed of fin analysis) hocks the next movement in the market based on the patterns on the graph indicating the performance of the market.  How does this ever pass as analysis to rational adults?

Intuitively this seems like stone age people worship constellations because they can't explain natural phenomena.  The graph is itself is a fiat reflection of fundamentals and the game theory of the market, it does not obey in laws of motion unrelated to that reality.

The personal savings rate hit a historic 33% in April, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday.

“There is a tremendous uncertainty and virus fear that is lingering and that is restraining people’s desire to go out and spend as they normally would,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. 

With the U.S. consumer accounting for more two-thirds of the economy, the economic recovery depends on whether the increase in savings is a result of shutdowns or structural changes in consumer habits, analysts said.

Yesterday morning President Trump signaled a crackdown on Twitter (**TWTR**) and all social media platforms with an executive order. The order was symbolic, retaliation for Twitter offering an alternative narrative to one of the President's tweets. Tech stocks suffered all day.

Markets were up broadly most of the day yesterday until the President announced a press conference about China. No other details have been provided. The administration appears to be supporting Beijing's Hong Kong crackdown. But continues to attack its the handling of COVID-19 crisis.

Markets finished in the red yesterday, selling off in the final hour. Futures are pointing to a lower open today. I'll be cautious today, may scale back position sizes to reduce risk.

**Watchlist:**

**TENX** is a low float, watching for a setup above $1.60

**NVUS** is a low float, resistance at $1.40

**HX** is a low float, big runner yesterday, resistance is at $1.60

**RNWK** is a lowish float, watching for a setup above $2.20

**ALRN** is a lowish float, moving on news, watching for a setup above $1.40

I have a plan of 70% return that I don't see why it won't work, but maybe I am missing something. Please let me know your thoughts. Here it is:

* Let's say I invest 1000$ Average return of SPX500 is about 10% a year.
* If I use leverage of of X10, I will pay 317.55$ in fees for one year.
* Although my return will be 1000$ - 317.55$ which is 683$, which is 68.3% of the initial investment. 

One problem I see is that it increases the risk to hit the stop loss, but then again, I can initially have let's say $2000, then I still invest $1000, if it closes I open it again, and again. I have 3 chances: to invest with $1000 and even if it closes 3 times, I still have a \~35% return. 

I have taken specifically X10 because it offers some room for volatility, although you can apply the same method with X100 and get a \~700% return. I am definitely missing something. I still see this method a low risk. And again, I am talking about normal market behavior. I will wait for the current instability to stop.

I have an open position in DKNG, with average cost of $20.70. As it is currently trading at around $38, I would like to lock in profit. However, I would not want to cash out when the price is rising as I would miss out on more profit. Thus I would like to set up a command to close my positions only when the price has fallen around 7% from its previous high.

For example, assuming that DKNG keeps on rising to $45 and subsequently has a correction of 10% ($45 - 10%) when it drops to $40.50, my command would have closed my position when it went past 7% correction ($45 - 7%) = $41.85 and my profit would be locked. 

I need help to set up such command in IBKR, can anyone help?

“So, if companies are increasingly meeting their financing needs elsewhere, it seems fair to ask what exactly the point of the stock market is these days. The growth of high-frequency trading, in which players dart in and out of the market seeking to profit from the tiniest price discrepancies, certainly lends credence to the idea that the market is now little more than a glorified casino. Some observers, though, contend that it actually serves a more nefarious purpose — that the market, instead of directing capital to its most productive uses, has essentially become a mechanism for draining capital out of the economy in order to funnel ever more of the nation’s wealth upward. This is being done, goes the argument, primarily through stock buybacks — companies repurchasing their own shares.”",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,422716,public,confidence,self,What is the stock market even for anymore?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gsi58g/what_is_the_stock_market_even_for_anymore/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'oN1k7uwpaj2BjiLAAL2n8xxtmp_guzyxB1wwwPkgSyc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Yrvs2ub-sebdHwfpLU_yTF3vIU121vXDZY0ufQM3VIg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=407d23768928c63cd4c3d2e1d1786f28c8da367f', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Yrvs2ub-sebdHwfpLU_yTF3vIU121vXDZY0ufQM3VIg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09324fc985ef810d89b77c571787b1a590cba0d8', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Yrvs2ub-sebdHwfpLU_yTF3vIU121vXDZY0ufQM3VIg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64dd481cad180344572c5ea0e797a736ab845852', 'width': 320}, {'height': 335, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Yrvs2ub-sebdHwfpLU_yTF3vIU121vXDZY0ufQM3VIg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13abf9ddc89260d8d7bb774cc2f7f048fc112f9a', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Yrvs2ub-sebdHwfpLU_yTF3vIU121vXDZY0ufQM3VIg.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=482da902586b59a1c2e6f9ae5c5b381e6e3b3bc8', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 550, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Yrvs2ub-sebdHwfpLU_yTF3vIU121vXDZY0ufQM3VIg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b571f9659f14681be4792732891d03ccd80d3bfa', 'width': 1050}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

I built a database for stock factor rankings.

[https://web.genuineimpact.io/](https://web.genuineimpact.io/)

It ranks US listed stocks with a market cap of more than $2B. It is free, available to use for everyone and remain so. No promotions, re-directs, commercials or swags. A pure database to help your research process.

As someone who used to work in asset management, I know the importance of having something like this as a screening tool for idea generation. I see no reason why this sort of level of intelligence should be only available inside large firms. Hence I made one for individuals to use.

I want to find like-minded people who like to analyse stocks with a factor framework. Happy to hear your thoughts or comments and I shall enhance this database with feedback.

A little disclaimer is needed...

I don't intend to make any profits or in any shape or form benefit from this. The site is hosted on Notion which is sort of like a github but can look better.

Congratulations to the few BULLs left in this market, you are the winners and will continue to be if trumppump keeps pumping bad news in the market. 

The negative news continues with a big ACE card thrown in over the weekend about a fake trade war with China brewing. That really helped us get past the 300o barrier with S&amp;P which coincides with 25000 phycological barrier with Dow.

We need lots of negative news as COVID scare is dying down. We need major stuff like more trade war fake scare with China or fake war with Iran. 

All the negative news across all media outlets such as FBN, CNN, CNBC and others, is helping bring in more bears, shorts and we will shatter recent records on S&amp;P very soon:

S&amp;P - &gt; 3000 by end of  June

S&amp;P -&gt; 3300 by end of July

S&amp;P - 3750 by Nov 4rd Elections after which we will see a correction

S&amp;P - 3000 by Dec 21 2020

&amp;#x200B;

The USA currently spends 6 trillion dollars and takes in 3 trillion in taxes. It's in 26 trillion of debt, the situation is only getting worse. It's in an equivalent situation to a company like GM or Ford where it's essentially zombified and can only last so long as interest rates stay at rock bottom so the debt remains just about serviceable. What happens if we get inflation, how do you control it? Using interest rates. What happens if you put rates up? The debt becomes unserviceable, unless you print more money. It's a disaster that seems obvious.

In mid March my portfolio was down approximately 34 %. I’ve been DCA’ing and am currently 95 % stocks, 5 % cash and today my portfolio is back to where it was at before the pandemic meaning I’m no longer -34 % but 0 % compared to back then. 

My holdings are: 
45 % global ETF (mostly tech, health, finance but pretty diversified)
33 % HM 
22 % RL 

On average I’m 60 % retail. 

I used to not own any HM or RL but strictly the global ETF. I bought into those two clothing stocks because I was certain neither would go bankrupt and that they were cheap at the moment. It paid off but that can change if a second wave of virus presents itself. It’s also a possibility they’ll both stay flat or just experience a downward trend for many years to come. It’s also possible both will continue up and maybe sometime in the future reach an all time high. Both companies are working intensely on going more digital and I think especially HM have potential in this regard. Ralph Lauren is super popular in Asia and online sales surged 70 % in China as of their latest earnings report. 

Year to date: 
Global ETF down 11 percent
HM down 26 percent
RL down 32 percent 

Now, I didn’t like it when I was down 35 % mid March. I felt really stupid for not having sold anything while everyone else was selling, or at least so it seemed. Being back to where I was at all time high is nice but I’m not sure where to go from here. I probably need a lot of the money for buying a house in about 1-2 years from now but other than that I can let it stay untouched completely as I have a safe job with steady income. Retail is not something I would normally invest so heavily in. I’m more of a tech guy. But tech seems so expensive right now. Should I stay 95 % stocks, 5 % cash or go back to 70/30? Should I sell all stocks, be all cash for a while and be grateful that I’m not 35 % down as I was just 50 days ago? Should I sell all HM and RL and go back to strictly being in a global ETF?

Saving a few hundred bucks is nothing at this point when I've lost multiple thousand anyway. Worst case it's a learning lesson.

That said, I'm wondering what may happen from the few class action lawsuits that are around that I've heard of. Of course any actual recovery is probably both unlikely and a long way away, I want to make sure that I'm eligible to take part in the lawsuit/recovery in the event it happens.

I bought 40 shares at $6.50, and that was me getting in what I considered to be late (opened my trading account when it was at $4.93 and by the time my funds hit the stock was already well into the high $5s). It looks like a good move so far, but anything can happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway,  I've been holding... holding... waiting to get my big chunk into the market (not much, \~$2K). Haven't made big buys yet, but yesterday and today I've put in limit buys for 5 stocks I've been staring at for 2 weeks, and now I've missed a couple different +10% days. Now where I've put my limits is much higher than it would've been last week. It doesn't feel right because I've been holding off waiting for another drop, but it doesn't seem like it's coming now. The Memorial Day rally has caused me to rethink this and now I feel like I may need to get back in before it's WAY too late. 

&amp;#x200B;

I opened my Fidelity account right smack dab in the middle of the bottom out, but the funds weren't available until days later when the market had already corrected itself. Unfortunately for me, I decided to hold, take notes, and watch the markets every day since, hoping for another dip. The problem is the opposite happened with the Memorial Day rally and now I'm afraid that dip might not happen, and if it does and I buy in now, I'll take unnecessary losses that may have been avoided with some patience and trust in my fundamental knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is this. Do I buy in now? Do I continue to be patient for what could be an inevitable 2nd crash or down spike? Or do you think we are in the clear and I should just buy now and try to forget about what could have been? It just really feels like this rally bubble could burst, even if it happens gradually. At the same time, it may not.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I've got limit buy orders in intentionally too low to hit today, probably. But this is what got me here in the first place. Could really use at least some conversation about it. No one here is going to convince me either way, but it is nice to read others having the same concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record, I am a purely fundamental trader. The stocks I've been staring at are ALT, SAVE, LUV, CCL, PENN, and NVAX.

Has the ship sailed for us bears?

 \_\_\_\_\_

U.S. stock markets have been in rally-mode this week, as Wall Street grows more optimistic about the economy reopening, despite uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic and growing tensions between the U.S. and China.

The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30) closed above 25,000 for the first time since March on Wednesday, while the [S&amp;P 500](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500) topped the 3,000-mark, putting it back above its 200-day moving average – a key level watched by traders.

The easing of lockdowns, optimism about an eventual COVID-19 vaccine and massive U.S. stimulus have powered a recent stock market rally.

The Dow, S&amp;P (NYSE:[SPY](https://www.investing.com/etfs/spdr-s-p-500)) and [Nasdaq](https://www.investing.com/indices/nasdaq-composite) are up 40.2%, 38.5% and 41.9% respectively above their March 23 lows.

 The impressive recovery rally has propelled Wall Street’s main averages back towards their respective all-time highs reached earlier this year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index just 4.3% away from its record peak. 

The bulls have had the upper hand in recent weeks, however that could change should the war of words between Washington and Beijing escalate further.

That could be the catalysts to take the market lower, bringing the correction most are expecting to come.

I thought it might be handy to do a quick TLDR of the fed's beige book just to keep myself (and hopefully you) up to speed on where the economy stands and where we might be headed. Let me preface this by saying I'm not an economist and most of you probably already know most of this stuff. If you want to read the whole thing, it's **[here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202005.htm)** and is a good way to get a broad outlook on the US economy as a whole. I read it almost every release and it's quite an easy read and pretty enjoyable. Alright here we go: 

**The Obvious Part:**

The economy is in the shitter (duh). Employment is down across the board, but certain industries are hit harder than others. Some of the hardest hit industries for reasons that should be obvious are: 

- Hospitality and tourism
- Retail sales/establishments
- Auto sales

If the reasons aren't obvious, it's cause everything is closed. Residential home sales also dropped significantly from their already depressed levels mostly due to restrictions on showings as well as sellers deciding maybe the best time to sell their home isn't during the middle of a global pandemic when 20% of the country has no income and the 80% who do might be infected with something that could kill you.


**A Little Light ... But Not Much:**

Interestingly auto sales actually saw a little boost, but they had declined something like 95% as of the last beige book in April, so I'm not sure a boost really matters when you're being boosted from zero. Turns out people don't buy cars and houses when they're unemployed, even in debt-obsessed America. Speaking of debt, it seems pretty much the only lending going on is PPP loans and forbearances for those who can't make their payments. This extended into the commercial real estate market which is concerning especially considering the renewed reporting on the whistleblower complaint from last year that banks like Wells Fargo (of course it's Wells Fargo...it's always Wells Fargo isn't it?) and Deutsche Bank are engaging in [systematic manipulation of commercial mortgage backed securities](https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds) which effectively means that a boatload of commercial renters (read: hotels, office buildings, etc) that already have debt out the wazoo (a highly technical financial term) might not be able to pay their bills...but I digress

**A Few Other Notes:**

Prices in general were down. Certain things saw boosted demand and mildly inflated prices, in particular essential retail items like cleaning supplies, meat, fresh fruit and veggies, etc. Basically, things you need during a pandemic. Aside from that, almost everything is priced lower due to lower demand and supply chain interruptions. Some of the higher pricing on things like PPE, food and medical supplies is offset by the fact that the firms selling them now have additional costs due to social distancing regulations and decreased foot traffic. As far as employment and wages, wages that are still in place are mixed at best: the fed reported that in general, wages were flat or down in non-essential sectors but many firms reported temporary or even permanent wage increases, or at least not cuts, for essential workers. 

**Where We're Going:**

The short answer is no one really knows. Everyone hopes that we're out of the woods, but the reality is that we aren't. We don't know if a second wave of COVID-19 will force us to shut everything down again, and most firms don't seem to know how soon they'll be returning to full employment, or if they will need to make more cuts and issue more layoffs. I think the fed themselves said it best: 

&gt; Although many contacts expressed hope that overall activity would pick-up as businesses reopened, the outlook remained highly uncertain and **most contacts were pessimistic** about the potential pace of recovery.

**But ghostofgbt, what's that mean for our precious stonks?!**

Yes yes I know. Fed go brrrr and all that. I believe the market will continue to drift upwards from here despite the current economic climate, and even if we do see a temporary pullback in the near future. The two primary emotions in the markets are fear and greed, which often *both* manifest themselves as fear: FOMO (fear of missing out) and FOFL (fear of further loss). At this point I believe the fed action of [inflating its balance sheet more than 70% to over $7 trillion in just three months](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm) by buying basically everything in sight including ETFs holding junk bonds - and despite its unknown consequences for the long term health of the economy and the US dollar - has squashed the second type of fear into oblivion. There is no more widespread fear of further loss as we are nearly back to where we started with tech stocks leading the charge (as is custom...all hail our Amazonian overlord). I believe the average investor knows that even if we begin to drift back down, there are so many people who missed the first rebound ready to BTFD at the first sign of a retracement that it will take a mass panic to overtake the dip buyers.

That means the only thing left is FOMO, and a bunch of bears who have been sitting on the sidelines and are now salty about missing out on 50% gains on bankrupt and debt-laden companies that were bailed out by the fed. By all accounts, the bears are right. The market should be in the dumps with the economy, but it's not, because everyone believed that's exactly where it would go, and the rebound was so ferocious that it caught everyone but the most YOLO-prone investors off guard. So I'm not saying we're out of the woods yet - we're clearly not as evidenced by the findings in the last two beige books - but the fear of further loss is gone. The panic is gone. The only thing that's left is FOMO, and a bunch of people with cash they didn't put in at the bottom who are now filled with regret and get closer and closer to just saying ""fuck it, I'm in"" with every gap up. IMHO, the only thing that can bring the market back down with any sort of force is a second shutdown. Rising cases won't do it on their own but if we have to shut down again things will get ugly because it will mean that the future is even more uncertain, and if there's one thing the market truly hates, it's uncertainty.

So there ya go. My TLDR of today's beige book and (probably mostly useless) thoughts on where we're headed. Now, cue the bad news so the market can gap down 4% tomorrow and make this whole post look like nonsense.

DED represents an estimated $5B global market dominated by two prescription eye drop products: Restasis (Allergan) and Xiidra (Novartis). Restasis, approved in 2003 and anticipated to go generic this year, achieved net sales of $1.1B in 2019. Xiidra, approved in 2016, is forecast to reach \~$1.2B in net sales in 2025. OC-01 offers a similar or moderately superior magnitude of efficacy based on pivotal P3 data (ONSET-1 &amp; ONSET-2). OC-01 has a competitive edge given its ROA and rapid time to impact (on the order of weeks), as current agents are associated with eye stinging / discomfort and may take up to several months to achieve effect. We project &gt;250% upside over the current market cap of \~$730M based on estimated peak sales &gt;$1B and potential M&amp;A takeout value.

**Key Takeaways**

* We project peak sales &gt;$1B for OC-01 based on a differentiated product profile, supporting a target valuation of \~$2.6B (&gt;250% upside over current market cap).
* The OC-01 program is de-risked from a regulatory standpoint given positive pivotal trials: we estimate a \~90% probability of approval (NDA filing in 4Q20).
* As a small biotech, OYST faces significant execution risks for commercialization given the competitive landscape (Allergan, Novartis) and the consumer-driven market, which will necessitate substantial investment in direct-to-consumer commercial efforts.
* We believe OYST can best maximize shareholder value via an acquisition. While OYST has indicated that it is planning to launch OC-01 on its own, its relatively small market cap (\~$730M) in relation to its regulatory-ready asset make OYST an attractive takeover target. Comparable deals the OYST team could point to include Novartis’ 2019 acquisition of Xiidra from Shire, which closed for $3.4B upfront and $1.9B in milestone payments. Potential partners would bring an existing commercial infrastructure in ophthalmology, such as but not limited to incumbents Allergan/AbbVie or Bausch + Lomb.
* However, even if no acquisition occurs, OYST still has plans to commercialize OC-01 independently in the U.S., outlining a 150-200 rep sales force and direct-to-consumer campaigns.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Substantial unmet need for a therapy with rapid onset of effect and an alternative ROA:*** Patients today are limited to over-the-counter artificial tears, which provide only transient relief, or prescription eye drop therapies which can take months to take effect and can cause significant eye irritation, impacting patient quality of life and compliance. 
* ***Large patient population offers substantial market growth potential:*** \~16M adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with DED, though only \~10% are receiving prescription therapy (&lt;2 M). OYST cites that \~7 M diagnosed patients have tried and failed current options, suggesting significant pent-up demand for an efficacious prescription therapy with superior tolerability to current SOC. Even just a fraction of these patients represents a significant commercial opportunity.
* ***NDA filing for OC-01 expected 2H20:*** After announcing data from a second positive pivotal trial (ONSET-2) earlier this month, OYST plans to file their NDA with the FDA during 2H20. OYST expects commercial launch in 4Q21, and announced plans to hire 150-200 dedicated sales reps, which they expect will be able to target &gt;80% of DED prescribers (both ophthalmologists and optometrists).
* ***Peak sales estimate &gt;$1B*****:** Analyst consensus and our own projections suggest OC-01 could achieve peak sales of $1-1.3B given the large population, high unmet need, and differentiated product profile. Assuming price parity to Restasis and Xiidra, capturing just \~5% of the \~5M patients who have tried and failed current options could translate into &gt;$1B in sales, even before including sales from new patient starts and patients switching from other medications.
* ***Probability-adjusted valuation of $2.3-3B:*** We forecast a \~90% chance of approval given positive P3 data, giving us a probability-adjusted peak sales estimate of $0.9-1.2B. A peak sales multiple of \~2.5x supports a valuation of \~$2.6B, representing &gt;250% upside over current market cap (\~$730M). 
* ***We believe there is a high likelihood that OYST will receive acquisition offers:*** We anticipate M&amp;A interest in OYST given its attractive market cap relative to its stage of development and the high barrier to commercial entry in this indication. OYST leadership has also previously explicitly not precluded the idea of an acquisition. We expect large players in this space to at least kick the tires on a deal and for OYST to listen hard, as a deal would be to mutual benefit.
* ***Additional stock offering closed on 5/19, creating a window to capture value:*** OYST closed an additional public offering on 5/19 at $28, raising \~$120M in preparation for OC-01 commercialization and further development. This dilutive capital drove OYST’s per share value back down to pre-ONSET-2 readout levels, creating a window to invest at a diluted price point.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Independent commercialization would be challenging and expensive:*** There is substantial execution risk for OC-01 launch as OYST would be competing with much larger players in Allergan and Novartis. In a highly consumer-driven market like DED, direct-to-consumer strategies will be incredibly important. For context, Allergan spent nearly $650M on Restasis advertising in 2016 - 2017 (when competitor Xiidra launched). OYST, meanwhile, reported \~$130M in cash and cash equivalents in their Q120 filing (though just raised an additional \~$120M via public offering). OYST leadership has outlined a 3-part strategy encompassing investments in speciality sales reps, DTC marketing, and payer engagement. Driving prescriber and patient awareness of OC-01 will require a heavy commercial lift.
* ***No pipeline to fuel long-term growth:*** OYST’s R&amp;D strategy is primarily focused on indication expansion for OC-01. While OYST also holds the rights to OC-02, which had previously reached P2 in DED, the program appears to be deprioritized for the time being. OYST will live or die by its ability to get OC-01 to approval and punch above its weight in the market.
* ***DED market is becoming increasingly competitive:*** Other novel products and the anticipated launch of Restasis generics could disrupt the DED landscape. For example, Sun Pharma recently launched Cequa, a higher concentration of the same active molecule as Restasis, while Kala Pharmaceutial’s Eysuvius recently read out a third P3 trial (required after an FDA rejection last year). However, for the most part these therapies are not expected to meaningfully detract from OC-01’s unique value proposition as an intranasal formulation.
* ***OYST requires substantial additional capital:*** OYST will likely need to identify additional sources of cash (e.g., out-licensing ex-U.S. commercial rights to OC-01) to fund OC-01 commercialization if it does not receive any acquisition offers.

* Total gain / loss, **\*including dividends paid out\*** 
* How long you've held the stock (in days or months) 
* I'm Long or Short (but the previous bullet would answer that quickly so this isn't mandatory)

It sounds kind of simple but I can't seem to find something that does all these things including dividends. There's lots of portfolio options that will show your total up/down on the price but doesn't include dividends for the total gain or show the length of time owned. 

I understand I could create a spreadsheet and hand input all this stuff, but before I do that, I was wondering if there's a killer tool (or even a basic tool) that does this that I can't seem to find. I've tried so many websites and portfolio products but nothing seems to include dividends or easily show how long you've held it. I don't need a lot more than all this. (More things are nice!

**Pain Point / What I'm Trying To Solve:**

I get paralyzed in kind of a 'sunk gains' mentality and am slow to sell my winners and take money off the table. For instance, I held Apple for almost 10 years, and recently sold it; in retrospect, I realize I could have jumped in and out of Apple 3-5 times in that time and made exponentially more money (especially the past 2 years). I need to stop getting paralyzed and afraid of taking winnings, so I want to track the total income (including dividends) over time, so that I can visually see and feel more motivated to trade in/out and take my winnings when I get 50% or more gains, rather than just sitting and riding through rollercoasters of ups and downs.

1. It's a popular brand in Canada that every female I know is aware of. 

2. They have a nice e-commerce site that friends have continued to use throughout the pandemic

3. They have earnings coming out tomorrow. 

My strategy was to buy and then sell right before earnings to make a small profit and the stock is currently sitting at 18 bucks a share. 

My question to people on here more experienced

1. Should I take my money and let the ""profit"" ride, basically providing me with free shares (other than the tax on profit of course)

2. Do I sell it all, and buy back in tomorrow after a dip. By that I mean do companies usually dip (sell the news) after earnings?

&amp;#x200B;

Anchors Joe Kernen and Andrew Ross Sorkin got into an uncommonly heated exchange during CNBC’s morning show “Squawk Box” on Wednesday. The co-hosts’ fiery back-and-forth has drawn attention on social-media platforms and may highlight the perception of the role of the media in characterizing the state of affairs amid the worst public health crisis in a century, with Kernen accusing Sorkin of overreacting and Sorkin saying Kernen has underreacted to the coronavirus pandemic for political reasons:

***‘You panicked about the market, panicked about COVID, panicked about the ventilators, panicked about the PPE, panicked about ever going out again, panicked that we’d ever get back to normal.’***

— Joe Kernen

Tensions erupted on-air between the pair, as Kernen outlined what he perceives as an overreaction to the COVID-19 outbreak that was [first identified in Wuhan, China, late in 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-coronavirus-from-wuhan-china-now-has-a-name-covid-19-2020-02-11?mod=article_inline) and has infected 5.6 million people globally and claimed more than 351,000 lives, according to data compiled by [Johns Hopkins University,](https://www.cnbc.com/search/?query=Kernen&amp;qsearchterm=Kernen&amp;mod=article_inline) as of Wednesday morning.

A total of 1,287 of S&amp;P's ratings are now on a downgrade warning -- either with 'negative outlooks' where a move might take two years, or on 'CreditWatch with negative implications' where the risk is almost immediate.

It tops 1,028 in the wake of the financial crisis in 2009 and comes despite nearly 700 downgrades already being impacted by COVID-19 in recent months.

I wonder if the Fed and Congress can prop up the market indefinitely. I wonder if they will give out before the markets legs get back under it. I wonder what a second wave of COVID might do in the fall, etc. But of course I suffer from FOMO.  That FOMO is rationalized as “Don’t fight the Fed”, “Trend is friend”, and other cute little sayings. So I’m splitting the difference. I have about 50% of my portfolio sitting out as cash. But I personally would like a safety valve on the 50% that’s in. Something more than just stop losses. Something that will save me from taking too massive a hit should the bottom fall out and I had an idea. So please tell me what you think. 

So first, I buy 50x shares of VIXY and 100x shares of SVXY. SVXY is a half-leveraged inverse VIXY. Then I sell short-term covered calls on SVXY because even though I expect it to rise, I don’t expect it to rise quickly. I can then use that money to buy short-term puts. So if the market takes a dive, VIXY should spike, SVXY should drop half as much, my puts gain value. The bigger the market drop, the more it makes. And it’s paid for by the calls I’m selling. The loss in value of the SVXY shares I’m holding should be negated by the gain in value of the VIXY I’m holding. And if I do this with the 50% of money that’s currently sitting in cash, I haven’t pulled money from participating in the rally to do it. 

So am I thinking about this right? Would this be a way to break even/make a small amount of money with this 50% that’s sitting in cash right now during a rally. And get a big payout if the market takes a dive? It seems almost too good to be true, so I’d love some input.

I started off small when the market crashed in March and have been slowly adding to my account. So far I've been able to ride the obvious bounceback pretty well (minus an ill-advised foray into **DAL** and **ALK**), but now that things are starting to settle it's getting a bit tougher to find good value. I was hoping I could get some insight/advice on how to proceed. First, here's my portfolio as it currently stands before the bell:

* **MSFT** \- 47.2% (+5.36%)
* **DFS** \- 17.2% (+41.04%)
* **DKNG** \- 10.8% (+10.41%)
* **OFC** \- 9.7% (+10.77%)
* **TGT** \- 9.0% (+4.01%)
* **ENPH** \- 6.1% (-15.21%)

The big thing moving forward is that I'm not looking to hold anything super long term unless it's growing at a good clip because it's likely I'll be cashing out my account in no more than 2 years. With that in mind, here's what I currently think about my portfolio:

* I know **MSFT** and **TGT** are considered pretty solid bets for the long term, but both appear to have stagnated close to their ATH's. Given my shorter term outlook, I'm not sure if I should continue to hold them or move onto something that will net me better short term returns.
* **DFS** I think still has value, but I also know that its banking wing is what's been weighing it down compared to the other major credit cards. I'm unsure if I should hang onto it or take my gains and run (though it looks like it rocketed up again first thing this morning).
* **OFC** I took because of those sweet REIT dividends (even though **OFC** is on the lower side for a REIT). I think they'll be one of the few that won't be hit too hard by a recession since they focus on government contracts and data centers.
* **ENPH** I took because their outlook looked very strong as a major part manufacturer for solar panels. Naturally I bought at the high. This is the only one I'm currently holding that I bought purely off of professional outlook instead of my gut. Now trying decide if I should hold and hope it comes back up or cut my losses.
* **DKNG** is the only one I'm married to at the moment. I think they're going to skyrocket once sports really start going again, especially football.

If I do sell anything above, these are the main options I had been looking at to replace them:

* **BP** and **XOM** \- both appear to still be pretty low relative to the other oil stocks, and I think they'll bounce back pretty strong now that quarantines are being lifted and people are moving again.
* **DIN** and **DRI** \- I missed the best times to buy these, but I think they still have value. Seems like they should bounce back strong with people getting out again.
* **PLAY** \- Riskier than **DIN** and **DRI**, but also sitting at a better value right now. Seems to me it should also bounce back strong once people start getting out again.

Also open to suggestions if anyone has any other stocks they really like.

Up until the end of last week you could always find an article calling for the market to crash again. This week that viewpoint is mostly silent.

Bears appear to have given up as markets broken out to new highs. I think the bears are tired of getting burned and can't afford to be squeezed anymore.

1-2% daily gains are not typical of bull markets. Markets can make extreme moves when a lot of participants take a long time to admit they are wrong. We could continue up for a while I'll remain bullish until the charts prove me wrong.

Wouldn’t it be great to have a place where we can share our valuable insights, DD and news with whom we want when we want.

I’m building an app to which other traders can hook there apps (one guy build an option trading algorithm where he would make X amount of profit in 13 weeks, I haven’t heard from him in a while so I’m guessing it didn’t go according to plan). The app also has a polling bot (on earnings for example) news, messaging, an earnings calendar which will be customizable to the companies you follow and portfolio analytics.

It’s still a work in progress but if you would like to subscribe for when it’s finished please let me know.

Wells Fargo


We added two positions in the quarter. One of them was megabank Wells Fargo.
The COVID-19 crisis caused a lot of pain for bank investors during the first quarter, and Wells Fargo
was no exception. In fact, the stock was dropping even before the virus reached NYC, down about
13% in January while the broader market was flat. WFC then proceeded to fall 47% to its lows on the
year around $25. We invested towards the end of the quarter, with an average price of ~$27.50.
What we saw in Wells Fargo was a bank with a long history of solid, growing earnings that is facing a
number of short- to medium-term problems:


Business-practice issues of its own making.


Potential COVID-19 related loan losses.


Falling interest rates.
We could fill many pages with discussion of the firm’s client relations and HR scandals -- opening
accounts for clients without their permission, putting wealth management clients in unsuitable
investment products, failing to respond to HR complaints, gender bias in hiring and promotion,
illegally repossessing borrower motor vehicles, etc. The market has punished the stock since these


The market has punished the stock since these issues came to light, with WFC underperforming peers by 50% since 2015.
Wells Fargo today reminds us of Facebook in Q4 2018 (which we wrote about here). In both cases,
investors unduly shunned a fundamentally sound company that made mistakes involving breaches of
customer trust. While admittedly reprehensible, the scandals at both FB and WFC are more impactful
to social media sentiment than to long-term free cash flows.


Availability bias causes human beings to place disproportionate weight on this type of story.
Breaches of customer trust rightfully disgust the public, and investors find it distasteful to be long a
company whose CEO is chastised by Congress. Our investment strategy is predicated on identifying
and exploiting these investor biases; we thrive on situations where short-term issues obfuscate the
underlying health and long-term earnings power of a business.


The vast majority of revenue for Wells Fargo is generated by interest on loans, and we don’t see much
evidence that the long-term volume or credit quality of these loans have been a!ected by the
scandals of the past three years.


In fact, Wells Fargo’s relationship with consumers and businesses appears to be healthy. All of the
following key metrics are flat-to-up since 2016: loans (flat), deposits (flat), customer checking
accounts (+3%), debit card purchase volume (+21%), consumer card purchase volume (+17%),
commercial card purchase volume (+28%), and branch visit satisfaction score (+3%). But even these
figures understate the health of WFC’s business: the lack of growth in the loan book is due entirely to
an asset cap put in place by regulators to punish the company for its transgressions. If not for that
cap, loans and deposits would almost certainly have grown.


For this 168-year-old franchise, we paid less than 7 times trailing earnings.
We do expect those earnings to fall in the short term as COVID-19-related loan loss provisions hit the
income statement. However, WFC’s balance sheet and core profitability provides plenty of margin to
absorb these losses. Wells Fargo’s net charge-o!s peaked at 2.2% of average loans outstanding during
the financial crisis. While this level of net charge-o!s would’ve been enough to wipe out last year’s
earnings, it would not have impaired the firm’s book equity (assuming that dividends and buybacks
were suspended temporarily).


Our base case is that the current crisis will be extremely sharp in the short term, but not worse than
the financial crisis in the long term unemployment, home prices, and loan defaults.
For one, consumers are in a better position. In 2008, debt service payments (mostly due to high
mortgage payments) were over 13% of disposable income. Today, that number is below 10%. US
households’ equity in their homes has doubled since year-end 2008, to almost $20 trillion today.
Second, the banking sector -- whose meltdown exacerbated if not caused the 2008 crisis -- is much
better capitalized, with Tier 1 common equity ratios up from about 8% in 2007 to 12% today.2
Interest rates have fallen substantially -- mortgage rates, for example, have fallen by about half a
percent in the last year -- and thus Wells Fargo will generate less net interest income. Current Street
estimates are for $43.9b in net interest income, a decline of $3.3b versus 2019. Given that lower
interest rates are prevalent across the yield curve, we expect this to continue for the foreseeable
future.


However, we believe Wells Fargo has a significant opportunity to o!set much of that lost income by
cutting costs. The firm’s efficiency ratio,” the ratio of non-interest expenses to revenue, has become
one of the worst in the industry in recent years. Partly this is due to the firm’s regulatory problems,
which we estimate have cost $5b per year in legal fees, settlements, and compliance costs. As they
put these issues behind them, we think they should be able to achieve an efficiency ratio similar to
their peers at JP Morgan and Bank of America. This implies they may be able to shed $8-10b of total
costs, which would more than o!set the lost interest income from lower rates. Management has
stated that they are focused on this task.


Over time, we estimate that WFC will be able to generate about $15-18b of profits per year, only
slightly lower than the $18-20b they generated between 2017 and 2019. The stock trades at 6-7.5x the
new earnings level, which we find quite cheap given the long-term stability of the business and the
stickiness of client accounts.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,421083,public,confidence,self,Wells Fargo stock Analysis,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/graa71/wells_fargo_stock_analysis/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shares of Netflix, Shopify, Peloton and Zoom, all companies that once benefited from consumers sheltering in place across the country, closed lower Tuesday. The moves come despite a strong day for the broader markets, which have seen steep lows due to the pandemic. 

Netflix stock, which hit a 52-week high last week, closed down 3.4%. E-commerce platform Shopify, which supplies businesses with means to sell products online, dropped nearly 7% after reaching a 52-week high Tuesday. Shares of Peloton, a digital fitness company, dropped nearly 9%. Zoom, the videoconferencing software company that drew massive users, dropped more than 4%. 

The idea that society may be reopening sooner rather than later could mean that consumers will return to some of their old habits, spending less time at home. 

“The virus appears to be coming under control,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, wrote in a note to clients. “Lockdowns have been relaxed and we have not seen a resurgence in the virus.”

Some trades valued the Chinese company between $105 billion and $110 billion on the secondary markets. It has also traded as high as $140 billion.

This further cements their position as the world's most valuable startup.

In 2018, ByteDance closed a massive $3 billion funding round, [with funding from major investors such as SoftBank and KKR, valuing the company at $75 billion.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/26/bytedance-raises-3bn-funding-become-worlds-biggest-privately/)

However, the recent private transactions in the secondary market indicate that it's value has increased by more than 33% from two years ago.

By the way, a secondary market transaction is when private company stock is sold to another private party.

This is in contrast to primary market transactions, where companies sell directly to investors.

Stock in the secondary market is usually valued at a discount to primary shares because it is less liquid and there are fewer financial details on company performance available to investors.

It was recently announced that TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally and, [in the first quarter of 2020, it generated the most downloads for any app ever in a quarter, with 315 million installs across the App Store and Google Play.](https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-2-billion)

TikTok’s record breaking surge in downloads comes amid the lock-down, as the population looks for it's next dopamine hit.

The $100 billion valuation reflects expectations by investors that ByteDance will keep pulling in advertisers.

**Tiger Global, rumoured to be one of the buyers in the secondary market, estimates that ByteDance will grab 19% of China's online advertising market this year, compared to the 4% of the market it captured in 2017.**

Total digital ad spending in China is expected to reach $81 billion this year.

In the past decade, only two companies have traded at a higher premium than ByteDance in the secondary markets.

According to Andrea Walne, a partner at Manhattan Venture Partners who follows the secondary markets: ""The trading of ByteDance is reflective of the global wave of consumers who agree that ByteDance can displace Facebook as the leading social network.""

What are your thoughts on this? 

In 2019, Facebook fell out of the top 10 in Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, dropping to 14th place from ninth, [as the estimated value of its brand declined 12% to $39.9 billion.](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/10/these-are-the-best-global-brands.html)

At the end of 2019, 30% of the tech insiders who read The Information chose Facebook as the [most disappointing service of the decade.](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/elon-musk-is-tech-founder-of-the-decade-subscribers-say)

However, in terms of TikTok, it hasn't always been plain sailing...

It has faced criticism regarding the censoring of videos that do not please China, and has faced [accusations that it is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing)

In 2019, lawmakers raised concerns about TikTok's growing influence in the United States, and two senior members of Congress asked US intelligence to [determine whether it poses ""national security risks.""](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-tiktok/u-s-senators-call-for-intelligence-probe-into-chinese-owned-app-tiktok-idUSKBN1X32J3)

Last week, it was announced that [Kevin Mayer, Disney's former Head of Streaming, will be TikTok's new CEO](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/05/18/tiktok-is-making-a-disney-executive-its-new-ceo/#5154e30056a7), and will serve as COO at ByteDance.

Mayer's top priority will be to prove to American lawmakers, regulators and consumers that they can trust the Chinese-owned app with their data.

And that is going to be one uphill battle...

Gap Downs: NONE

SPY gapping up over the 200 day moving average. Large gap days are often the hardest to trade. Choppy, movement in most stocks at the initial open for the past couple weeks, most likely will continue for a while. If you are getting chopped up at open, be patient and look for pullbacks, secondary plays or for the market to find direction and moving averages to catch up before placing trades. Many stocks are gapping up after being very extended which can be a sign of an exhaustion gap so keep that in mind while choosing stocks to trade. Hope everyone had a good weekend. Back to the grind.

I'm hoping someone can clear it up for me.

&amp;#x200B;

The common thing I've read/heard about beta is that a beta of 1 means an asset moves with the market (S&amp;P 500 index typically), while a beta of less than 1 means it's ""less volatile"" and a beta higher than 1 means it's ""more volatile."" However, over on r/algotrading, they talk about how beta near 0 for a profitable algorithm generally means that you've discovered a source of alpha, meaning you're profiting not because of market movements but irrespective of them - you've found an edge over the market essentially.

&amp;#x200B;

But those two descriptions don't make sense together. If your strategy has a beta of near zero, one description says that means it's much less volatile than the market, while the other description implies that it doesn't move in the same direction or manner as the market. These sound similar but they aren't the same thing.

The ruling threatens to undermine the very credibility of Central Bank independence, which has always been predicated on a political consensus about what the proper role of monetary policy is, how it should operate, and what its objectives should be.

Last Sunday, Jerome Powell said the central bank still has plenty of ammunition to help the markets and economy. Then, Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) announced positive data on their COVID vaccine on Monday morning. This combination of news drove the S&amp;P 500 increase by 3.2% over the course of the week. With all this good news, can we expect more? Here are the details:

1. **On Sunday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the Fed is not out of ammunition 'by a long shot', driving premarket trading.** Last Sunday, on ""60 Minutes,"" Jerome Powell told the interviewer that ""we're not out of ammunition by a long shot,"" referring to a large sum of unused funds that have been allotted to fight COVID. Simply put, Powell plans on continuously infusing money into the economy to attempt to save small business from closing and permanently reducing the number of jobs available. Index futures traded significantly higher the same night.  
2. **The next morning, Moderna released positive interim P1 data for their COVID vaccine, pushing stocks further upwards.** The morning after, Moderna announced positive data on their COVID vaccine. The biotech company demonstrated generation of anti-COVID antibodies in patients without significant side effects. The company plans on starting their pivotal P3 clinical trial in July, which, if successful, will lead to a much faster economic recovery with everyone's concerns of infection put at ease.
3. **On Thursday, over 2M Americans filed unemployment claims, but investors remain optimistic over economic reopening.** As usual, the announcement of an additional 2.4M Americans filing for unemployment claims did not shake the market. Through our small sample size of consumer research, we have found that many are not working because of high unemployment benefits during COVID. Restaurants are worried about reopening because there may not be enough supply of workers to hire from in order to reopen their shops successfully. While more continue to file for unemployment claims, investors are confident that many will be able to sustain on government support and will reengage with the economy as it reopens. 
4. **To date, all but three states have either reopened to a degree or plan on reopening soon.** The final three states that have yet to open and do not have set plans to open are Illinois, Delaware, and New Jersey. As the weather gets better, more people are out and about waiting for takeout at their favorite local restaurants and eating the food in grassy public areas. So far, the U.S. government has not identified any spikes in COVID cases in states that have reopened. 
5. **With states reopening and the weather improving, airport travel jumps to a two-month high, indicating economic activity.** With summer around the corner and COVID concern dying down, travelers are getting back into the air. This Friday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recorded a two-month high in airport travelers. While this number is still down 88% from a year ago, increase in air travel demonstrates confidence in ability to combat COVID.

**With the Feds' confidence in the economy and Moderna's exciting vaccine announcement, where does that leave the markets?** WX Capital was confident that positive news would outweigh negative news in May, but now that positive news is relatively commonplace, we believe the market may recover at a much slower pace. We expect a successful economic reopening with limited spikes in COVID cases and believe that vaccine development for COVID is more of a matter of when rather than if. We also believe that biotech will likely be the industry with the greatest return potential in the near future.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,419911,public,confidence,self,5/25/2020: Weekly Wrap-up &amp; What to Expect,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gqchri/5252020_weekly_wrapup_what_to_expect/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been following the market more closely since the coronavirus crisis began. Like some people here, the current bull market / bear market rally has been puzzling me because of the state of the economy and of how long this is going to last. It has been said time and again that the market is not the economy, and that is true, as the market is, among other things, a gauge of investor sentiment. And the sentiment for tech stocks it's as high as it's been.

At the time of writing, NASDAQ is up 4% for the year. From my understanding, this is due to the confidence in the biotech sector and, of course, tech stocks. Focusing on tech stocks in general, it looks like people are betting on huge gains on those. And I think there's a point in that tech will benefit from this in a way. But I'm bearish about it, and here's why:

* **Ad revenue:** some of the biggest players heavily rely on ad revenue for profiting. It's understood that many businesses will cut on advertising. Google has said that it will affect their bottom line, expect Facebook to follow suit
* **Consumer spending:** because of the current situation, I expect smartphone sales to take a hit. For many companies (e.g. Apple) this is a main stream of revenue and, although I expect to see a consumption increase in laptop, tablet, and other accessories (e.g. webcams, headsets) I don't see the latter offsetting losses in the former
* **Mobility:** decreased usage of mobility services (e.g. Uber, Lyft, car-sharing apps), if even because of less tourists and air traffic
* **Travel:** even if travel goes back up a bit, it won't go back to 2019 levels (e.g. Airbnb, Booking)
* **Work-From-Home:** here I do believe that tech companies will come out on top, but I'm cautious about it because many companies had already purchased the tools for this (therefore not resulting in a significantly larger pool of customers)
* **Earnings:** a lot of companies removed guidance for the current quarter, which makes it a lot harder to know what to expect (not really bearish, but a factor to keep in mind)
* **Stimulus:** this is what I'm most unsure about. From what I read, the FED has a huge bond-purchasing programme. With this, the FED wants to keep confidence in the markets. My question is, because of the huge debt that the FED already has, and to how large the bond market is ($80 trillion) in comparison with the FED programmes, how much difference will it make?

A Canadian softwate company that is the leader in Enterprise Information Management (EIM), which means they help companies work more efficiently on things like the cloud and within their own systems. Their 2019 1.42 billion doller acquisition of Boston based software company Carbonite, who focused mainly on providing software backups and data protection, also gives them more strings to their bow in the ever growing cloud industry.

They have around 684 companies that use their software, some of the biggest companies are: Aegon, BMW, British American Tobacco, T-Mobile, Fox, Michelin, Qualcomm, Rio Tinto and Unilever. With more and more companies placing emphasis on online work and the importance of the cloud, OpenText is well situated to profit from these trend in the coming decade.

Second company:
TakeTwo Entertainment (TTWO)
Market cap: 15.95 billion
Current share price: 140.51 USD
Year high: 140.51 USD
Foreward PE: 32.38
Total cash: 2 billion
Total debt: 177.25 million
Estimated growth next year: -7.90% but with a 5 year estimate of 11.88% per annum
Estimated sales growth: -5.10%
 
One of the largest video game companies in the world and holder of titles like GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Bioshock, Borderlands, Civilization and NBA2K. These blockbuster gaming franchises make them the producers of the most popular video games in several of the gaming genres. They also recently signed a deal with the NBA to extend their popular 2K series, which also grants them the rights to the ever growing popularity of e-sports focused on NBA2K.

In the recent year they have also shifted their focus more towards the mobile gaming industry, an industry responsible for 60% of the global video game market in 2019 and forecast to grow much more in the coming years. With the video game market as a whole growing and more and more people using their spare time to play video games, TakeTwo is well positioned for the future growth that comes with the industry, especially as games get more realistic and virtual reality starts playing a big role in these games.

Third company:
Blackberry (BB)
Market cap: 2.54 billion
Current share price: 4.54 USD
Year high: 8.96 USD
Foreward PE: 28.38
Total cash: 909 million
Total debt: 758 million
Estimated growth next year: 166.70%
Estimated sales growth: 10.70%

Last but not least, the company that everyone still associates with their popular cellphones in the 2010's. Blackberry has fallen a long way since then, but they have since shifted their focus to software rather than hardware. Since CEO John Chen took over at the helm in 2013, he has drastically changed the future outlook of this company. Blackberry is now mainly focused on cyber security, with their QNX embedded systems software platform being their main flagship for future growth. The QNX platform is used to secure and aid self driving car systems. This platform has helped them land a collaboration deal with Amazon Web Services to produce save self driving cars. It doesn't stop there however, as they also have deals to provide security software for Microsoft, Audi, BMW, Ford, GM and the US government.

It certainly doesn't help that most people still think Blackberry is focused on producing cellphones and I have even heard people asking if they still exist as a company, but they most certainly do and I would argue they are ready for a shot to reclaim their 2010 glory days as a cyber security company instead of a hardware one.

The main point of this plot, I feel, should be to gauge how well your investments have done all-time.  Bank deposits and withdrawals should not be considered. 

For example, say I bought shares of BA, DISNEY, RTX. The plot graph should change each day based on the collective net profit / loss. Then having filters like “daily”, “weekly”, “1 month”, “1 year” , “all-time” can measure your profits / losses over that period of time. And yes I know that it lists the total gain next to each position. Sometimes it’s nice to visualize things especially when you’re tracking progress over time. 

I started initially using Robinhood. After dealing with their unreliable servers and terrible customer service, I moved over all new trading to TDA. Although I’ll admit, I do use RH to look at stocks that I’m watching and pull the trigger on TDA.

RH does have this graph and that is where I first saw it and saw first hand how useful it is. Please see below links. 

Also, I have shamelessly added my current positions. Feel free to comment and give advice. I started learning about the stock market this past April almost been a little over a month.

Tomorrow evening I'll be getting back to live streaming for /r/StockMarket for the first time in a couple months and our trusty band of Discord hooligans has voted to do a stream on **how to identify short term tops and bottoms in fast moving/volatile stocks**!

As a full time trader I spent a number of years short selling high-flying biotech stocks as well as catching falling knives (sometimes badly) and learned (sometimes the hard way) how to tell when a euphoric rally or panic-induced selloff was losing steam and a reversal was imminent. Of course no one can time the market perfectly, but by paying attention to the right details we can drastically improve the timing of our entries and exits, especially for short term trading. In this stream I'll share my experiences, the details I pay attention to and some of the ways I manage risk when dealing with fast moving and volatile stocks that have the potential to wipe you out if you're wrong.

If you can't make it, the stream will be recorded and the link to the recorded session shared in the Discord after it's uploaded.

On Monday, stock futures soared on news of positive early data for Moderna's experimental coronavirus vaccine. And while, understandably, investors and the public are looking for even the smallest glimmer of good news these days, there are still plenty of questions to be answered about Moderna's vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273.

For one thing, we haven't seen a full dataset yet. Moderna's announcement came via a press release saying that all 45 of its trial participants developed coronavirus antibodies after receiving various doses of mRNA-1273. This is what's called interim data—shorthand for ""more data still need to come in""—from a subset of study participants in a phase one trial.

That's not to say it isn't a positive development. And Moderna chairman Noubar Afeyan has insisted that the company would not make any data claims that diverge from reality. It will just take more time and larger future trials before we get a better picture of what's happening with this vaccine.

One of the larger questions about, not just Moderna's experimental vaccine, but *any* coronavirus vaccine candidate, is what the production of antibodies actually means for long-lasting immunity, and how strong that immunity will be. That will take months or even years to determine. For instance, is there a moderate rate of re-infection for patients who have recovered?

We'll find out over the next year, and clearly everyone wants to see a vaccine work. But it's going to take time to figure it out.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,418658,public,confidence,self,Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine expectations game,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gp6heg/modernas_coronavirus_vaccine_expectations_game/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moderna Inc. got a new Wall Street-high price target from Goldman Sachs as its shares traded at a record after the biotech company revealed positive early results from its experimental vaccine for Covid-19.

An initial look at mRNA-1273, as the inoculation is known, “hits the mark,” analyst Salveen Richter said, raising her price target to $105 from $63, or 27% above the prior Street high of $83. Richter rates Moderna a buy. Piper Sandler analysts soon followed raising their price target to $102 from $57 saying Moderna could have “potential blockbuster vaccine sales next year.”

The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index rose as much as 2.8% and is on track to close at a record high after Moderna’s test results. Moderna shares rose as much as 30%. The entire U.S. stock market rose as the first look at a potential vaccine for the disease responsible for the pandemic kindles hope for an end to the shutdowns hobbling economic growth across the globe.

Investors are excited “the vaccine was able to elicit an antibody response at just two weeks post-dose,” Richter wrote in a client note. She was also positive on the activity seen in lower doses, which should bode well for Moderna’s ability to extend its capacity to provide more vaccine. Moderna is now seen having a 75% chance of success, whereas Goldman had previously modelled 70% odds.

Goldman was the lead manager on Moderna’s most recent stock offering in mid-February, which raised cash at $19 a share. The stock has surged nearly four-fold since then. Only one of 12 analysts tracked by Bloomberg rates Moderna a hold, while the rest rate it the equivalent of a buy.

Piper Sandler’s Edward Tenthoff said mRNA-1273 could be a $10 billion a year drug if approved. Former GlaxoSmithKline Plc executive Moncef Slaoui, who is set to become the chief scientist for Operation Warp Speed and is on Moderna’s board, has said that getting a vaccine by January is a “credible objective.”",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,418657,public,confidence,self,Moderna Vaccine ‘Hits the Mark’ as Street Sees a Blockbuster,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gp6ee0/moderna_vaccine_hits_the_mark_as_street_sees_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**The company says study volunteers given a low or medium dose of the vaccine wound up with antibodies similar to those in people who have recovered from COVID-19.**

 

An experimental vaccine against the coronavirus showed encouraging results in very early testing, triggering hoped-for immune responses in eight healthy, middle-aged volunteers, its maker announced Monday.

Study volunteers given either a low or medium dose of the vaccine by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. had antibodies similar to those seen in people who have recovered from COVID-19.

In the next phase of the study, led by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, researchers will try to determine which dose is best for a definitive experiment that they aim to start in July.

In all, 45 people have received one or two shots of the vaccine, which was being tested at three different doses. The kind of detailed antibody results needed to assess responses is only available on eight volunteers so far.

The vaccine seems safe, the company said, but much more extensive testing is needed to see if it remains so. A high dose version is being dropped after spurring some short-term side effects.

&amp;#x200B;

The results have not been published and are only from the first of three stages of testing that vaccines and drugs normally undergo. U.S. government officials have launched a project called “Operation Warp Speed” to develop a vaccine and hopefully have 300 million doses by January.

Worldwide, about a dozen vaccine candidates are in the first stages of testing or nearing it. Health officials have said that if all goes well, studies of a potential vaccine might wrap up by very late this year or early next year.

More than 4.7 million infections and 315,000 deaths from the coronavirus have been confirmed worldwide since it emerged in China late last year.

# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April’s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.
*****
&gt; “The backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “It’s going to be terrible, and that’s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It’s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.” Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.
*****
&gt; April’s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company’s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.
*****
&gt; Astra Zeneca’s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.
*****
&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.
*****
&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.
*****
&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there’s another spike in infections.
*****
&gt; “People are still scared,” he said. “It’s the personal behavior that’s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We’ll get back to some semblance of normal. It’s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.”
*****
&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.
*****
&gt; “By the end of the year, if we don’t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I’m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges

&gt; # Equities

&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.

&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Near-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.”

&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.

# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom

&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.

&gt; ”The monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession’s official start,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today’s LEI number largely confirms April’s strong moves in the equity markets.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.

&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.

# What Happens When The Bear Ends?

&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.

&gt; “In 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.

# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average

&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.

&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking ""beat rates"" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main ""beat rate"" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.

&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our ""Earnings Explorer"" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.

&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**

&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.

&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a ""glass half full"" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.

# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In election years since 1950, June’s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.

A move above or below a 200-day moving average — a proxy for changes  in an asset’s long-term trend — is always closely watched by traders,  but the S&amp;P 500’s long courtship with that key level, as it bounces  back from its bear-market plunge, is becoming something of a fixation on  Wall Street.

But even if stocks do make it back above the 200-day, history  indicates that an extended run to the upside is far from guaranteed.

&gt; **‘A breakout is not likely to come easily and we expect a dogfight here around the 200-day.’**                  
&gt;  
&gt;**— Kevin Dempter, analyst at Renaissance Macro Research**    

The focus on the 200-day might be enhanced by the fact that the  average stood Friday at 2,999.67, just a whisker below a big round  number.

“The fact that the S&amp;P 500 is coming off a 35% rally and  that this 200-DMA lines up with a nice even 3,000 number seemingly makes  this area especially important,” said Kevin Dempter, analyst at  Renaissance Macro Research, in a Friday note. “A breakout is not likely  to come easily and we expect a dogfight here around the 200-day.”

Will we have a “second wave” — or catch a “second wind”? asks Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, in a monthly outlook.

A second wave wouldn’t just involve a recurrence of COVID-19 cases. It might also include a return of [U.S.-China trade tensions](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-fall-ahead-of-memorial-day-weekend-as-investors-watch-china-us-tensions-2020-05-21?mod=article_inline) — and U.S. equity [valuations that are already relatively rich](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-stock-market-is-pricier-than-its-been-since-the-dot-com-bubble-even-as-earnings-forecasts-continue-to-plunge-2020-05-06?mod=article_inline), even after the massive sell-off in March. Markets have been range-bound, waiting for more clarity on what Haefele thinks is the key question: whether virus infections will flare up again.

Still, investors have to plan, and Haefele lays out three possible scenarios along with investment ideas for each.

**Upside Scenario:** In this outlook, lockdown measures are eased throughout May and June, and do not need to be reimposed later. “In this case, we would expect some of the market segments that have underperformed, including cyclicals and value, to begin to outperform.”

That outperformance won’t be across the board, Haefele stresses. In Europe, he suggests investors look to German and EMU industrials, and in the U.S., to mid-cap stocks, particularly those that benefit from a rebound in household consumption.

While it’s natural to expect the value style to be in favor if the economic cycle gets a second wind, the best way to play that will likely be in U.S. energy stocks and U.K. equities, Haefele says. Since the U.S. dollar would likely depreciate in this scenario, the best currency bet versus the dollar [**DXY,** **+0.40%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DXY?mod=MW_story_quote) would likely be the British pound.

The multi-year deal is reportedly worth more than $100 million.

Within just 48 hours of the announcement, [Spotify's market cap increased by nearly $4 billion](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotifys-market-cap-value-soars-by-nearly-4bn-in-wake-of-landmark-joe-rogan-podcast-deal/), to it's highest point in nearly two years.

At the time of the announcement, Spotify's share price was around $169, with a market cap around $31BN. As of yesterday, their share price hit an all time high of over $195, with a market cap around $36BN.

Clearly, this is a big coup for Spotify, who have nabbed the biggest name in the podcast world and one of the biggest stars on YouTube.

His podcast is the number one podcast in the world and gets as many as 190 million downloads per month. In fact, he was [Forbes highest-paid podcaster of 2019, raking in $30 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/02/03/crime-does-pay-my-favorite-murder-stars-join-joe-rogan-as-highest-earning-podcasters/#177986913773).

Of course, this had led to a discussion about the value of content, specifically the value assigned to music and longer form content like Rogan's podcast.

According to music writer [Ted Gioia, a musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights](https://twitter.com/tedgioia/status/1262930316253110276).

It is important to understand the context here:

**For every dollar in revenue the Spotify earns, it sends 65 cents straight to the record industry.**

**This caps Spotify's earnings potential, and means that it has a less robust business model than Netflix.**

**For example, if Netflix pays, say, $30 million to make a new season of Ozark, that cost doesn't increase if it attracts more eyeballs. Media Rights Capital, which produces the show, makes the same money from Netflix regardless of whether the audience is 5,000 or 5 million.**

**However, that is not the case with Spotify: costs** ***rise*** **with subscribers.**

**Every stream will see another slice of the listener's monthly subscription fee go to the record label.**

Spotify has a gross margin of around 25%, whereas Netflix has a gross margin of around 38%.

Spotify has recently spent more than $600 million acquiring four podcasting firms, [including the $250 million acquisition of Ringer earlier this year.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-11/spotify-said-to-pay-250-million-for-ringer-in-podcasting-drive)

Therefore, for a capped cost, Spotify can attract new listeners and potential subscribers. Also, the more time listeners spend on podcasts, the less money Spotify gives to the record labels.

[The deal has raised comparisons with Howard Stern](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/05/19/the-new-howard-stern-podcast-giant-joe-rogan-inks-exclusive-deal-with-spotify/) and SiriusXM, which has made Stern a fortune.

[In 2019 alone, Stern took home an estimated $93 million.](https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-stern/#5bedd7033dc7)

If video killed the radio star, did Spotify just kill the YouTube star?

Or is this a smart move on Rogan's part?

After all, it is expected that some clips will remain on YouTube for the casual algorithm viewers.

Rogan has previously been [critical of YouTube's demonetisation policy and censorship on the platform](https://reclaimthenet.org/joe-rogan-youtube-demonetization-policies/).

Overall, Rogan is banking a guaranteed $100 million in an [uncertain economic environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU).

Although some have commented that he is sacrificing the scale provided by YouTube, he may well still have his clips channel on YouTube.

As well as this, he is *licensing* his podcast.

Therefore, if it fails, he has pocketed $100 million and can return to other platforms, thus generating more press.

If it succeeds, he has pocketed $100 million and will have more leverage in the next contract negotiations.

Now that's a win-win.

What are your thoughts on the move?

International markets have posted 2 red days in a row as the US ratchets up tensions with China.

The Trump administration and the GOP have criticized China's handling of the coronavirus.

Beijing passed laws restricting freedoms in Hong Kong. This flies in the face of the long US-supported one country, two systems policy. New protests are expected.

The GOP led US Senate passed a bill yesterday to delist all Chinese companies from US stock exchanges. This could limit China's ability to raise money.

Futures just went green after a big dip in the red, likely to open flat. We appear to be dealing with some resistance going into the long weekend.

* **If Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine proves to work, the company anticipates working “very closely” with the U.S. government to determine who will get the first doses, CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Friday.** 
* **The company announced Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration cleared its potential vaccine for a phase 2 trial.**

If Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine proves to work, the company anticipates working “very closely” with the U.S. government to determine who will get the first doses, CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Friday. 

The company announced Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration cleared its potential vaccine for a phase 2 trial, what the company called a “crucial step.” Moderna is ramping up its manufacturing capacity so it can rapidly distribute doses if the vaccine proves effective against the virus and safe for humans.

Even so, the company won’t immediately have enough for everyone, Bancel said.

“We will all be supply-constrained for quite some time, meaning we won’t be able to make as many products as will be required to vaccinate everyone on the planet,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

Last week, Moderna announced a 10-year partnership with Swiss drugmaker Lonza to accelerate the production of the experimental vaccine. Bancel told CNBC at the time that the company hopes to begin manufacturing its potential vaccine “as early as July.”

He added that with the partnership, the company hopes to be able to manufacture about 1 billion doses per year. There are more than 7.6 billion people on the planet, according to the U.S. Census’ world population clock.

Bancel said Friday that the company will collaborate with the U.S. government to determine who receives the first doses.

“In the case of the U.S., we anticipate working very closely with the government and with key medical officials to decide who gets the vaccine in the first batch. And then when you have the next batch to ship to the government, how do we allocate it between health-care workers, people who are high risk and different geographies where you have more cases,” he said.

BARDA, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, last month awarded Moderna up to $483 million in funding to accelerate the development of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate.

The potential vaccine, which was developed by researchers at Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, became the first candidate to enter a phase 1 human trial in March\*\*.\*\* The company has not published the results of the phase 1 trial yet but received federal approval to start a larger phase 2 trial soon. Bancel said the phase 3 trial will hopefully begin in the early summer.

The vaccine candidate uses synthetic messenger RNA to inoculate against the virus. Such treatments help the body immunize against a virus and can potentially be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines.

The race to develop a vaccine is intensely competitive and investors are watching closely for signs of progress on treatments and vaccines. Bancel said it will take more than one company to beat back the coronavirus, which has infected more than 3.8 million people around the world and killed at least 270,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

* **If Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine proves to work, the company anticipates working “very closely” with the U.S. government to determine who will get the first doses, CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Friday.**

If Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine proves to work, the company anticipates working “very closely” with the U.S. government to determine who will get the first doses, CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Friday. 

The company announced Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration cleared its potential vaccine for a phase 2 trial, what the company called a “crucial step.” Moderna is ramping up its manufacturing capacity so it can rapidly distribute doses if the vaccine proves effective against the virus and safe for humans.

Even so, the company won’t immediately have enough for everyone, Bancel said.

“We will all be supply-constrained for quite some time, meaning we won’t be able to make as many products as will be required to vaccinate everyone on the planet,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

Last week, Moderna announced a 10-year partnership with Swiss drugmaker Lonza to accelerate the production of the experimental vaccine. Bancel told CNBC at the time that the company hopes to begin manufacturing its potential vaccine “as early as July.”

He added that with the partnership, the company hopes to be able to manufacture about 1 billion doses per year. There are more than 7.6 billion people on the planet, according to the U.S. Census’ world population clock.

Bancel said Friday that the company will collaborate with the U.S. government to determine who receives the first doses.

“In the case of the U.S., we anticipate working very closely with the government and with key medical officials to decide who gets the vaccine in the first batch. And then when you have the next batch to ship to the government, how do we allocate it between health-care workers, people who are high risk and different geographies where you have more cases,” he said.

BARDA, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, last month awarded Moderna up to $483 million in funding to accelerate the development of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate.

The potential vaccine, which was developed by researchers at Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, became the first candidate to enter a phase 1 human trial in March\*\*.\*\* The company has not published the results of the phase 1 trial yet but received federal approval to start a larger phase 2 trial soon. Bancel said the phase 3 trial will hopefully begin in the early summer.

The vaccine candidate uses synthetic messenger RNA to inoculate against the virus. Such treatments help the body immunize against a virus and can potentially be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines.

The race to develop a vaccine is intensely competitive and investors are watching closely for signs of progress on treatments and vaccines. Bancel said it will take more than one company to beat back the coronavirus, which has infected more than 3.8 million people around the world and killed at least 270,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The ECB minutes from the April’s policy meeting are due today, with traders waiting more details on why the central bank decided to keep its main tools unchanged in April even as it pledged to inject more liquidity through its newly-introduced pandemic emergency bond purchase program and adjust its composition as much as it is needed.  Hence, any strong comment that reflects a muddy outlook on the EU economy and flags more QE increases in the future could pressure the Euro, whereas a softer language may reduce the risk of additional stimulus actions, raising demand for the currency.

**SENTIMENT**

BA &amp; TRV Help a Weak DJIA
 
10 of 11 S&amp;P Sectors Lower
 
 
Today’s market was weaker than it looked with 24 of the 30 DJIA stocks lower and 10 of 11 S&amp;P sectors following suit.  The indexes were a split with the DJIA -101.78 (.41%), held up by BA and TRV, while NASDAQ was -90.90 (.97%), S&amp;P-500 -23.10 (.78%).  The Russell was -.63 and the Transports were -36 (.43%).  Market internals were even on the NYSE while NASDAQ was 3:2 lower and volume was lighter.  Tomorrow ought to be a somewhat quiet afternoon ahead of the 3-day weekend, but with everyone already at home or in vacation homes, who knows, might even be busier since no one has to beat the traffic.

SECTORS: The news was negative from the start with the “Tweeter-in-chief” ramping up his anti-China, reelection-based rhetoric and followed by some pretty unpleasant numbers on initial filings for unemployment (2,438,000 v. 2.4million expected) and this week’s “continuing claims” of 25,073,000.  After that we had “existing” home sales -17.8% to an annual run-rate of 4.3 million units.  That was the lowest number since July 2010.  Next came the earnings for TJX, not terrible and looking forward to re-opening and the massive amount of unsold inventory coming their way.  The stock finished $54.30 +3.45 (6.8%) and up from $42.52 earlier this month.  BJs Wholesale (BJ) blew away the numbers and was rewarded with a $6.28 (22%) move up.  BestBuy (BBUY) beat but fell 3.56 (4.4%).  After the close we had Palo Alto Networks crushed their numbers and the stock, already up from $125.47 in early March closed $229.50 -4.98 (2.12% and traded up to $247.81 and finished the evening session $245.51 +16.01 (7%).  Nvidia (NVDA) was the surprise of the afternoon beating both EPS and revenues but after trading +7 and -7 finished $349.50 -2.00.
 
 
FOOD SUPPLY: was LOWER with TSN -.70, BGS -.20, FLO -.05, CAG -.45, MDLZ -.47, KHC -.57, CALM +.13, JJSF -3.03, SAFM -1.10, LANC -2.18, GO -.26, and PBJ $30.56 +.39 (1.24%).
 
 
BIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -4.64, ABBV +1.81, REGN -15.91, ISRG -6.36, GILD -.44, MYL -.35, TEVA +.06, VRTX +.38, BHC -.03, INCY +.36, ICPT -.35, LABU -.79 and IBB $132.03 -1.88 (1.40%).
 
CANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +2.30 (28.57%), CGC +1.64, CRON +1.01, GWPH +.34, ACB +4.26 (33.41%), PYX +.18, NBEV +.06, CURLF +.19, KERN -.07 and MJ $13.80 +1.10 (8.66%).

 
DEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +6.38, GD +2.01, TXT +.14, NOC +5.70, BWXT +.15, TDY +6.22, RTX +2.30, and ITA $153.34 +3.27 (2.18%).
 
 
RETAIL was HIGHER with M +.36, JWN +1.06, KSS +1.30, DDS +1.29, WMT -.08, TGT -.63, TJX +3.74, RL +3.22, UAA +.54, LULU +10.50, TPR +.98, CPRI +1.08, and XRT $39.02 +.78 (2.04%).
 
 
FAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -2.53, AMZN -46.14, AAPL -1.23, FB +3.22, NFLX -10.92, NVDA -9.78, TSLA 9.94, BABA -3.39, BIDU +2.58, CMG -1.04, CAT -1.49, BA +6.80, DIS -1.73 and XLK $96.14 -1.36 (1.39%).
 
 
FINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -1.24, JPM -.93, BAC +.11, MS -.61, C -.25, PNC -.98, AIG +.86, TRV +2.88, AXP -.36, V -2.36 and XLF $22.00 -.07 (.32%).
 
 
OIL, $33.92 + .43. Oil was higher today with the close mid-range.  I thought that the most recent downside break occurred from just under $29.00 and may stop this move too, but as we saw, it went right through that level.  On today’s rally we bought the USU 6/5 25 puts @ $ .91 and they closed $1.01. The stocks on my list were mostly lower with XLE $38.72 -.63 (1.6%).
 
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,721.90 -30.20. After trying to break to new highs Gold failed to follow-thru and opened slightly lower and fell all the way back to trade $1,715.  There is good support from here to $1,685 and I’d expect a renewed move higher.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $9,075 - 495. After breaking down from just over 10,000 and trading 8,220 we started back up and traded all the way back, it failed to make a new recovery high.  We broke all the way back to trade 8815 today but managed a move to close just over $9000.  We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $1110.58 -.64 today.
 
 
Tomorrow is another day.

What a tragic day it's been, after only trading for a few months. Let me start this by saying my emotions got the best of me, and it really hurt. I wasn't ready or expecting to take the loss I did, but I did learn a lot about myself in such a short period of time. Let's go over the trade today:

I am subscribed to warrior tradings chatroom. He's been amazing at giving his mindset, and helping people like me emulate a winning mindset. So today he was watching XTNT, a running stock. In case you don't know, he calls everything out live in his room. I put typed in XTNT and saw it at 2.80. Then I hear him call out that he's gotten long in a position. Seeing how there were many stocks that ran in the past week, this seemed like another. So I didn't want to miss the next big runner. As usual, I was slow to place my orders in. I ended up getting filled at 2.93, and added again at 3. Then a nightmare happened, went into a bad halt. Now at this point, warrior said he was ready to bail. I was in my position full size, and stuck down 80 cents with a 3.10 average long. Then, next thing I know the stock doesn't bounce and warriors out of his position. Unfortunately, my emotions got the best of me, and I held on. It held 2.40 well, and I was thinking it was going to squeeze all the way to about 3 for a nice gain, but it didn't. It broke 2.40, and snapped all the way to 2.00, where I covered at 2.01 for a blow up loss. My emotions got the best of me and I was greedy when I should've taken it off at $3 when warrior said it was holding. Instead, I held and held, until it was over.

This experience has been extremely important as a learning and educational experience. I'm going to come back stronger, and not let my emotions get the best of me. Next month I'll be coming back in pursuit of becoming a top 5% trader, funding my account, and re-subscribe to get a better education.

The company IPO’ed in 2015 and is led by a highly-respected group of scientists and researchers with a strong track record of successfully developing and commercializing precision oncology medicines. Kura’s primary asset, tipifarnib, has shown impressive data that could help it become the first drug approved for the treatment of HRAS-mutated cancers, providing a line of sight to $500M in peak sales over time. We believe this would support a valuation of $20-25/share over the next year (vs. $16/share today) without even accounting for value from Kura’s earlier stage pipeline. 

**Key Takeaways**

* Kura is currently enrolling its registrational AIM-HN trial that could read out as early as October 2020, and based on tipifarnib’s Phase 2 data, we believe that there is a **strong likelihood of a successful readout**. Kura is developing tipifarnib, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, for HRAS-mutated cancers, starting with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 
* Tipifarnib could achieve **\~$500M in peak sales** in HRASm HNSCC alone, with the opportunity to expand into larger HRAS indications as well as earlier lines of treatment through combination therapies. 
* Using a peak sales multiple of 2.5-3x and POS of 75% for tipifarnib, we arrive at a **probability-adjusted value of $20-25/share** based on tipifarnib alone. When factoring in the additional upside potential of the early stage pipeline, we believe that Kura offers an attractive risk-reward from \~$16/share today. We will be initiating a position in Kura, targeting a 6% weight. 

**Key Stock Drivers**

* **Unique asset with scientifically-sound mechanism of action.** HRAS is a gene that, when mutated, produces a defective HRas protein that activates a signaling cascade that has been identified as a central contributor to tumor growth and proliferation. The HRas protein can only activate its signaling pathway by binding to the cell membrane through a process called farnesylation (basically adding a special protein group to HRas). Tipifarnib, Kura’s drug, is a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) that prevents the farnesylation process and thus prevents HRas signaling. While this may sound simple, Kura is currently the only company in the clinic with an FTI and could be the first to market with a drug for HRAS-mutant cancers. 
* **Initial patient population with high unmet need.** HNSCC is the 6th largest cancer indication worldwide, with 60,000 new patients in the US annually. Of these cases, 5-8% (\~3,000 patients) have an HRAS mutation. The prognosis for these patients using standard immunotherapy and chemo is extremely poor, with an average 15-35% objective response rate (ORR) and 3 months progression free survival (PFS) across 1st and 2nd line therapy. 
* **De-risked Phase 2 data.** Tipifarnib has already demonstrated strong activity in HRASm HNSCC; in its Phase 2 trial, tipifarnib achieved an ORR of 56% (10/18) and a clinical benefit rate of 100% in advanced recurrent/metastatic HRASm HNSCC patients, and a median PFS of 6.1 months. Given the already poor outcomes of HRASm patients, we believe that the bar for approval is low, with 25% ORR and 6 months PFS being sufficient for approval, which compares favorably to what tipifarnib has already achieved. 
* **$500M Peak Sales Potential.** At peak, assuming 3,000 HRASm HNSCC patients, 50% penetration, average treatment duration of 1 year + 10,000 additional HRAS-eligibile patients, 10% penetration (conservative), and 6 months average treatment duration, and an annual price of $250,000, we arrive at $500M in potential peak sales for tipifarnib in HRAS-mutant cancers. 
* **Experienced, accomplished leadership team.** Kura’s management team boasts stellar track records in drug development and commercialization, achieved over decades of industry experience. CEO Troy Wilson previously led Wellspring Biosciences, a notable private, targeted oncology biotech, as well as Intellikine, which was acquired by Takeda. CCO Kirsten Flowers led the successful launches of Brafktovi/Mektovi at Array Biopharma prior to its $11B acquisition by Pfizer. Other team members boast similarly impressive resumes from their time at companies including Merck and Pfizer, where they held senior leadership positions.  
* **Optionality from early stage pipeline.** Besides HNSCC, tipifarnib is also being evaluated in additional squamous cell carcinomas,  peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML), where it is currently in Phase 2 trials. These opportunities could represent up to 10,000 additional patients eligible for tipifarnib. Kura is also developing KO-539, a menin-MLL inhibitor, for certain types of leukemia, starting with AML. 
* **Upcoming catalysts in 2020/21.** Kura has clear upcoming milestones that we expect will have a large impact on the stock:

1. ***Late 2020/early 2021.*** Potential readout of registrational AIM-HN trial evaluating tipifranib in HRAS-mutant HNSCC. 
2. ***Mid-2020.*** Data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial evaluating tipifarnib in CMML. 
3. ***Year-end 2020.*** Readout of Phase 1 trial evaluating KO-539 in AML and achievement of a recommended Phase 2 dose. 

* **Cash to fund operations into 2022.** Kura ended 1Q20 with $350M in pro-forma cash (includes proceeds from equity issuance in May 2020), which the company expects will fund operations comfortably into 2022. This should provide Kura with ample time to fully enroll the AIM-HN trial barring any extreme delays and support the rest of its clinical programs.
* **Strong IP estate.** Kura has multiple patents that provide tipifarnib exclusivity in HRASm HNSCC until 2036, while protecting other IP including the mechanism of action, use in combination therapy, and dosing/scheduling, etc. 

**Key Stock Risks**

* **Clinical and regulatory failure.** Like most biotechs, Kura’s value would be significantly impaired if tipifarnib were to show worse-than-expected clinical results or severe safety issues. Regulators could also set a higher bar for approval than we are projecting. 
* **Delay of trial timelines.** The biggest near-term risk to Kura is the possibility that the enrollment of the AIM-HN trial is delayed meaningfully past the late 2020/early 2021 target management has guided to. While this would only delay tipifarnib’s data readout, we would expect any material slippage in the trial timeline to have an adverse effect on the stock. 
* **Lower-than-expected HRAS sequencing.** Identifying patients with HRAS-mutant cancers is critical to tipifarnib’s commercial potential. While Kura is working to establish HRAS genetic screening as standard practice, this may be difficult in indications where HRAS mutations are rare (such as HNSCC) and thus limit tipifarnib sales.

[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl464q/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/), I laid the foundation for the ""Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing"" project, where we ignorantly invest in earnings, with well-defined conditions under a well-defined time period, and evaluate the returns. The initial response was great, and I thank all of you for the support. If you haven\'t read the first post, I recommend reviewing it as this post (and future posts) will build off of that foundation.\n\n(As a reminder, this is not investment advice. The results of this research should not be generalized over thousands of weeks of earnings releases. Proceed at your own risk.)\n\nSince my previous post, I\'ve retroactively applied our methodology to the previous 5 weeks of earnings, considered a more conservative investment methodology, and discovered some interesting insights in the process.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst and foremost, backtesting has provided increasing evidence that this methodology is a secure hedge against market downturns. The results from 4/13 to 5/11 are below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Week of 4/13 to 4/17**\n\n|Earnings Return|S&amp;P Return|DOW Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2.30%|3.98%|3.60%|\n||||\n|Outperform (underperform):|\\-1.49%||\n\n\\-The week of 4/13 was made up primarily of financial institutions earnings which may explain the smaller movement.

Companies that would fall under the Graham-Dodd ""value-investment"" definition usually have smaller movements following earnings in both directions. The week of 4/27 demonstrated the necessity of including more speculative earnings plays to outperform the market, as without these plays, our earnings returns would\'ve underperformed.\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IpNM_XrVQOUHNgh8mT4RWTIH_E9V8JYt7jIDvhHrogg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Week of 5/4 to 5/8**\n\n|Earnings Return|S&amp;P Return|DOW Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|3.58%|3.12%|2.56%|\n||||\n|Outperform (underperform):|0.69%||\n\n\\-Earnings were predominantly growth/tech stocks.\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18BF6iiIb13jEjFip3LCso2Y4fS-diga6XSgWY3cg_JM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Week of 5/11 to 5/15**\n\n|Earnings Return|S&amp;P Return|DOW Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2.40%|\\-1.50%|\\-2.30%|\n||||\n|Outperform (underperform):|4.30%||\n\n\\-Earnings were predominantly growth/tech stocks.\n\n\\-This was the greatest earnings performance (versus the market) over the last 5 weeks. Although a preliminary look at earnings returns this week + market performance points to a similar, if not greater earnings outperformance this week.\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tf_sJnfaUoNmYeRnRKtBu2xJuBKio5xzOJV-0d_X5dg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Summary**\n\n||Earnings Return Week to Week|S&amp;P Return Week to Week|DOW Return Week to Week|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|4/13|2.30%|3.98%|3.60%|\n|4/20|0.35%|0.50%|0.50%|\n|4/27|0.01%|\\-1.50%|\\-1.70%|\n|5/4|3.58%|3.12%|2.56%|\n|5/11|2.40%|\\-1.50%|\\-2.30%|\n|||||\n|Total Compounded Return ($100)|$108.89|$104.55|$102.55|\n\n**A few key points:**\n\n\\-Similar to 5/11, each week, there were more negative movements following earnings than positive movements, but on average, the positive movements were greater. This supports the thesis that the upside of a positive earnings response is greater than the downside of a negative earnings response.\n\n\\-Despite the fact the earnings return underperformed the broader market 2 of the 5 weeks (4/13 + 4/20), the earnings returns were never negative (albeit it got close 4/27). This supports the thesis that the optimism surrounding companies\' earnings acts as a hedge against broader market unfavorability.\n\n\\-As was brought to my attention in my last post, because the holding period for each stock is no more than 24 hours, in future posts total earnings returns will need to be discounted for capital gains taxes. This demonstrates the advantage of passive indexing + not having to worry about often turnover. I believe that even considering capital gains, the earnings results of the last 5 weeks will still outperform the broader markets, but we will see in the next post.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Applying Our Methodology to Low-Beta Companies + Going Forward**\n\nThe last few weeks of research have led me to believe that putting together a formal investment vehicle for this methodology, such as an ETF, would be difficult considering the lack of upside potential residing in fundamentally proven companies. ETFs that focus on trading within the S&amp;P or DOW are inherently disadvantaged from a return perspective. But I would argue that under the right portfolio formation (following the diversified earnings schedule we\'ve followed the last 5 weeks), we can sustain an outperformance of the broader market over the long term.\n\nTo demonstrate this, I will apply this methodology to the current 505 companies in the S&amp;P, going from 2008 to 2019. This will be the subject matter of my next post (along with continued backtesting on the ""most anticipated earnings"" investment approach). In anticipation of conducting this research, I chose $WYNN (which has been in the S&amp;P since 2008) to experiment with returns. As the results show (fair warning, this is 1 of 505 companies. extrapolating from this is ignorant on my part), there is legitimacy to the argument that attempting to apply this earnings report methodology to low-beta companies will NOT outperform the market.\n\n**$WYNN Returns (10/29/08 to 5/9/19)**\n\n||Earnings|S&amp;P|DOW|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Return|123.60% (not including capital gains)|213.55%|176.98%|\n|Annualized Return|11.18%|||\n|Average Earnings Movement|1.796%|||\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ikkxjrtz0wXacKfyPvIPcHQ0LihCkJv-nu1Q1s-2Yos/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a preliminary test, this reflects poorly on the potential of applying this methodology to the S&amp;P and DOW. It very well may be that $WYNN is an exception: we will see next week.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, a lot of the information discovered so far is a generous extrapolation. But we are objectively getting closer to clear answers regarding how this methodology may perform over the long-term. Over the next few weeks, we will be working on filling in the S&amp;P\'s returns from \'08 to \'19 using this methodology, along with applying this methodology to ""anticipated earnings releases"" over an extended period of time as we\'ve done for the last five weeks.\n\nAs always, please let me know what you think!', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Playing the Earnings Calendar: An Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing [Pt.2: Multi-Week Returns + Unique Insights]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl464q/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I laid the foundation for the &amp;quot;Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing&amp;quot; project, where we ignorantly invest in earnings, with well-defined conditions under a well-defined time period, and evaluate the returns.

This supports the thesis that the upside of a positive earnings response is greater than the downside of a negative earnings response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Despite the fact the earnings return underperformed the broader market 2 of the 5 weeks (4/13 + 4/20), the earnings returns were never negative (albeit it got close 4/27). This supports the thesis that the optimism surrounding companies&amp;#39; earnings acts as a hedge against broader market unfavorability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-As was brought to my attention in my last post, because the holding period for each stock is no more than 24 hours, in future posts total earnings returns will need to be discounted for capital gains taxes. This demonstrates the advantage of passive indexing + not having to worry about often turnover. I believe that even considering capital gains, the earnings results of the last 5 weeks will still outperform the broader markets, but we will see in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying Our Methodology to Low-Beta Companies + Going Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks of research have led me to believe that putting together a formal investment vehicle for this methodology, such as an ETF, would be difficult considering the lack of upside potential residing in fundamentally proven companies. ETFs that focus on trading within the S&amp;amp;P or DOW are inherently disadvantaged from a return perspective. But I would argue that under the right portfolio formation (following the diversified earnings schedule we&amp;#39;ve followed the last 5 weeks), we can sustain an outperformance of the broader market over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this, I will apply this methodology to the current 505 companies in the S&amp;amp;P, going from 2008 to 2019. This will be the subject matter of my next post (along with continued backtesting on the &amp;quot;most anticipated earnings&amp;quot; investment approach). In anticipation of conducting this research, I chose $WYNN (which has been in the S&amp;amp;P since 2008) to experiment with returns. As the results show (fair warning, this is 1 of 505 companies. extrapolating from this is ignorant on my part), there is legitimacy to the argument that attempting to apply this earnings report methodology to low-beta companies will NOT outperform the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$WYNN Returns (10/29/08 to 5/9/19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Earnings&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;S&amp;amp;P&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;DOW&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Return&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;123.60% (not including capital gains)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;213.55%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;176.98%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Annualized Return&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;11.18%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Average Earnings Movement&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1.796%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ikkxjrtz0wXacKfyPvIPcHQ0LihCkJv-nu1Q1s-2Yos/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a preliminary test, this reflects poorly on the potential of applying this methodology to the S&amp;amp;P and DOW. It very well may be that $WYNN is an exception: we will see next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, a lot of the information discovered so far is a generous extrapolation. But we are objectively getting closer to clear answers regarding how this methodology may perform over the long-term. Over the next few weeks, we will be working on filling in the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s returns from &amp;#39;08 to &amp;#39;19 using this methodology, along with applying this methodology to &amp;quot;anticipated earnings releases&amp;quot; over an extended period of time as we&amp;#39;ve done for the last five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, please let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'wallstreetbets', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2th52', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/wallstreetbets', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1210681, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Playing the Earnings Calendar: An Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing [Pt.2: Multi-Week Returns + Unique Insights]', 'total_awards_received': 1, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 4, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7y81/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",,,,,,,

Exchange-traded funds that track the performance of Chinese companies stumbled Thursday as the ***House of Representatives considers a bill that could ban Chinese firms from listing on U.S. exchanges,*** after a ***similar bill passed the Senate unanimously Wednesday.*** The [Invesco China Technology ETF](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=21977044) (CQQQ) was down 2.7% in early trade Thursday, while shares of Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF (CHIQ) shed 2.3% and [KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=66272067) (KWEB) declined 1.8%. The bill would require that foreign companies let the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board oversee the auditing of their financial records if they want to raise money by selling stocks or bonds to the American public. All U.S. companies and most foreign firms already work with the PCAOB in this way, but Chinese firms do not. Some analysts predicted the bill could be swiftly approved as Congress looks to signal toughness toward China in an election year. Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Wednesday that the administration supports measures to increase oversight of Chinese firms, though the White House hasn't publicly stated an opinion on this particular legislation. Also under pressure were American Depository Receipts of Chinese tech giants Alibaba Holding Group Ltd. (9988.HK) and JD.com (JD). ADRs for Baidu Inc., another Chinese tech firm, Baidu Inc.

Futures are lower after unemployment numbers have been released. No surprises in that number, a couple million more without jobs. So far markets appear unchanged.

Lots of low float stocks in play today. There were lots of halts yesterday so I'll be approaching these with caution.

I'm overall bullish on the day, I see no reason for the rally to fade now.

**Watchlist:**

**LEDS** is a super low float, watching for a setup above $3

**RENN** is another very low float, key level at $3

**ATOS** low float watching for a setup above $2.50

**CIDM** is a low float on watch

**SURF** another low float, watching for a setup above $4

**ALT** is a low float, resistance at $6.50

**EVOK** is a lowish float, support at $1.80

**CLSN** is a lowish float, watching for a setup above $1.80

SPY trying to clear resistance in the form of the 100 + 200 Daily moving averages as the range in individual days decreases, choppy trading action intraday for the past week or so and will likely stay this way util the SPY clears the 200 or gets rejected and then we should see some more volatility come back in to the market. For now, we just have to do our best to navigate around these levels and only trade the best setups, stocks with catalyst preferred.

“We have to for investor protection, and we have to for national security,” Kudlow said. “A lot of these companies, by the way, have already had scandals and cost investors a lot of money, because of their failure to be transparent in their reporting. The Chinese government forbids that kind of transparency.”

*The bill would also need to pass the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives before reaching the president’s desk to be signed into law*. “There is not yet a decision on whether to hold a vote on this legislation in the House, according to our conversations with trade and finance counsel there,” wrote Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy at Veda Partners, in a Tuesday note to clients. “But it is our view that there is bipartisan support for doing so as both Democrats and Republicans look to make their China hawk bonafides known to their constituents.”

Yes, I understand how volatility can destroy the value. Yes, I understand that you are tripling the downsides as well as the upside. Now for the response:

**Stop losses are a thing**

Downturns hurt triple, but only if you’re stupid. If you set tight stop losses you can avoid the worst impacts of a sudden downturn. Trailing stop losses at 15% are reasonable. You may think 15% isn’t that tight, but remember that’s only a 5% decrease in the underlying. Sit out until you are confident things have stabilized and get back in. You’ll make that 15% back in no time. 

**Since volatility is a problem, avoid it**

You may think that avoiding volatility is as impossible as timing the market but it’s not. Not all times are suitable.  If it looks like you’re going to be trading sideways, pull out. But say after a major downturn when you expect things to trend upward over the long-term, it’s not a bad idea to have triple leverage. This isn’t just about timing, it’s also about selecting the ETF in the first place. Don’t buy triple leveraged ETFs in volatile industries unless you’re day trading. Remember that the market as a whole trends upward on the long term. Find underlying ETFs that do the same. Not ones that bounce from chart bottoms to top and back again, and not ones that stay level.

**You can do much better than triple**

Why take the risk at all? Remember that growth compounds. Lets say QQQ gains 0.5% 10 days in a row. Yes, I know that would be unusual but it’s to illustrate a point. After the 10 days, your investment in QQQ is up 5.114%. Not bad. But if you had your money in TQQQ, it would be up 16.0541%. In case you missed it, that’s more than triple. Maybe you think that that effect is too small to be of consequence, but over the past 10 years, QQQ has gained 380.5%. TQQQ has gained 3395.1%. That isn’t triple. That’s nearly 9 times the gains. That more than makes up for fees by the way. See now why I make the argument for triple leveraged ETFs? And that’s if you didn’t trailing stop loss to blunt the effect of the covid downturn. If you had it would be much higher than that.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,416857,public,confidence,self,People are too scared of triple-leveraged ETFs,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gnpo47/people_are_too_scared_of_tripleleveraged_etfs/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That doesn't mean the stock market will also get worse. If the stock market proved anything, it's that stock market is not the economy. However, the stock market growth is done for the foreseeable future and anymore money in the stock market prior to full recovery is just putting water into an overflowing bucket. It's called a bubble.

That's because buying stocks YESTERDAY while the company was down, is to own a share of what the company might be once it's back at 100%. So buying stocks at a dip makes perfect sense - you get to share in that equity at a discount. However, the more stock price goes up, less room there is for new buyers. Stock prices have already recovered. The company's future/prospective valuation has been priced into its stocks now. If you were to pile on already high prices and buy more stocks, you're out of the value zone and into pure bubble zone. Everyone takes some risk, including people who bought at low price in March, hoping that their company will do better in the future. If you buy in TODAY, then you are not buying for when the company recovers, you are betting that it will recover and then some. 

So why put your money in now? There is no more room for you to speculate. Just wait till the company's value catches up to its stock price. You can FOMO then knowing that at least you are putting money into a company whose valuation is real, not speculative. Putting money in an already saturated market before companies actually grow is risky and can cause a big bubble, which in turn puts pressure to sell, piled on by more short sellers, and then dot com bubble v2 happens. 

So don't. Either wait for the market to crash again (may not happen) or just wait till Disney actually becomes Disney that's worth $120 a share.

The S&amp;P500 is only down 12% from its all time high in early 2020 and is greater than its average in 2019. The S&amp;P500 Index closed today at 2,972. In 2019 the S&amp;P500 averaged to be 2,913. In 2018 and 2017 it averaged 2,746 and 2,449, respectively. 

For those bulls who want to buy stocks now, you must have been going crazy buying stocks in 2019 and even crazier in 2018, and 2017. Many people were saying stocks were overvalued (or at least a bit frothy in 2019), but now (going into the most cataclysmic economic event of our lifetimes), it is a good time to buy??

Here is my bearish case for stocks:

* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession  right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.
* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy. 
* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).
* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.
* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.
* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.
* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down. 
* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.

My questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?

The economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just ""I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up"". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a ""forced seller""). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with ""growth potential"" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions. 

I welcome thoughts from Bulls and Bears. I shared my opinion for discussion so I can hear feedback and form a more complete view. I have no interest in calling Bulls stupid.

Hi guys,

Following the [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges) today, 

I did a little bit digging, and there are some quite ridiculous Chinese State-Owned Enterprises and government agencies currently trading on NYSE. 

Apparently, SEC and the regulating bodies in the US cannot check their books because it's considered as ""[State Secret](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/06/china-and-the-u-s-stock-market-nowhere-to-go.html)"" by the Chinese government??

And they got state-owned airlines, telecom, oil, even railroad built with money raised from American investors???

And these Chinese State-Owned Enterprises just come to the US market and raise money and swindle US retail investors out of money??? Something has to be done!

Not sure about NASDAQ, will look more into it this week.

If you have positions in these companies, get out and be careful of other Chinese private companies as well, the Luckin book issue may be just tip of the iceberg. [Alibaba Group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-growth-becomes-a-tougher-sell-on-wall-street-11586426382) can hide the accounting malpractices for now, but in the next 6-12 months with the pandemic and the attention on CCP being responsible? Shit is going to hit the fan for these Chinese companies, and they will run from the NASDAQ and NYSE with American investors' money.

The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam’s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam’s favorite analogy, think of BEAM’s platform as the “pencil and eraser” versus the “scissors” of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam’s pipeline, but with the company’s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.

***We invested in BEAM (\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company’s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***

**Key Takeaways**

* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.
* Current market cap of \~$1.1 B offers \~3x upside by \~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam’s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.
* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. 
* The company’s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.
* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.
* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.
* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\]. Applying Beam’s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam’s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. 
* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).
* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a “wave” of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam’s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren’t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. 
* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.
* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

•What happened?  
—&gt; Nano Dimension (NASDAQ: NNDM) shares rocketed up after releasing news about printing the first 3D 10-layer printed circuit board (PCB) 💻  
\~  
•Why?  
—&gt; This marks the first time electronic structures can be soldered to both outer sides! Before this, 3D printed boards could not handle the soldering process for two-sides components. But now, using newly tested dielectric polymer ink from [\#HENSOLDT](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/hensoldt/) and NNDM’s own conductive ink, the two companies can manufacture incredibly powerful PCB’s at quick speeds  
\~  
•What about now?  
—&gt; Given the cheap price of [\#NNDM](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/nndm/) this jump in price no doubt attracted lots of day traders and beginner investors looking to make a quick gain.

It seems that the stock market hasn't been affected as much as expected and that it is especially sensitive to positive news (e.g. moderna trials, remdesivir, etc.).

Eventually, it will come back down but this though process leads me to believe that a sort of large bubble will occur with the stock market in the coming years.

I’m in Australia and I have the privilege of befriending people two generations older than me that are well versed in trading on the stock market. They have encouraged me to research this because of how successful they are and the fact that I am really keen to understand how it all works.

I have very little money to play with but I do have a lot of time to learn. 

What resources do you recommend for absolute beginners. Bonus points for anything that is especially relevant to Australians. If I can make even just a few grand extra a year, it would mean a great deal.

We could have a vaccine for COVIS-19 widely available as soon as next year. Markets appear to be very optimistic about this news. Markets all surged higher yesterday. Though single day large gains are not typical of bull markets.

Oil has been stabilizing with prices in the $30's. Many oil-related stocks could be in play today.

Futures are a little choppy, basically flat right now. I'm bullish on the day. I will be taking full-size positions.

**Watchlist:**

**OMP** is a low float oil play, resistance ta $8

**EVOK** is a lowish float, resistance at $1.80

**RTLR** oil play with resistance at $8.80

**LPCN** watching for support at $1

**MRNS** has resistance at $3

**VNOM** is an oil play, with resistance at $10

**SLCA** is an oil play, resistance at $2.40

**ADAP** has resistance at $6

**PUMP** is an oil play resistance is at $5

**OII** is an oil play, support is at $5.60

Much of the excitement has centered on Moderna Therapeutics, which had an early prospect [ready for clinical trials just 42 days](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273) after the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus was released. But while public officials and news reports were quick to cite this as a record-breaking development, the biotechnology underlying this drug [has existed for nearly 30 years](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7020037), and it has never yielded a working vaccine for any human disease. (Requests for comment from Moderna Therapeutics have not been answered.)

If the past is any indicator, the world won’t have a coronavirus vaccine for more than a year, probably longer. The mumps vaccine—considered the fastest ever approved—took four years to go from [collecting viral samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/health/maurice-hilleman-mmr-vaccines-forgotten-hero.html) to [licensing a drug in 1967](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#vaccines). Clinical trials come with three phases, and the first stages of the current COVID-19 trials [aren’t due for completion until this fall, spring 2021, or much later](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=vaccine&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search). And there are good reasons to allow time for safety checks. Some preliminary vaccines for the related coronavirus SARS, for instance, [actually enhanced the disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) in model experiments.

“A year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented,” says [Peter Hotez](https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/peter-hotez-m-d-ph-d/b1846a47-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6), dean at Baylor University’s National School of Tropical Medicine. “Maybe with the new technology, maybe with throwing enough money on it, that'll happen.

I have a HYSA.  Earns like $500/year in interest.  So I took 10% and put it into a brokerage account.  I buy $100-$200 in stocks (bought TSLA once) at a time.  So if DIS is a $100/share, I buy 1 or 2.

My goal is to beat my interest in earnings.  So far I have earned $732 in realized. I’m down $180 in unrealized losses.

It’s fun. I watch CNBC and make trades off of common sense.  Like buying home improvement off the bounce. 

My strategy has been to sell a stock if it goes higher than 20% gain, no matter what. 

Big winners for me are TSLA, SPCE, ZM, HD, TDOC, DOCU, PYPL, TEAM, GLD, SHW

Losers are hold until 12/31.

Right now, I’m holding lots of the cyclical value plays: TRIP, H, UAL, Royal Carib

I can't time the market and have no idea exactly when it will come, but believe many stocks are grossly overvalued given the situation. I also believe once it crashes it will take years to get back to current levels. These are my reasons:

* Unemployment and GDP indicate companies will lose lots of $$$ and many will go out of business.
* This is not a typical recession where stimulus spending is putting people back to work (in some cases the opposite is happening where people make more $ staying home and make). Many sectors of the economy (restaurants, airlines, retail) are tough enough to compete in as it is, never-mind when they are shut down (or customers are afraid to go out).
* The reduction in sales/economic economy we are seeing is with stimulus spending. Just wait to it wear off (I do anticipate more but there is a limit as I said before it will not fix the economy and only put a further debt burden on it). 
* When businesses do open there will be capacity and safety restrictions that make opening a business less profitable and more expensive to operate.
* Inflation will (eventually occur) and possibly higher interest rates. Typically it can be very tough for stimulus to cause inflation. However, in this case, there are many aspects which limit production and cause goods to be more expensive which will increase prices. The government will welcome inflation but will have to raise rates eventually to bring it back in line which will damage stock valuations.
* We will eventually have to pay back all the debt which will result in higher taxes.
* The stock market was pricey enough before COVID-19.

Below are my short stock picks and brief rationale why. I'd love to get feedback if anyone agrees or disagrees.

**Name	                 P/E 	               Debt/Capitalization**

Air Lease Corp	              4.39	           72%

Credit Acceptance Corp	9.08	   66%

Hilton Grand Vacations	9.14	   79%

Best Buy	                         13.61	    27%

Callaway	                                  21	      51%

IAA Auto Auctions	             26.24	     108%

Restaurant Brand International  28	      78%

Five Below	                                29	        0

Penn National Gaming	 51	          85.00%

Zillow	                             Negative	    37%

**Credit Acceptance Corp:** This is my #1 Short. I think this company is going to get hammered (fuck this company too as they are predatory lenders). These guys provide auto financing to the worst of the worst (think 25% interest rates and no verification of income). In good times about 30% of their loans go bad. Even if their loans get paid (I don’t think they will), futures sales will be driven down along with auto sales (which will decrease with the weak economy as well as people not needing cars because they are not commuting). 

**Penn**: They own racetracks, casinos and slot machines. They have considerable and a 2019 P/E of 51 (negative TTM P/E for 3/31/2020), and will lose money for 2020 and beyond. I don’t see how anyone thinks this is a good time to invest in a growth, leveraged casino company. 

**Restaurant Brands International**: These guys own Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes. I like Popeyes but that only represents a small fraction of income (under 10% I believe). I like Tim Hortons, but they have no room to grow and will lose with COVID-19 with less people commuting and no need for their morning coffee. I view Burger King as one of the weaker fast food brands.

**Zillow**: Company is not profitable as it is (negative earnings). Less people will be moving with COVID-19. Recession will also result in less advertising. Will take much longer for this company to become profitable. Price will go down. 

**Five Below**: I think the loss in retail sales are really gonna hurt these guys. There is no reason to go to this store if you can get the same stuff delivered to you from Amazon for cheaper.

**Air Lease Corp**: This company will get hurt with the loss of air travel. They lease aircrafts to major airlines. Some of their customers may not even be able to continue paying their lease.

**IAA Auto Auctions**: This company facilitates auto auctions. They have a lot of debt and P/E is up there a bit. This companies holds auto auctions. I think there will be less demand for autos which will affect their revenues. They do get some revenues from auto sellers but most is from the buyer (66% is from the buyer). 

**Genuine Parts Co**: This company Genuine Parts Company distributes automotive replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. With the decline in industry and miles driven, I think they will be negatively affected. 

**Hilton Grand Vacations**: This is a spin off of Hilton that sells time shares. I don’t think now is a time people want to commit to buying a timeshares. Some existing customers may stop paying if they are unable to use their timeshare or unable to afford it. They also have a lot of debt.

**Best Buy**: These guys may do okay (competitors were closed), but if they report bad earnings this week I think they are screwed. Why do we need BestBuy anymore? People can buy lab-tops online and can buy TVs at Target and/or Walmart. I think long-term this is a bad investment and COVID-19 may speed that up.

**Callaway**: I love this company and brand (I use to own this stock), but this is a competitive industry and less discretionary income results in less sales. P/E has been increasing and I think price will adjust.  Is this the year people want to upgrade their golf equipment?

Problem is when the market does not offer many opportunities and just goes up and up and I believe some prices are not fairly reflecting the current business reality. 

A few days ago I came across the PUT selling strategy though, and this seems to fit my long term strategy by either getting a premium if the stock keeps skyrocketing, or increasing my positions at a lower, more acceptable, price.

I have some questions regarding the Interactive Brokers interface though, and understanding all the data that is provided. If I want to sell PUTS for AMCR I can see some strike prices for June 2020 below 8 in Yahoo Finances: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMCR/options?p=AMCR&amp;straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMCR/options?p=AMCR&amp;straddle=true)

However in IBKR that's not the case and the minimum I can go is 8: [https://imgur.com/a/aYtWYTI](https://imgur.com/a/aYtWYTI)

Image 1:

\- Let's say I want a strike of 8 or less: Are there no PUTS I can sell below 8? May these appear as available if somebody decides to take the opposite side (for example during the session)? If the Bid price is 0.05 and the Ask is 0.15, can I set a Limited price of 0.12? Or I can only go for the 0.05 

\- What is the C in front of the price?

Demetri Kofinas speaks with professor of finance at Beijing’s Peking University, Michael Pettis. Profesor Pettis’ research has focused mainly on Chinese financial markets, global trade &amp; capital flows, and central banking. He spent seventeen years on Wall Street running fixed-income trading and capital market desks and has advised governments on privatizations of national banking systems and commercial bank debt restructuring &amp; loan issuance.  

In their latest book, “Trade Wars are Class Wars,” Michael Pettis and his co-author Matthew Klein argue that rising inequality within countries heightens trade conflicts between them.  The entire conversation lasts for approximately two hours and we devote the first hour to understanding how balance of payments and capital flows—themselves heavily dependent on the dynamics of wealth and income distribution within a country’s borders—can generate imbalances in trade, asset prices, interest rates, debt levels, and currency valuations, often leading to misallocations of capital for the surplus and deficit countries alike.    

The second hour is devoted to applying this balance of payments framework to specific economies—namely, the United States, the Eurozone, and China. Demetri and Michael discuss how the financial instability generated from the sorts of imbalances discussed in this episode are now seeping into our systems of government, turning a financial crisis into a political one.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,414591,public,confidence,self,"Michael Pettis: “I would argue that there's two very important fiscal roles.

Here it is:

Last week’s late buyers failed in Monday’s auction at key resistance as rotation lower toward key support developed in Tuesday’s trade.

Buyers trapped there as a breakdown developed to 20.09s in Thursday’s auction.

Buy excess formed there, halting the selloff before a relief rally ensued toward the breakdown area into week’s end.

The highest probability path near-term is for price discovery lower, provided 22.32s holds as resistance.

Trading money is very volatile. Some days you make 10, next day your up 20, third day you are down 50 etc...This is even with swing trading you will lose money on some swings, even options which seem like throwing money in the air predicting the future. This is hit and miss. 

Sure with consistency you will end with profits at the end of the year. The main way the 10% of traders make money is they make some ""trading strategy,"" and end up selling courses on the strategy, and also make a platform where they share trades and people paying monthly subscriptions, make a book and people buy their trading book...etc. I saw that this is consistant and stable income from my day trading friend who is a successful day trader...he simply makes money from the 90% of day traders who pay him for courses, subscriptions, books, classes etc.

I guess what I am trying to say is unless you are like my friend who is dedicating his life to trading and teaching you are better off long term investing, learning a skill which will lead to higher pay and equity and consistent income.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,413857,public,confidence,self,"90% of traders lose money, the 10% make money from the 90%",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gli9yf/90_of_traders_lose_money_the_10_make_money_from/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of this research should not be generalized over thousands of weeks of earnings releases. Proceed at your own risk.)\n\nToday, we will be analyzing the outcomes of impartially investing into companies, holding all else constant, in anticipation of their earnings releases. There is no doubt that earnings season is a fascinating period, where otherwise low beta stocks have the potential to move double digit percentages on an improved (or retracted) outlook on a company\'s guidance. For more speculative investments, a beat or miss can provide even greater movement. And with these movements, of course, comes the possibility of major gains. Who doesn\'t like major gains?\n\nBut the disappointing reality is that attempting to play earnings is nothing more than glorified speculation. And when you consider the enabling attitude of online communities, caution is thrown to the wind. In a 2015 article by [Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/avoid-gambling-on-earnings-results-2015-01-22), they argue that:\n\n&gt;""In fact, anyone who takes positions ahead of a stock\'s earnings release in anticipation of a stock\'s move is speculating and gambling, and although it is a very popular practice by smaller investors, more seasoned investors tend to avoid taking positions at that time. They realize that they do not know where the stock will move, even if they are confident in their earnings predictions because stocks often move in surprising ways after earnings releases.""\n\nAnd as is further pointed out, premiums leading up to earnings can be run up to exceptional levels, and unless you are trading an inherently volatile stock that usually maintains high option premiums, premiums can fall off a cliff following earnings, no matter the direction. The article goes on to point out additional risks with playing the earnings ""guessing game.""\n\nOk, that seems pretty intuitive. But I think there is a competitive advantage to be had, somewhere, someway. Right? Markets cannot be 100% efficient: dissemination of information is not perfect. What if then, we could attempt to find this competitive advantage. We could backtrack to previous earnings, evaluate current earnings, and screen across different fundamentals to see if there are any discernible trends. What could go wrong.\n\nSo, I sought to ignorantly invest in all companies reporting earnings over the week of 5/11 to 5/15, and evaluate whether there were any interesting insights we could come up with.\n\n# Methodology:\n\nAs you can tell from the title, this post is Part 1 of an ongoing series of posts, week to week, evaluating earnings under this lens. With this being said, the methodology I use in this first week is...primitive (to say the least) but will be refined week to week, targeting an end goal of identifying an observable trend.\n\n1. **Timeline.** For this report, I will be evaluating earnings reports covering the trading week beginning 5/11 and ending 5/15. In the future, I plan on backtesting previous weeks once we\'ve refined our methodology. For the time being, we will be forward looking.\n2. **What Earnings to ""Play?""** For this analysis, I will be referencing earningswhispers.com\'s ""**Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the trading week beginning \\[insert Monday of chosen week\\]""** earnings calendar. If you aren\'t familiar with r/EarningsWhispers, they create weekly earnings ""calendars"" that detail popular companies\' earnings reports for a given week, organized based on date and time of release (before market open or after market close). Having worked in-depth with their calendars while setting up this analysis, I feel that their calendars represent a solid mixture of companies, specifically diverse in risk (value/growth), market capitalization (large/small/micro), and sectors, and industries. For this report, I will be referencing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWhispers/comments/gghsn7/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the/) earnings calendar. If there are any recommendations for services with more comprehensive report coverage, please let me know.\n3. **Investment Size.** To ensure that we were able to buy into all companies (no matter how high their share price was), I designated $1000 per investment. I tested again using $100 per investment, and the percentage difference was negligible. Besides, with fractional shares accessible on major platforms, investment size is less about concern and more about standardizing the return % we get.\n4. **Security of Choice and Holding Period.** For my first iteration of this project, I decided to invest using common stocks instead of options. Although options are the go-to choice for playing earnings, I figured starting with fewer variables, i.e. common stocks, would be a good foundation. Later on, I\'d be interested in redoing these scenarios with options. For each stocks\' holding period, I chose a 24-hour timeframe in order to minimize non-earnings influences. My rationale was as follows. For BO stock, purchasing the stock at close the day before the pre-market earnings release would reasonably approximate the markets anticipation of earnings pre-market and reaction to earnings through the following trading day, eliminating the impact of non-earnings news as much as possible. I applied this same rationale to the AO stock, however it is more difficult to approximate because the market\'s accessibility to anticipation/reaction prices is flipped: anticipation for a BO stock is purely institutional investors (while reaction comes from the broader market) while anticipation for an AO stock comes from the broader market (while the subsequent reaction following earnings is from after-hours trading).

Thanks for the support!', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Playing the Earnings Calendar: An Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing [Pt.1]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Note: This is not investment advice. The results of this research should not be generalized over thousands of weeks of earnings releases. Proceed at your own risk.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, we will be analyzing the outcomes of impartially investing into companies, holding all else constant, in anticipation of their earnings releases. There is no doubt that earnings season is a fascinating period, where otherwise low beta stocks have the potential to move double digit percentages on an improved (or retracted) outlook on a company&amp;#39;s guidance. For more speculative investments, a beat or miss can provide even greater movement. And with these movements, of course, comes the possibility of major gains. Who doesn&amp;#39;t like major gains?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the disappointing reality is that attempting to play earnings is nothing more than glorified speculation. And when you consider the enabling attitude of online communities, caution is thrown to the wind. In a 2015 article by &lt;a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/avoid-gambling-on-earnings-results-2015-01-22""&gt;Market Watch&lt;/a&gt;, they argue that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In fact, anyone who takes positions ahead of a stock&amp;#39;s earnings release in anticipation of a stock&amp;#39;s move is speculating and gambling, and although it is a very popular practice by smaller investors, more seasoned investors tend to avoid taking positions at that time. They realize that they do not know where the stock will move, even if they are confident in their earnings predictions because stocks often move in surprising ways after earnings releases.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as is further pointed out, premiums leading up to earnings can be run up to exceptional levels, and unless you are trading an inherently volatile stock that usually maintains high option premiums, premiums can fall off a cliff following earnings, no matter the direction. The article goes on to point out additional risks with playing the earnings &amp;quot;guessing game.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, that seems pretty intuitive. But I think there is a competitive advantage to be had, somewhere, someway. Right? Markets cannot be 100% efficient: dissemination of information is not perfect. What if then, we could attempt to find this competitive advantage. We could backtrack to previous earnings, evaluate current earnings, and screen across different fundamentals to see if there are any discernible trends. What could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I sought to ignorantly invest in all companies reporting earnings over the week of 5/11 to 5/15, and evaluate whether there were any interesting insights we could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Methodology:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can tell from the title, this post is Part 1 of an ongoing series of posts, week to week, evaluating earnings under this lens. With this being said, the methodology I use in this first week is...primitive (to say the least) but will be refined week to week, targeting an end goal of identifying an observable trend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline.&lt;/strong&gt; For this report, I will be evaluating earnings reports covering the trading week beginning 5/11 and ending 5/15. In the future, I plan on backtesting previous weeks once we&amp;#39;ve refined our methodology. For the time being, we will be forward looking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Earnings to &amp;quot;Play?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; For this analysis, I will be referencing earningswhispers.com&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the trading week beginning [insert Monday of chosen week]&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; earnings calendar. If you aren&amp;#39;t familiar with &lt;a href=""/r/EarningsWhispers""&gt;r/EarningsWhispers&lt;/a&gt;, they create weekly earnings &amp;quot;calendars&amp;quot; that detail popular companies&amp;#39; earnings reports for a given week, organized based on date and time of release (before market open or after market close). Having worked in-depth with their calendars while setting up this analysis, I feel that their calendars represent a solid mixture of companies, specifically diverse in risk (value/growth), market capitalization (large/small/micro), and sectors, and industries. For this report, I will be referencing &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWhispers/comments/gghsn7/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the/""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; earnings calendar. If there are any recommendations for services with more comprehensive report coverage, please let me know.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Size.&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure that we were able to buy into all companies (no matter how high their share price was), I designated $1000 per investment. I tested again using $100 per investment, and the percentage difference was negligible. Besides, with fractional shares accessible on major platforms, investment size is less about concern and more about standardizing the return % we get.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security of Choice and Holding Period.&lt;/strong&gt; For my first iteration of this project, I decided to invest using common stocks instead of options. Although options are the go-to choice for playing earnings, I figured starting with fewer variables, i.e. common stocks, would be a good foundation. Later on, I&amp;#39;d be interested in redoing these scenarios with options. For each stocks&amp;#39; holding period, I chose a 24-hour timeframe in order to minimize non-earnings influences. My rationale was as follows. For BO stock, purchasing the stock at close the day before the pre-market earnings release would reasonably approximate the markets anticipation of earnings pre-market and reaction to earnings through the following trading day, eliminating the impact of non-earnings news as much as possible. I applied this same rationale to the AO stock, however it is more difficult to approximate because the market&amp;#39;s accessibility to anticipation/reaction prices is flipped: anticipation for a BO stock is purely institutional investors (while reaction comes from the broader market) while anticipation for an AO stock comes from the broader market (while the subsequent reaction following earnings is from after-hours trading).

Anyone else think a crash is to come and plans to take short positions in stocks? I think a crash is coming. I think once the crash comes it may take years for the stock market to rebound to current levels. Unemployment is soaring, a vaccine seems like will take a long time to develop, and the unprecedented government stimulus payments (unemployment, PPP, ect) will eventually run out. Heck! The economy is in shambles even with these payments (things will be way worse once the run out). 

I do not know when it is going to crash, but I plan to take short positions on Monday. I plan to short stocks and buy put options in others.

I will do some research tomorrow but have identified the below stocks as potential shorts. What are you shorting? Do you agree or disagree with any of the below?

I feel like this is a basic question, but I'm admittedly guessing. For years I've been a set it and forget it investor. I've dumped everything into VTSAX, and have done quite well.  

I have ~$100K in my taxable brokerage account currently, about $80K of which is VTSAX. Much of this was invested last year when I left my employer as I received a lump sump. Due to this, my cost basis is negative; or rather VTSAX was higher at the time so it's slightly negative.  

My father mentioned that I should sell all of my VTSAX holdings now, as it won't have a tax impact, and then rebuy them after 30 days (due to the wash rule). Does this make sense? So I wouldn't remove the proceeds from my account, but would sit on them and then rebuy in say mid to late June. Thoughts?

Long term I think the market is going down and we're going into a deflationary period. Someone suggested investing in an etf that inverses the market and when researching this the following etf came up.

I don't really understand the volatility of the 2x factor and there appears to be some warnings on the prospectus about the value being cumulative and this leading to big gains/losses and thus you should check the value of the investment daily.

Can someone explain in simple terms what this etf does. Basically I want a passive index fund that inverses the market and when it goes down, the value of my investment goes up but in a long term, passive way which is relatively low risk low reward.

Then let’s say in the next 5 mins of you trading more people buy stock making the stock price go to 20!.

Take a look at our post and see why we believe in PK. Disclosure - we have positions in PK, starting mid-March 2020.

\--- 

PK is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that holds the real estate property that HLT uses. PK was spun out to make HLT an asset-light company. According to HLT's 2019 annual report, it only owned $380M in property.

We believe PK is a significantly better buy than HLT for the following reasons:

1. **PK is currently valued at $1.8B while its real estate value minus all liabilities equal $5B.** There is a significant discrepancy between PK's market value and the intrinsic value of the real estate it holds. On the other hand, HLT is valued at $17B. However, HLT holds $10B in goodwill and brand value on its balance sheet. PK is a better buy because it holds more real value than HLT.
2. **PK is currently 77% down from its 52-week high compared to HLT which is 45% down from its 52-week high.** PK is a better buy because it has significantly higher upside than HLT.
3. **PK historically pays $0.43 - $1.00 per share in dividends compared to HLT which historically pays $0.07 - $0.15 per share.** HLT has suspended dividend payments while PK has not definitively suspended dividend payments yet.
4. **PK currently has $4.8B in liabilities while HLT has $15.5B in liabilities.** PK is well able to cover its liabilities with $11B in assets while HLT cannot cover its liabilities with $15B in assets.

In summary, both PK and HLT have &gt;$1B in cash on hand or option to withdraw from their revolving credit facility and will likely be able to survive the COVID-19 crisis. However, PK is a much better investment than HLT for those interested in playing the upside in the hospitality industry. We are very bullish on PK and will continue investing in the REIT.",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,413012,public,confidence,self,Bill Ackman Took Our Advice and Bought Park Hotels (PK).

# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there’s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.
*****
&gt; Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.
*****
&gt; Investors’ focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government’s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on “60 Minutes” Sunday night.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.
*****
&gt; # Home sweet home
&gt; “Housing is going to be important in that you’ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,” said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. “That’s going to be an issue. One of the key things we’re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There’s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren’t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. “That’s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,” she said.
*****
&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe’s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
*****
&gt; “Market reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. “The markets right now don’t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.”
*****
&gt; # Solvency concerns
&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.
*****
&gt; “There’s an interesting kind of threshold here as we’re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We’re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,” said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.
*****
&gt; “The longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That’s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,” Arone said.
*****
&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. “The reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,” he said. “Look out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the Fed’s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.
*****
&gt; “The numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we’re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we’re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don’t have reason to believe that’s not the case,” he said.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a ‘B’ of ‘B+’ based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.
*****
&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.
*****
&gt; “If all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that’s going to be injected into peoples’ arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,” Emanuel said.
*****
&gt; # Range bound
&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.
*****
&gt; “We have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It’s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,” said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.
*****
&gt; “I think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,” he said.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.
*****
&gt; “On a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it’s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,” Emanuel said. “If you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don’t necessarily know if that’s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.”
*****
&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.
*****
&gt; “Part of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they’ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn’t a ton of fuel for the downside there,” said Emanuel.

# Retail Sales Telling the Economy’s Story

&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.

&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “One of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “As the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there”

&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.

&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.

# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?

&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric—one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs—valuations may be getting too much attention.

&gt; “Stocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “While the return to 2019’s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.”

&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:

&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we’ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year’s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.
&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn’t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock’s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.
&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.

&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we’re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.

# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine

&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.

&gt; “From COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.

# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower

&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.

&gt; Today’s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.

# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves

&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**

&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**

&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, ""During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?"" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.

# Investors Remain On Guard

&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors’ portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.

&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.

I’ve been conducting a lot of experiments lately, particularly with different portfolio splits and investing strategies (i.e option spreads, different sectors).

I see many investors focus too much on one component (i.e returns) at the cost of another (i.e volatility).

Example: Focus too much on huge returns by adding lots of leverage while ignoring volatility and huge drawdowns that come with said strategy.

I wrote a small post on the “what” and the “why” of alpha (returns), beta (volatility), and drawdown, and I threw in a bonus on the importance of position sizing.

Check it out if you’re interested.

I was wondering if anyone could explain why there can be a large price difference between stocks listed on the NYSE and another stock exchange. Specifically, I started looking at Foresight Autonomous FRSX, an Israeli company which is listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) at a price significantly higher than what it’s going for on the NYSE. On TASE it’s 62.9 ila, or roughly $18 usd, per share. On the NYSE it’s $.79 usd right now. Comparing the daily charts they followed each other today, falling 7.5% and 8% respectively. So they at least seem to correlate there.

We got 3.5k members in discord. Every morning Monday \~ Thursday is when we trade, no Fridays. Fridays are only traded on rare occasions. We trade from the time market opens and closes meaning everyone can get trades in throughout the day. Our group is not a course, or anything like that. This group is led by 1 guy who gives all the signals to you. He is 95% accurate on all his alerts and we focus on trading only quality stocks like TSLA, AAPL, NFLX, BA. You buy when your told to buy, and sell anytime you want while your in the green, but he also gives several signals when to get out of an active trade as well. As long as you follow the group signals you will make money. We haven't had a single day where we go red (negative) for the day. Every day is a green day, everyday is a profitable day. You do exactly what is signaled and you will win. All the contract prices that are signaled are at affordable prices around the 1.0\~4.0 mark. Everyone in our group can always get 1-3 contracts at least based on your account portfolio you can buy even more contracts.  


Trades last couple minutes only, they're fast paced as you know option trading is fast paced, but its also high rewarding. Risk management here is high as well, meaning if a signal were to ever go wrong direction we get out with -5% stop loss. We always end the day profitable no matter what. We do about 2-4 trades a day, averaging 40-100% profits daily. There is a membership fee, of course with any successful group the group leader who's signaling out for over 3.5K members has to make his money as well, its a a business after all. Its $250 per month, but you I'll give you $100 off your first month so $150. You will make that membership fee back in 1 day of trading with us. All members average at least 100-200+ per day, and more depending on how many contracts you buy of course.. You also get hands-on training, coaching, and guidance on how to use our group and understanding our signal callouts, and to practice executing the trades fast. This is no gimmic, no Bs, no advertising hoax, our group is the real deal and people post their profits everyday with screenshots showing how much they made. Waking up every morning knowing your going to 100% profit is something majority of people in the stock market do not get to do. We give members here a piece of mind knowing they're in good hands and that they're going to succeed everyday. IF your interested, I can explain further and help you get setup with everything. I also help setup TD Ameritrade cash account so you can avoid PDT rule meaning you can trade unlimited times without needing 25k in your account, majority of our members here use thinkorswim. It's the best platform for option trading.

You never have to worry about losing money with us period. Everyday before i joined this group years ago I'd wake up anxious and nervous on if i'd make money that morning. ever since i joined this group I never had to worry about a thing. I trade daily knowing i'll profit and thats something millions of others that play the stock market, cannot say. Doesn't matter how many charts and data you study, in the stock market people always lose money even those that spend years of their lives studying this shit. So it's easier to join a group that tells you what to do and is very successful at it.

If you're interested just shoot me a message here or add me on discord (Prime#0274), and i'll give you all the details and screenshots to show you what we're about :)",True,False,False,StockMarket,t5_2qjuv,412496,public,confidence,self,"Read this if you are into options trading and you're New, or in-consistent at trading, and want to just be told when to Buy &amp; Sell instead of wasting months/years of trying to figure out the stock market.",0,[],0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gkdt2b/read_this_if_you_are_into_options_trading_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,1589565390.0,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I am new to trading CFDs and started trading when corona first hit and have made a decent amount.

&amp;#x200B;

I am continuing to trade with a few open positions on the WTI oil contract expiring 22-June (I moved over about two weeks early having been aware of the previous plummet of contract prices) using Trading212 as my broker.

&amp;#x200B;

I have received a lot of warning (and rightly so) about the potential movement of the contract back into negative territory for the current contract which expires on Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

From my understanding, I am not trading on the contract ending on the 19th of March and so I shouldn't have to worry about a price plunge.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you someone could clarify:

When people say 19th march contract expiring Monday would this be referred to as a 'June contract' as delivery is expected to be taken in June? E.G my current positions would be a 'July contract'?

&amp;#x200B;

What is the likelihood that a plunge on the previous contract deadline 19th March would affect the WTI 22-June contract which I currently hold CFDs for?

* They are formerly known as Depomed, they have transformed theur company with a current focus on [three FDA-approved products](https://www.assertiotx.com/) in their core areas of neurology, orphan, and specialty medicines as they continue to identify, license, and develop new products that offer enhanced options for patients who may be underserved by existing therapies. 

**Assertio Pipeline Products**
* Currently, Assertio had two products that are past P3 of clinical trails and have been [Submitted to the FDA](https://www.assertiotx.com/products-and-pipeline/pipeline/)
 for approval, those products are:
- Diclofenac Potassium: Mild/moderate acute pain 12-17 years
- Long-acting Cosyntropin: Diagnosis of Adrenal Insufficiency

This is very important due to fact that if they are approved, it will provide a huge jump to their stock price/value

**Their patented technology**
* Their [patented technology is known as Acuform. It is a patented polymer-based tech designed to optimize drug delivery.](https://www.assertiotx.com/products-and-pipeline/technology/)
* Acuform technology is currently being used in multiple marketed products and being evaluated internally and with other potential partners for many additional compounds.
* With Acuform technology, unique swelling polymers allow tablets to be retained in the stomach—the preferential absorption site for many oral drugs—for 8–10 hours vs the 3 hours seen with immediate-release and some extended-release formulations.
* This gradual, extended release allows for more drug absorption in the upper GI tract, offering the potential for greater efficacy and increased tolerability, with the convenience of once- or twice-daily dosing.
* Tablets utilizing Acuform technology can be tailored to deliver new drug combinations of varying properties, either simultaneously or sequentially, for a wide array of product possibilities
* Here is a [link for the actual Acuform patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6723340B2/en) if you're interested in reading it.

* [The first Quarter of 2020](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results)
 proved to be the beginning of what is set to be an amazing year financial and medically for Assertio Therapeutics. 
* Their [EPS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/assertio-asrt-beats-q1-earnings-143502488.html)
 was .10 thus beating set EPS expectations of -.08 by 225%
*Their [revenue for Q1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/assertio-asrt-beats-q1-earnings-143502488.html)
 was $20.92 Million thus beating set revenue expectations of $11.3 Million by 85.16%

**You may wonder how/why their revenue is considered positive despite it being 30M less than the previous quarter. I'll explain why right now**
* The reason for the revenue being considered positive despite it lower than the previous quarter is due to the fact of the sales of two of their drugs to other companies

**Sales of both NUCYNTA &amp;Gralise**
* [Assertio sold NUCYNTA franchise to collegium pharmaceuticals](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/06/1981407/0/en/Assertio-Therapeutics-Announces-Sale-of-NUCYNTA-Franchise-to-Collegium-Pharmaceutical-for-375-0-Million.html) for a total of $375 million dollars in addition, they also paid for inventory relating to NUCYNTA

* Sold both for a combined total of [$502.5 Million dollars](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results)

**Why the sale of two high earning products is amazing &amp; what it sets up for Q2-Q4 of 2020**
* With the combined sale of NUCYNTA &amp; Gralise for $502M, Assertio was able to [repay their senior debt in full](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/assertio-therapeutics-announces-closing-of-sale-of-nucynta-franchise-to-collegium-pharmaceutical-for-375-0-millionalso-announces-its-senior-secured-debt-has-been-repaid-in-full/)
* Repaying their Senior debt in full is amazing because with the sale closing and the accelerated repayment of their senior debt obligations, it allows Assertio Therapeutics the ability to invest in their core business which will help them build and grow for the future. 
* [the Company has also retired substantially all of its outstanding Convertible Notes](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results) through $188.0 million of privately negotiated purchase agreements and a tender of an additional $76.7 million.
* The sale of NUCYNTA &amp; Gralise sets up the the merger of Assertio Therapeutics with Zyla 

**The Merger of Zyla into Assertio Therapeutics**
* Early 2020, Assertio Therapeutics [announces the agreement to merge with Zyla](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/16/2001519/0/en/Assertio-Therapeutics-Agrees-to-Merge-with-Zyla-Life-Sciences-to-Create-Synergistic-Portfolio-of-Neurology-and-Non-Opioid-Pain-Products.html) Life Sciences to create a synergestic portfolio of Neurology &amp; non-opiod pain products.
*The merged company will remain where Assertio is based, in Lake Forrest Illinois.
* The merged company will keep Assertio's name and trade on Nasdaq under the ASRT ticker symbol.
* Assertio therapeutics will hold 68% ownership &amp; Zyla will hold 32% ownership of the merged company
* Under the deal, Zyla stockholders will receive 2.5 common shares of the combined company for each common share of Zyla held.

* I genuinely believe in their products and I believe in their CEOs and I believe in the merger. 
* The way they are handling and changing courses for this year has been incredibly successful so far &amp; the proof is there with those sales and with beating set expectations of them by wide margins.
* Not only that, but theyre responsible with the new large amounts of cash they've received and the proof is there with them fully paying off their debt
* [Plus the CEOs of Assertio &amp; Zyla who will be running the newly merged company have 25 &amp; 35 years of experience and have previously held high ranking positions](http://investor.assertiotx.com/static-files/81290326-b4a8-4156-872b-6e90487dcbdd) with Bayer, Abbot Laboratories pharmaceutical division, Enzon pharmaceuticals &amp; Horizon Therapeutics

* For those reasons mentioned above, I firmly believe this company will be trading higher than the $1.35 target price.
