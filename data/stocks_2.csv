I’ll list my ideas and my doubts about it, have to say that i get a 10€ fee per purchase so I’d rather buy only one or two at best of these companies (Just to avoid confusion, the fee is per purchase, not per stock, so for 10 stocks of the same company the bank would still charge me only 10€, not 100€)


AAPL, do you think it will go down a bit after the china factories will reopen on the 10th? I saw that it may cause some damage for the AirPods production.


MSFT, my concern on this is that it is in a huge spike right now, so maybe should I wait for the first dip and buy then?


NVDA, I like its efforts in the self-deiving cars development, edge computing, all trends that will be huge int he future imo, but I’m not too sure about it, also because I own AMD and I think i should maybe get something different.


INTC, I think that they’ll have a big part in the 5G world, and also the Olympics eSport is a project I think will be a success for them.  Same thoguht about owning AMD.


TSM, I don’t know much about this company, but the semiconductor need in the future can only get higher, so seem a good investment


LSCC, same as TSM.



Also another question is: do you think I should sell RACE to buy some of these, or keep it?

So I have been playing around with a stocks game, it uses real stocks but with fake money basically.

I bought 400 Virgin Galatic Shares for 8199, and a few days later it dropped to 3650 so I lost 4548.

The average Nikkei index fell 0.2% to 23,827.98.

The index closed 2.4% higher on Thursday, a maximum of 13 months after China's decision provided some help to global financial markets caused by the rapid spread of coronavirus.

Weekly growth was 2.7%, which was the best indicator for eight weeks.

The limiting losses in the index were SoftBank shares, which rose 7.1% after media reports that Elliott Management had accumulated nearly $ 3 billion in the Japanese conglomerate and was striving for changes in management and transparency.

The overall Topix index fell 0.2% to 1733.32 after rising 2.1% in the previous session on profit-taking ahead of the weekend.

All but six of the 33 industry subindexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were in negative territory: textiles, air transport, and insurance were the largest in losses.

At the height of Japan’s revenue season, Olympus Corp climbed 9.9% to its all-time high after a medical device maker posted record operating profit between April and December and raised its annual earnings forecast.

Although financial markets have found some consolation from China's incentive measures and are seeking to lower import tariffs on some products in the US, investors remain concerned about the outbreak of coronavirus and its wider impact on companies and the economy.

On Thursday, a viral epidemic led to a reduction in production in many global companies.

Toyota Motor Corp fell 0.7% as the automaker said production at all of its factories in China would be suspended until February 16, joining a growing number of automakers facing interruptions due to supply chain problems.

Honda Motor Co fell 2.7% after the automaker said it would continue to work at its automobile plants in Wuhan, China, suspended until February 13, as previously planned.

Nintendo fell 1% after the gaming company said delays in the production and delivery of its Switch console and Joy-Con controllers due to the coronavirus epidemic are ""inevitable.""

Takara Bio Inc shares rose 11.1% after Nikkei reported that the company intends to 50 times increase the production of coronavirus testing reagent at its Dalian plant in response to an urgent request from a Chinese city.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,485668,public,self,Japanese stocks are losing momentum on profit-taking; SoftBank Group is on the rise,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f08ev1/japanese_stocks_are_losing_momentum_on/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

OR is it saying even though the strike price is lower than the current stock, as long as the stock price raises more than $12, as a call buyer, if the he/she chooses to exercise the option, then buyer can buy the stock for $12/share, and sell it back to market for a profit while the current market stock price is $12+? (If this true, then wouldn't every call buyer want to choose a lower strike price rather than choosing a higher strike price?)

I’m researching about Draftkings and their potential company to merge to be public, DEAC.

How is your experience with DK? I love the fantasy sports league and deceived to pay some entry fees to test by myself.

I like the interface of the site and the app. It is stable but I have not been played in the peak season so not 100% sure.

The company and the industry is profitable b/c 
1. Cash business
2. Have good liceansings with the major sport leagues
3. Highly online orientated.
4. Market share is strong.

My concerns are
1. Will people pay money to play if they can get it for free? But no prize.
2. Can they expend their business to the international level?
3. Can they really merge with three companies? Risk to have the deal breaker.

Ripple is a strong tech player (valued at $10B) bought 10% stake to make MGI the shining example of how XRP can revolutionize cross border payments.  They will not let MGI fail and they have deep pockets.

- Ripple’s Cross-Border Bet on XRP Just Hit Record-Breaking Volume in Mexico and the Philippines

- Brinks just bought 5% stake b/c they see value.

- First money transfer company to launch Visa Direct. 

- MoneyGram Achieves Record Online Transaction Growth over the Holidays 

- Recently, the company also launched its mobile app with features like biometric identification, location finder, transfer tracking and exchange rates and fee estimates.. The app and the online platform are available in 24 countries and in the second quarter, its non-U.S. online transaction growth was more than 100% year over year.

- **partnering with big player in India**. MoneyGram $MGI, EbixCash $EBIX team to tap India market. EbixCash will help MoneyGram scale its service outlets considerably in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Telangana, which witness migration to the Middle East countries. The strategic partnership aims to service annual inward remittance volumes of $3B targeting remitters in key sending markets outside India. Net revenues for EbixCash are expected to be between $20M &amp; $35M annually, once fully rolled out. Remittances are money or goods that migrants send back to families and friends in their countries. MoneyGram will now be able to reach additional consumers through Ebix's 320,000 distribution outlets across 768 districts, 4,000 cities, and more than 75,000 villages, significantly increasing coverage in rural areas.

- It's worth recalling MGI disclosed (in pertinent part) in an SEC Form 8-K filed 11-15-2019 (the entirety of which can be found in the link below): ""On November 11, 2019, MoneyGram International, Inc. (the “Company”) committed to an operational plan to reduce overall operating expenses, including the elimination of between 70 and 90 positions across the Company (the “2019 Organizational Realignment”). The workforce reduction is designed to streamline operations and structure the Company in a way that will be more agile and aligned around our plan to execute market-specific strategies tailored to different segments. The Company expects to complete the workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of 2020.

I started trading stocks a little over a year ago. Most of my 401(k) contributions go into a standard retirement fund but I set aside some cash to play around with. I have made some money in value stocks, but since I am not regularly contributing to the brokerage link I generally do not hold past 20%-30% profit. So I have kind of fallen into swing trading without following any particular method. I was reading about indicators the other day and learned about MACD. It is supposedly easy to follow and somewhat reliable...

So I am wondering if anyone else uses MACD as a buy/sell indicator and how it has worked out?

I am finding the chart not as intuitive as suggested. At least the indicators are usually not as obvious as the examples Investopedia uses. In many cases the MACD line just hugs the signal line in a somewhat linear fashion. The convergence/divergence doesn’t scream to me any particular trend. I can also see many instances in a stocks history where the MACD line triggers a sell while the price continues to go up.

Like I said, I am new to this concept so it is probably just a matter of experience. I have started making hypothetical trades based on my observations. If anyone has some lessons learned they would like to share, I would greatly appreciate it.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,484363,public,self,Using the MACD indicator for swing trading,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/eztnso/using_the_macd_indicator_for_swing_trading/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A stock with good fundamentals is found. A look at the daily chart reveals the stock price is at a major resistance zone. We identify the next resistance zone upwards and the support zone below. The earnings call is happening after hours. 

At this point, we know that one of two things may happen. If the earnings are positive, the price can break the resistance zone where it is idle and possibly continue to the next resistance zone. If the earnings are negative, the price can drop down to the previous support zone.

We can make a prediction about where the price will go either way. Without going any further, this leaves us at a 50/50 of the price going in either direction.

I'm really only interested if we continue to see movement downward, however, i'm skeptical of some analysts sentiment, and have an interesting take.

I hear a lot of  analysts talking about TikTok being competition for Snap. My personal opinion is that Snap actually benefits from TikTok. As a user of TikTok I see people on there linking there snapchat, or telling their followers to add them on Snapchat. Using TikTok has dramatically decreased my time spent on Instagram, but has no effect on the time I spend on Snapchat.

The purchase comes after the company reported decent results on January 23rd with full year 2019, earnings $373.0 million, (EPS $4.06) compared to $351.7 million (EPS $3.81) for the full year 2018.

Valuation looks also very reasonable with trailing PE of 11.8 and yield of 3.3%.

However, the great thing about Webster Bank is it is the parent company of HSA Bank, which provides banking services to consumers who want to save money for future healthcare costs with a health savings account.

The beauty of HSA banking is twofold. First, few people care about the interest rate they earn on their deposits into an HSA. Second, once opened, HSAs are one of the rare types of accounts in which the balance grows month after month and year after year.

With a fast-growing treasure trove of low-cost deposits, Webster can be a below-average bank in almost every other regard -- it could make more bad loans, spend too much on fancy offices, and so on -- and still eke out a higher-than-average return on equity thanks to its exceptional HSA Bank business.

Wouldn’t that decrease the stock’s value, because each share is now worth less of a percentage of the company?

A nasdaq article titled “Where will Plug Power be in 10 years?” Says 

&gt;Over the past decade, investors in Plug have seen shares outstanding in their company grow 18 times in volume, from 12.9 million shares at the end of 2009 to 245.8 million shares today. On the plus side, so long as investors remain willing to buy Plug shares and provide Plug the cash it needs to survive, there's actually a good chance that Plug will remain in business for another 10 years. The problem, though, is that even assuming Plug ""makes it,"" and even assuming the company ultimately earns a profit (eventually), given the rampant dilution going on, by the time that profit does arrive it will be so diluted by so many shares outstanding that any profits accruing to any single investor will be de minimis.
&amp;gt; Long story short: 10 years from now, Plug Power may well still be in business -- but I wouldn't want to own it.

So are they saying the dividends will be low from them? If so, I don’t care, as long as the stock price has gone up.

This is rare, and since the 1950s, this very incident has been the most credible indicator of an upcoming recession at all. In fact, the 10-2 indicator has been right every single time that the indicator has seriously erupted. Although the stock market is currently reaching new heights, the reality is that it is a completely classic process following a cross of the yield curve and up to a recession. In other periods, the same enthusiasm has hit the market, which has risen on average 15% before the heavy hammer hit. The hardest hit comes on average 22 months after the first signal from the 10-2 indicator. It shows figures from Credit Suisse. So the danger is not over, but there are no reason to panic yet. As it may take several months before the recession emerges.

(Been lurking for years, however...)

25+ years trading experience; to include over 15 years professionally with noted firms.

In addition to my regular trading, three or four times a year I go relatively big on low market cap stocks that have based near their all-time lows and are trading well off their 52 week and/or all-time highs.

I take a large position (usually 100,000+ shares+), and then simply wait.

For example, currently I'm long 200,000 $VIVE @ an average price of $1.15.

Justification: 52 week high of $116 (split-adjusted).  52 week low of .79 cents.  A mere three months ago: $5+.

I'm presently down around $25k on this trade, but on a percentage basis still well within my pain tolerance.  It's all about the charts on these small cap trades!

Goal: a minimum $250k profit on this particular trade.

Note to mods: this is 100% not a pump post, and I'm not advocating anyone here buy VIVE.  

Rather, I'm posting my position on VIVE in the event anyone here trades - or is interested in trading - similar stocks, is a position trader, or trades according to chart patterns.

However, for individual stocks, I often see recommendations to wait for a dip. This makes sense to me because individual stocks are much more volatile and easier to reason about (though if I'm wrong here, please let me know).

If it is indeed good to wait for a dip in individual stocks while investing regularly into index funds, then where does the money come from to buy individual stocks when they dip? Do you just sell off some index funds that they've been regularly investing into, and then buy individual stocks with those proceeds? If so, is there any worry that the transaction time for selling the index funds might cause you to miss the dip?

75% is still what i see as aggressive growth. Basically like 8-10 mutual funds across different areas,  S&amp;P500, international utilities, defense etc.

10% is in a value fund.

10% is in a bond EFT that is giving about 3% dividends

10% is in AGVT which is a Real estate company paying about 11% dividends. as i was trying to move some investments to dividend stocks

5% is in cash for the moment. I've consider putting this into the same bond fund,  3% isn't awful, is there a better place that is less risky than an index fund?",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,483143,public,self,How to reduce risk,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ezbakt/how_to_reduce_risk/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; **Disney (DIS)** — Disney shares dipped 0.8% after the media giant failed to update the guidance for its online streaming service, Disney+. The company had previously forecast subscriber growth between 60 million and 90 million by fiscal 2024. The subscriber growth overshadowed better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the company.

Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected revenue of $563 million. The company’s average revenue per user (ARPU) — a key metric for social media companies — also missed analysts’ expectations.

With analyst increasing their long term price targets for TSLA all the way up to $7,000; the stock clearly has room to run if they are correct.  

The charts for Tesla in 2020 and bitcoin in 2017 look very similar.  Charts won't predict the future, but they will help investors make an educated decision.

Tesla would experience a 3,800% increase from it's June 2019 price if it achieves a $7,000 price target. That's more than bitcoin's meteoric rise.  

Even if the analysts are correct, it's going to be a bumpy ride along the way.  Just look at bitcoin's rise and fall and take some lessons from history.

As of March 2019, the company had 115 North American stores and 2 stores located in the United Kingdom and Spain. 

You don’t get that kind of value without there being some issues and this speculative microcap has a few;

1. Accounting irregularities regarding stock that have delayed the publication of Q2 and Q3 results
2. Poor performance in 2018
3. Amazon risk

Accounting irregularities is the main issue, however I believe each of the issues can be satisfactorily mitigated by the following;

&amp;#x200B;

1. TLF retained independent legal who have reported that they did not find any evidence of fraud or intentional misconduct. The inventory is estimated to be overstated by $0.5mm compared to stockholder equity of $60mm.  The firm has reported in preliminary results that it generated cash of $2.7mm  and $2.3mm in q2 and q3.
2. A poor performance in 2018 was due to writing off stock from unprofitable and international stores that is now complete.  The company has high margins but low turnover.  The new CEO believes they can almost double turnover which would obviously boost profitability further.
3. Amazon has not posed a threat.  The firm’s niche is highly profitable but, with TLF’s $83mm annual sales making it the largest operator, it is not large enough to constitute a priority for Amazon.  The craft nature of TLF’s service means that customers still prefer to come into the store and feel and smell the product rather than simply buying online.

TLF has until February 17th to post its Q2 and Q3 results which will probably, based on preliminary figures, show cash flow totalling $5mm.  That follows net op cash flow of $3mm in Q1 and, even though Q4 is usually the strongest, I assume cash generation of $2.5mm in Q4 .  That brings the total to over $10mm for the year.  Market cap is $49mm including cash of $22.6mm (zero debt).

Putting everything together I estimate a cashflow of $10.5mm compared to an economic value of $26.4mm.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.

I am new to buying/trading stocks and would like to ask users on here who are experienced in the field for advice. Thank you for your help and time!

1) What are some apps or medium that you recommend using for buying and trading stocks, and why?

2) With the whole Coronavirus epidemic going on right now, what are some stocks worth looking into and avoid?

3) What are some safe stocks that I should start off with first to get familiar with the stock market? What are some moderately safe stocks? Finally, what are some pricy stocks that I should build my way up towards?

4) When buying or trading stocks, what are certain stats or aspects that I should take into consideration to best predict their value?

5) What are some sources that I should use to monitor the directions certain stocks are heading? How could I go about differentiating bad source from good source?

6) When is a good time to sell/trade stocks and when is a good time to buy them? Why those times in particular?

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, February 4th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/what-to-watch-dow-to-soar-delayed-caucus-results-trumps-big-speech.html)

* Despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, U.S. stock futures were pointing sharply higher this morning as stocks continue to chip away at last Friday’s losses. Monday’s rally put the S&amp;P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC)
* The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others.
* Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers. (CNBC)
* Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOGL) shares slid 3% the premarket despite beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, as the company came in light on revenue. The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC)
* Google still isn’t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC)
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday’s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday’s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC)
* Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state’s Democratic Party said a “reporting issue” caused “inconsistencies” in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC)
* Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC)
* President Donald Trump will be unleashing “relentless optimism” during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: “The Great American Comeback.” (AP)
* The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday’s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump’s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC)
* Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city’s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak. This would be the second known death outside of mainland China. Chinese health officials said earlier that in mainland China the total now sits at 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases.
* No, garlic won’t protect you from coronavirus: WHO pushes back on rampant misinformation (CNBC)
* Coronavirus will likely become a pandemic, warns ex-FDA chief Scott Gottlieb (CNBC)
* Goldman Sachs (GS) is in talks to offer small business loans to merchants on Amazon’s (AMZN) sprawling e-commerce platform. The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC)
* The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell’s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry’s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry’s data and subscription base. For Harry’s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC)
* Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with “advanced lung cancer.” Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment. Last night, Trump tweeted about Limbaugh’s diagnosis, calling the host “a great guy &amp; fantastic political talent,” and wishing him “a speedy recovery.” (CNBC)

Tesla Stock Hits $780 Raising More Than 80% Since the Start of the Year

Elon Musk’s Tesla has shut the critics with its overwhelming performance in Q4 2019. Tesla (TSLA) stock has stormed Wall Street with its price surging a whopping over 80% since the beginning of 2020.

Short-sellers are burning their hands on Tesla as the electric car maker released its strong Q4 2019 numbers last week. In less than a week, the Tesla stock has added over $200 to its price making it the first American automobile company to hit $100-billion valuations.

On Monday, February 3rd, the Tesla stock surged 20% to $780 levels taking the company’s valuations at $140 billion. Indeed, with this move, Tesla has taken Wall Street and global investors by surprise. Monday’s stock price gain was the biggest one-day surge of Tesla in the last six years.

Since the beginning of 2020, the Tesla stock price is up 85% in one-of-its-kind performance. Tesla’s stock performance has forced analysts to revise the calculation and set up new targets ahead.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**The decline**

Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. 

Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space.

**The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities**

Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 

2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. 

Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have *nothing.*

**A story of stagnation**

Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel.

Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

**Meeting competition**

We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP\* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat.

Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. 

A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details.

\*MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.”

**The future**

Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”.

These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

If you have any questions or I got something wrong tell me in the comments, also do not blame any of the people and or sources mentioned, all opinions expressed are solely mine, and may not reflect other’s.

Basically to sum up my question, what is the best site/company to trade with?  Is it possible for me to buy shares in companies like Tesla or other American companies or am I restricted to Canadian companies?

I live in the UK, and over the last 6 months I've been buying shares in Tesla via Interactive Investor. Thankfully they've paid off really well, and I'd like to cash out.

Over this time I've paid about $5600 for these shares, and they're currently worth $15000. I probably should have asked this before investing, but what tax am I subject to paying when selling out?

I've used an S&amp;S ISA so AFAIK I'm not subject to UK tax for this amount - or is this only applicable to UK investments?

I'm also aware that I may be subject to US capital gains due to it being a US company.. am I wrong here?

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open, but not close to erasing a significant portion of Friday’s coronavirus-driven sell-off. The Dow had its worst day since August on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 since October. Both were pushed into negative territory for January. The Dow is now at its lowest since Dec. 18, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at its lowest since Dec. 30. The Nasdaq, however, did manage to finish January with a 2% gain. (CNBC)
* Chinese markets plunged on their return from the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and maintained steep declines by the close. The Shanghai composite fell 7.72% while the Shenzhen component dropped 8.45%. The moves in Chinese stocks were playing catch up as the coronavirus outbreak continues to widen. (CNBC)
* On today’s U.S. economic calendar, both the ISM manufacturing Index and December construction spending are released at 10 a.m. ET. Food distributor Sysco (SYY) is one of the few companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning, while Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) grabs the spotlight in today’s after-the-bell reports. The pace of earnings reports picks up substantially over the next few days, with 86 S&amp;P 500 companies scheduled to issue numbers. (CNBC)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg all have a good chance to leave today’s first-in-the-nation Iowa presidential caucuses with the most delegates. Recent polls show a tight race, and the fluid nature of the caucuses suggest any of the leading candidates could enjoy a surprisingly strong showing in the first nominating contest. (CNBC)

Thousands of medical workers in Hong Kong went on strike, in hopes of convincing the city’s government to a complete shutdown of its borders with the mainland. (CNBC)
* Bernard Ebbers, a former telecom executive convicted in one of the largest corporate accounting scandals in U.S. history, died yesterday, just over a month after his early release from prison. The Canadian-born Ebbers was convicted in New York in 2005 on securities fraud and other charges and received a 25-year sentence. (AP)
* WeWork reportedly intends to name Sandeep Mathrani, a veteran in the real estate industry, as its new CEO. Mathrani was previously CEO at Brookfield Properties’ retail group, and is on the executive board and board of trustees for the International Council of Shopping Centers and the board of directors of Host Hotels &amp; Resorts. (CNBC)
* It took 50 years, but the wait is now over for the Kansas City Chiefs after coming back from a 10-point deficit in the third quarter to beat the San Francisco 49ers at Super Bowl LIV at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. The Chiefs, which last appeared in a Super Bowl in 1970, won their second Vince Lombardi Trophy in three Super Bowl appearances. (CNBC)

&gt;A French court on Friday approved a deal allowing Airbus to pay 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) in fines to Britain, France and the US to settle corruption cases sparked by suspicious equipment sales.

&gt;One of the allegations cited in a judgement and released by a London court Friday concerned the purchase of aircraft by SriLankan Airlines.

&gt;Investigators had accused Airbus of failing to prevent persons associated with the company from bribing directors or employees of the airline to ""obtain or retain business or advantage"".

&gt;Gotabaya Rajapaksa's office said the president had ordered a comprehensive investigation into the reports.

&gt;Sri Lanka's previous government also called for a criminal investigation into the 2013 purchase of 10 Airbus aircraft, but it petered out without conclusion.

&gt;Sri Lanka's national carrier is deeply in the red, with estimated accumulated losses of $1.24 billion and debt of about $750 million.

The recommendations are as far as the European Union can go in dictating policy to its member nations, whose governments will have the final word on whether and how they want to let Huawei help build their next generation of wireless telecommunications networks.

I can see a few scenarios playing out:

1. Monday gap down.  China opens way down, US futures sell off early.  Market opens down 10-20.   
 This scenario better for the bulls - look for the market to grind higher from an overnight gap down, then build support over the next several days.  
2. Monday big gap down.  Similar to #1, but gap is 40+ points and panic sellers enter the market at open.  Look for the 200 day sma to come into play with increased volatility for the next few weeks.
3. Gap up Monday.  Possibly the market gaps up on Monday.  Needs to quickly retrace 70-80% of Friday's move lower or further downside likely in the days to follow - 200 day sma likely target.

One can look at the charts for the past 2 or 3 years and see these types of price action are predominant.

# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**
*****
&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.
*****
&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.
*****
&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.
*****
&gt; China’s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.
*****
&gt; # Correction or pull back?
&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January’s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.
*****
&gt; “February is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it’s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. “I call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,” said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s a good possibility, just based on valuation—over 19.6 times forward earnings. That’s the most since 2002,” he said. “By my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.” A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.
*****
&gt; “People have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,” said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. “We believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.” Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.
*****
&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday’s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.
*****
&gt; “I still think it’s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don’t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn’t really change my view,” she said. “I still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,” she said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said it’s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders’ policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.
*****
&gt; “Only 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,” he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.
*****
&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing’s production shut down.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.
*****
&gt; Stovall said he’s watching “a combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,” he said.
*****
&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become “inverted.” An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China’s economy and the world economy.

# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!

&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**

&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.

# Short Circuit

&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**

&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.

# 49ers Or Chiefs?

&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but “data don’t lie”: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn’t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.

&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.

&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we’ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “There have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And wouldn’t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.”

&gt; Here’s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.

&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we’re glad the Patriots aren’t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.

# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm

&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October—spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index’s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven’t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn’t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.

&gt; “The coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002–2003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.”

&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.

&gt; We certainly don’t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003—several months into the 2003–2007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.

&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus

&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.

&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.

&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.

&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.

&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.

&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.

&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.

When I was 11 years old, my step dad helped me invest $850 I had saved up in my first stock.  It was 1996 or so, and the first tech boom was just a few years away.  

By the time I was 15-16 I had a full portfolio and was rocking it.  I had around $50k invested.  All from money I made working at a flower shop, computer repair shop, (and selling a bit of pot too if I am being honest), and buying stocks.  I was going to be the next Warren Buffett of course ... lol.

In 1999-2001 day trading took the internet by storm.  Even your cab driver had trading tips back then.  I got sucked in with many others, and I also got wiped out.  By 20 years old, I had blown out my account to 0 on dumb options plays, not knowing what I was doing and taking idiotic risk that I didn't fully understand.

For a decade I avoided the market mostly, even though it had once been such a passion.  I got a degree.  Went into a different industry.

Sadly at some point along the way again, I thought I could be a 'trader'.  I went through similar cycles as the first time (perhaps with a bit more knowledge, wisdom and maturity than the first time).  The game is even harder now though.  The HFT's and Algo's are programmed just so perfectly to squeeze out your money, even if it is one penny at a time.  Once again, after wasting many years, I found myself at the bottom.

I will spare you the rest and jump straight to the ending:  I am nearing 36 years old, and my portfolio is nearly non existent.  I am not poor, and I own a nice little business ... but I am also filled with regret.  

Had I never started trading, and had I just continued investing, I would probably be a multi millionaire based on the trajectory I was headed by this point.  I also would have gotten to skip many years of shame, doubt and guilt.  

The amount of people in this day and age that are actually successful traders are so god damn few and far in between.  There is a reason the entire world has moved to quant systems.  Computers trade better than humans filled with emotions.  

Moral of the story for you youngins' out there:  Buy and hold.  Maybe don't buy today at the peak of a fed induced 10+ year bull run and wait for a market correction in the next few years (ironic that I would be giving financial advice by the way), but when the opportunity strikes .... buy and hold.  Make smart investments.   Don't take dumb un-necessary risks.  Sometimes the boring stocks are the absolute best ones.

The stock market shouldn't be exciting.  It shouldn't be something that makes you lose sleep or feel anxiety.  It shouldn't be 'fun'.

Brothers Neil and Jay Shah, President and CEO respectively, bought a combined $100,000 in their seventh joint purchase over the past 6 months in the REIT that owns 48 upscale/luxury  hotels in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC, South Florida, and the West Coast. 

Valued at 6.1x AFFO Hersha Hospitality Trust already looks cheap with a discount to NAV of 37% and a yield of 8.6% based on an AFFO payout rate of just 56%. 

Those metrics should improve further as numerous upgrades have disrupted operations but should start adding to cash flow growth in the near term.  Specifically, two of the REIT’s most profitable hotels in south Florida are operational again (after Hurricane Irma in 2017) and are expected to boost EBITDA by 20-25%.

Hotel REITs are out of favor at the moment but $HT’s already cheap valuation offers downside protection while 20%+ AFFO growth provides a tangible catalyst for upside supported by insider buying.

**Grand Canyon Education** $LOPE dropped 16% to $78 after a Citron report on Tuesday  called it “The Educational Enron” and lowered their Price Target from $30 to $0

“Citron believes that management of Grand Canyon has been both incompetent and deceitful in its ability to transform the school to adapt to the rapidly changing for profit education space.”

Citron Research also say that “\[t\]he corporate structure between Grand Canyon Education and Grand Canyon University is one that the SEC should investigate. GCE’s revenues are almost entirely from Grand Canyon University. Having a captive customer that is 90% of revenues with the same CEO and no “Chinese wall” does not pass the smell test.”  Additionally, “Citron believes GCE is stuffing GCU with expenses to inflate its own profitability and as a result bankrupting GCU.”

Citron says “In light of the significant fraud we have uncovered, we are lowering our Price Target from $30 previously to $0”

**Acceleron** jumps 70%, after reporting on Phase 2 trials on Tuesday, but as the only drug for a $10 billion TAM its $4.8bn market cap still looks reasonable

According to Fool;

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a condition in which a patient has high blood pressure in the lungs. This means that the part of the heart responsible for pumping oxygen to the lungs, the right ventricle, has to work even harder to do its job. Eventually, this can lead to right ventricular failure and death.

At the moment, there are no drugs that specifically treat PAH and as far as I can see the market is growing and expected to hit $10 billion in 2026.

With the only cure for a fatal disease, a large market share and big margins would seem reasonable assumption for any forecasts.  Back of the envelope, a 50% share at 20% margins and 14x PE would justify a market cap of $14 billion. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Microsoft** $MSFT jumped on Wednesday after a strong performance across the board and a thriving cloud business helped revenues and earnings grow 14% and 37% respectively. Guidance suggests the company expects its strong growth to continue and MSFT has a habit of underpromising and overdelivering.  The stock has had a remarkable run up but, even on 30x trailing earnings it still looks like good value.

**Farfetch** $FTCH jumped 10% after reporting a $250 million investment on Thursday from Tencent and west coast investment firm Dragoneer that will increase the company’s exposure to China and help to finance its technology platform. 

Farfetch is a high-end fashion retailer that carries no inventory which is a major advantage when the risk of getting stuck with expensive stock you cannot sell is significant. Instead the company runs an online marketplace where more than 1,000 retailers and 3 million customers from over 50 countries. Growth has been spectacular with revenue increasing by 50%+ for several years in a row.

This rapid growth has led to increasing networking effects and allows Farfetch to charge a 25% to 33% commission fee on sales made through its site. Current year forecast sales are still modest at just under $1 billion. Equally modest, in comparison to the opportunity, is the current market capitalization of $2.74 billion. The $300 billion global market for luxury products is in the midst of a structural shift to online and Farfetch, with its network effects, is in prime position to benefit.

“Tencent’s deep technology expertise and ongoing relationship with Farfetch, paired with Dragoneer’s expertise in supporting growth-oriented technology companies, makes both investors outstanding partners to support Farfetch’s next chapter of growth,” commented Farfetch founder and CEO José Neves.

Plant-based burger maker **Beyond Meat** $BYND dropped 15% this week as it emerged that the company is facing a lawsuit from former business partner Don Lee over claims the company misappropriated its trade secrets and broke a contract. 

Don Lee alleges that it helped Beyond develope the “beyond meat” product using its own family secret while they were partners.  When Beyond Meat left the partnership, it allegedly took Don Lee’s family secrets with and reportedly shared those secrets with other competitors in order to develop similar products.  The trial is to begin officially on May 18th.

**Grocery Outlet** $GO dropped 7% after reporting a secondary offering, even though it was non diluting, but this is a stock that is definitely worth a closer look.  The company has been called the TJ Maxx of grocery and its business model is very similar. It sells branded goods at discounts of 40%-70% by acting as a clearing channel for producers. That offers a treasure hunt experience for buyers and useful way to offload excess inventory for producers.

I was initially sceptical of the ability to implement the model for grocery but the results speak for themselves. In November, the company reported strong Q3 earnings with revenues up 13.1%, comparable store sales up 5.8%, adjusted net income up 58.8% and adjusted EBITDA up 13.2%. Full year guidance was raised across the board with EPS rising from 69 cents to 73.5 cents at the midpoint (and comparable to 18 cents last year).

It is true that the company has to buy and sell certain staples such as bread and milk like any other grocery store. However it appears that there is a huge range of goods (dry goods, cereals, wines, deli, frozen etc) that lend themselves very well to the model. Opportunistic purchases of fresh produce such as meat, fruit and vegetables enhance the product range.

The two drivers for this business are;

* There is a huge opportunity, Grocery Outlet currently has 330 locations but believes there is demand nationwide for 4,800 stores
* Grocery Outlet (similar to TJ Maxx) is establishing itself as the go to market place for both producers and consumers. That leads to a virtuous circle of more high quality goods, more variety, more customers, more high quality goods.

The stock isn’t cheap on 40x current year estimates but, given the size of the opportunity, the valuation appears very justifiable.

On Monday, **Sorrento Therapeutics**' $SRNE board of directors unanimously rejected a proposal to acquire a majority or all of the company's shares for up to $7 per share (current $3.83). They concluded that the offer ""significantly undervalues the company and is not in the best interest of the shareholders.""

Sorrento has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $763 million (after the recent increase).

The $7 bid follows two bids in December between $3-$5 which Sorrento immediately declined saying “the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders."" The recent $7 bid suggests other parties may very well agree. Either way, management clearly think the company’s value is well in excess of yesterdays close at $3.83 and, with all their insider knowledge, they probably know more than most.

**Hepion Pharmaceuticals** $HEPA (WARNING SPECULATIVE NANO CAP)  jumped on Wednesday after positive findings from a Phase 1 expanded study

Hepion's drug candidate ""CRV431 offers a novel approach to the treatment of fibrosis caused by NASH and possibly other causes of liver injury,"" stated Dr. Robert Foster, CEO of Hepion Pharmaceuticals. ""This is because CRV431 acts, in part, by directly targeting fibrotic scar formation by down-regulating an important regulator of collagen synthesis, cyclophilin B, thereby reducing collagen production. This contrasts with most other NASH drug candidates that target events such as dyslipidemia or diabetes that may lead to fibrosis. Combining the direct antifibrotic actions of CRV431 with the indirect actions of other drug candidates likely represents the best opportunity for rapidly and effectively decreasing liver fibrosis in NASH.""

The global Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) market is expected to cross US$20.0 Billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of more than 10.0% during given forecast period from 2018-2025.  Hepion has a long way to go before approval or commercialization of its drug and has since given back most of its gains.  However, with a market cap f just $18 million, even a small chance of developing a successful treatment for such a large prize makes this an interesting stock.

I watched Master the Market's video on how to trade stocks with $500. I couldn't  link. It's about buying Tradenet's opportunity to use 14k to trade. They give you education prior. I'm sure many of you are familiar with it. This is an incredible thing I never knew existed. I want to be able to do this. However, here are my questions I was hoping you guys could help me with...

Is the 350 discount referenced in the video still available or is it expired?
Is there a specification that it has to be day trading or would I be able to just trade actively?
Since my access to the internet is limited to after markets are closed typically, will I be able to place trade orders at night and have them executed automatically in the morning?
Is Tradenet the only website that offers such an opportunity or is there another one I should consider?

I understand I am at an extreme disadvantage given my limited access to the markets. Understand that I (hypothetically) have very little when I get released and believe these next few years are a great time to prepare for that due to lack of financial obligations. I believe the market is strong and this is a perfect opportunity given my situation. Please give me some advice. I want to place myself in the best position  to succeed upon release.

&gt;1) The stock doesn’t reach the strike price, and you pocket the premium as pure profit.

&gt;2) The stock reaches the strike price and the option is exercised. You have to sell your shares, but you still made money because you’re still *selling the shares at a higher price* (assuming you bought them for a similar or lower price than they were at the call creation).


Obviously option 2 can make you *not as much* as you would’ve made by holding the shares, if the stock climbs beyond the premium break-even price. But it seems impossible to *lose* money.

I've only been investing for a little over a year now and am starting to get a better understanding of how markets move with current events, what's noise, what's real, etc. 

With the latest pandemic in the news cycle, I'm wondering if there is anyone out there with a good market-centric perspective on the last number of outbreaks. 

Some things I'm wondering are: 

\- How long does the market react to the bad news? During SARS was the biggest sell off during the time when people were trying to get a handle on the disease and there was plenty of room for panic/speculation or was it in the quarters afterward that would've shown depressed earnings from lost productivity? 

\- How far out did the outbreak affect earnings? China will lose productivity for x months due to the outbreak. Does that show up in the next quarter or the next 3 quarters, for example? Did the market tend to price in those drops in earnings reports before they reported? 

\- At what point in the outbreak timeline did you feel like things recovered? A quarter after the outbreak  was under control? A year?

I bought Abbvie at a higher price and am currently down ~10%.

They have their earnings report coming at the end of next week, so I was wondering if this is a good time to buy more?

My limited experience tells me yes, since although they lose Humira exclusivity in 2023, they have acquired Allergan. Also, I’ve read reports they manufacture a drug that can cure the Corona virus (possible short term gain?). Finally, analysts expect a EPS of $2.2, which is around $0.30 more than same quarter last year.

Left leaning people are in love with the concept of transitioning to Green energy and EVs to stop Climate Change, so they were on board from day one, especially in the deeply Blue California that meant a whole lot of sales for the company there.

Then you have Republicans/Trump's party or whatever that's called today. As soon as the company became large enough to be in the news cycle, these people started seeing jobs and Star and Stripes cars and car components as well as a car manufacturer which didn't require a (huge) bailout .

On the opposite side of the spectrum you have Google, Facebook (also Amazon) which are hated in a bipartisan way. Leftists think they are monopolies and should be broken up, Right wingers think they are biased and censoring them because they are politically left-leaning (again Cali) so they should be broken up.

So my questions are :

1) If Facebook or Google were to get a masters of the narratives and cohercion similar to Elon Musk on board as the CEO (in the case of Google) or as an aide to the CEO (in the case of Facebook) how much market cap would they gain?

2) Alternatively if Tesla were to lose its masters of narratives and cohercion how much would the company be worth?

3) Would this matter? Is it Musk which is good selling narratives or is it a matter of business model? AKA Tesla's business model is popular whereas Google's and Facebook isn't

This is a way to try and calculate how much market cap is worth having a bipartisan support.

I think it's worth something but I had discussion in the past with people who know about this stuff and they said it's not worth a lot because the scenario is binary so as long as the government isn't actively trying to break a company apart this is not worth anything.

I wanted to keep holding them for Monday when Shanghai opens, but it worries me due to two reasons:

1. The past few days of watching YANG, it has become evident that it goes up when S&amp;P 500 is down and goes down when S&amp;P 500 is up, regardless of how poorly the FTSE 50 China performed. FTSE 50 China tanked multiple days in a row, but YANG only really went up when S&amp;P 500 went down too. I noticed this several times.

2. Due to this, I'm uncertain how the price of an ETF like YANG is actually calculated. Theoretically, Monday morning when Chinese stocks almost certainly tank in Shanghai, I'd think YANG would be up quite a bit. However, due to the pattern I noticed in relation to S&amp;P 500, it worries me that US markets will open green and therefore YANG would barely go up at all, if any. As an example, YANG was actually down 3% despite the FTSE 50 China being down 3% that day.

There's a ton of doubt about this merger, but I for one can't fathom it not going through. It would make no logical sense for a judge to deny a merger under the grounds that it would create less competition (which is what the states are suing over) for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

* If the deal falls through, Sprint wouldn't survive independently anyway
   * It could potentially be bought out by a number of other companies in this case
* In exchange for the deal, Sprint has a deal to sell off Boost mobile to Dish networks which would maintain a cheaper cellular service alternative
* T-Mobile has made an agreement not to raise any prices on any of their plans for a number of years after the deal
* This plan would allow T-Mobile to make custom deals with varying degrees of connection once they combine Sprint's bandwidth with their own

&amp;#x200B;

If and when this merger is accepted in the following weeks, the price is bound to rise past $7.83 which is the value that the merger offer places Sprint stock at. The last time it was believed the merger was going through, $S jumped to over $8.50. It currently sits at $4.37 as I type this. 

The new T-Mobile will immediately become a powerhouse player and start eating away at Verizon and AT&amp;T's market share. It will position them to have the best 5G in existence due to Sprint's investments in the technology over the years. 

Another motive for this merger is to beat Huawei at 5G coverage in the states. It would be a serious injustice for us to stop this kind of technological race from completing over a bunch of district attorneys trying to act virtuous for political points. 

It's unlikely that a failure to merge would really destroy Sprint as a whole. They've just set up a round of a billion dollars in funding to helpcover their debts. I can't imagine $S falling below $3.40 if this fails.

Let's say there's a 40% chance of this merger going through. In poker, if you have a 40% chance of winning a hand with a promise of 200% return on your investment, and the risk is only a 25% loss if you're wrong, you gamble. No brainer.

* A volatile final day of January could be ahead, as headlines surrounding the impact of the coronavirus continue to emerge and U.S. stock futures point to a lower open. Thursday was a prime example, with the Dow falling as many as 244 points and then rallying along with the other major averages to finish higher. The Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq remain poised to post their fifth straight month of gains, although they could also post a second straight weekly loss for the first time in four months. (CNBC)
* US Treasury yields rise after briefly sending a recession signal (CNBC)
* The World Health Organization said the fast-spreading coronavirus that’s now infected more than 9,800 people across the world is a global health emergency, a rare designation that helps the international agency mobilize financial and political support to contain the outbreak. Shortly before, the U.S. confirmed the nation’s first person-to-person transmission of the virus. (CNBC)
* Facebook to remove coronavirus misinformation after WHO declares global emergency (Reuters)
* State Department issues ‘do not travel’ advisory for China, asks those in the country to consider leaving (CNBC)
* Two patients from the same family in England have tested positive for the coronavirus. England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said today his team was “working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had,” in order to prevent further spread. (CNBC)
* The week ends with a busy morning of U.S. economic data, beginning with December personal income and spending at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Chicago purchasing managers index is out at 9:45 a.m. ET, and the University of Michigan’s final January consumer sentiment index is out at 10 a.m. ET.

* Caterpillar earnings top expectations, but CEO warns about ‘global economic uncertainty’ (CNBC)
* Shares of Amazon (AMZN) climbed nearly 9% in premarket trading after smashing earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. The company’s market cap surged above $1 trillion. Amazon first hit a $1 trillion market cap in September 2018 but went below that level after the stock market at the time tanked. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are all currently above the trillion-dollar threshold. (CNBC)
* Jeff Bezos’ net worth jumps by over $12 billion after Amazon’s big quarter (CNBC)
* IBM shares jumped as much as 5% in the premarket after the company said Arvind Krishna will become its 10th CEO, replacing Ginni Rometty, effective April 6. During Rometty’s tenure as CEO, which began in 2012, shares of IBM fell about 26%, compared to the S&amp;P 500′s advance of 160%. (CNBC)
* Retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander said he’ll vote against any proposals for further witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, dealing a blow to Democrats. if the GOP-majority chamber votes, likely today, not to allow that new content, then the trial could quickly proceed to a final vote on whether to acquit Trump or remove him from office. (CNBC)
* House of Representatives passes two measures limiting Trump’s ability to go to war with Iran (CNBC)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders has jumped into a virtual tie with former Vice President Joe Biden nationally just before the first nominating contests in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released today. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is in third, while former Mayor Mike Bloomberg leaped ahead of Mayor Pete Buttigieg for fourth. (CNBC)
* Sanders backed by 200,000-member postal workers union in 2020 primary (CNBC)
* After more than three years of tough negotiations between British and European officials, its departure from the EU is finally taking place today at 6 p.m. ET. The departure will mark the start of a “transition period” in which the U.K. remains a member of the single market and customs union, but begins negotiations with the EU in the hope of striking a free trade deal. (CNBC)
* One Medical parent 1Life Healthcare (ONEM) priced its initial public offering at $14 per share, at the bottom of the expected range of $14-$16 per share. The health care services firm, which is not yet profitable, raised $245 million in gross proceeds through JPMorgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS).
* Here’s a look at the road to Sunday’s Super Bowl by the numbers: After more than 4,000 plays, 1,000 points and 125 touchdowns between them, the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs made it to the big game. The Chiefs have relied on a big-play passing game led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, while the Niners have had plenty of success on the defensive side. (AP)

Situation:
Investor bought the one of the same stock three times.
1 Stock X @20
1 Stock X @25
1 Stock X @30

Stock X has now risen to 80 and Investor considers selling one to cash in on profits as he has a need for some equity. He wants to keep the two other ones. 

Which one will he sell? That is where I am struggling. I’d say he will sell the one he bought for 20 first because he will make the biggest profit from that. And then my non-finance brain thinks all the stocks are the same. It’s like having any other items three times: it does not matter which one you sell, they all are worth 80 at this point of time.

I am a newbie who just read a book on this topic and never bought a single share in his life. 

Help me understand the theory behind it all:

From what I understand the goal is to: 

• 1) Research what company is successful in it‘s market

• 2) Buy shares of that company

• 3) Wait at least 10 years for noticeable returns 

• 4) Never sell shares out of anxiety or fear of a bear market

• 5) Never try to time the market (selling as well as buying)

When a company increases it‘s revenue, it increases its value and therefore the value of my shares. Some will also pay Devidends apart from that.

If that’s all it takes why can’t I just buy shares in companies who have proven to be successful over the years and become another Warren Buffet? What point am I missing here? What is the hard part of it all?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

First time poster here, trying to understand stop limits and how to properly execute them.

From what I've read, a stop limit is a condition I can use to ensure the stock sells at a certain price. For example, I have 10 shares of AMZN and it's currently at $2,074 (I got in at $1,764...woohoo!). I want to make sure I close my position if it goes below $2,000 so I can make profit, and rebuy later on. Is this how a stop limit works?

Backstory: I've been in AMZN since the summer on and off, and have been holding since $1,764. Now that I've experienced the volatility of AMZN, I want to make sure I make some profit from it and rebuy it later on (given the overall market conditions, Coronavirus affecting the global market, etc.). Thank you for the advice!!

But I wanted to ask if there is a platform that aggregates company news in a meaningful way (e.g. filings, commentary and maybe even analyst reports?)

It would be great if it would work even for non-U.S. companies.

Any Ideas? Any suggestion is welcomed.

Best,

January 30, 2020 - TheNewswire - Vancouver, Canada - Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (the "" Company "" or "" Guyana Goldstrike "") (TSXV: GYA ) , ( OTC:GYNAF ) , ( FSE:1ZT ) is pleased to announce that the Company has selected drill targets at the Marudi Gold Project ("" Marudi "" or the ""Property"" , or the "" Project "") located in Guyana, South America.

The Company's 2018/19 trenching program successfully outlined a new mineralized area that continues for more than 1.75 kilometres along Toucan Ridge (see map below). Toucan Ridge is roughly one kilometre northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone which currently contains the Project's mineral resource estimate (please see "" Mineral Resource Estimate "" below).

A diamond drill program of up to 12 holes is planned and may be extended. The planned drill program will predominately focus on Toucan Ridge where a total of 2,458 metres of trenching was completed and 837 samples were taken.

Drill targets have been chosen from identified magnetic anomalies and gold assays from surface trenching and sampling of the quartzite-metachert host rock.

The specific drill locations will be in proximity to trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8, as priority targets, followed potentially by drilling trench areas TTR-18-9, TTR-18-11, TTR-18-12, and TTR-18-13.

In 2018, trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 assayed grades as high as 7.2 g/t Au over 3 metres.

The first drill pads will be positioned to drill angled holes across the area of trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 to an initial planned depth of 130 metres and a maximum depth of 200 metres.

In preparation for the next phase of exploration, the technical team has reviewed the legacy data, including drill assays, drill angles, collar location, grade and interval lengths from past drilling on the Property in order to further refine its exploration efforts at Marudi. The compilation of these historic drill assays will provide important information that the technical team will use to calibrate drilling on the Property.

The following assay highlights are from the Mazoa Hill Zone which is approximately one kilometre south west of the Toucan Ridge discovery area:

Assay Highlights of Sutton Resources Diamond Drill Programs 1991-94 - Mazoa Hill Zone:

* \- MR 91-068 - 6 metres of 29.97 g/t Au; within 72 metres of 5.11 g/t Au  
\- MR 91-074 - 15 metres of 15.30 g/t Au; within 75.00 metres of 4.60 g/t Au  
\- MR 94-102 - 52 metres of 4.06 g/t Au; within 190 metres of 2.39 g/t Au  
\- MR 94-113 - 36 metres of 7.74 g/t Au; within 141 metres of 3.31 g/t Au  
\- MR 94-115 - 45 metres of 10.82 g/t Au and 30 metres of 15.16 g/t Au; within 81 metres of 7.71 g/t Au  
\- MR 94-120 - 12 metres of 16.65 g/t Au; within 57 metres of 4.51 g/t Au

Please note: Interval lengths are not true widths.

&amp;#x200B;

Mineral Resource Estimates

The Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open in several directions including at depth.

* \- 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 g/t;  
\- 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 g/t

For further information concerning the Mazoa Hill Zone Resource Estimate, readers are encouraged to review "" Technical Report: Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate "", a technical report prepared for the Company by Global Mineral Resource Services and is available at: [GYA Mazoa Hill Zone 43-101 ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/images/pdf/43101_Report_Guyana_Goldstrike_Mazoa_Hill_Zone_Jan_2018.pdf), at the Company's website [www.guyanagoldstrike.com ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/)and under the Company's profile on [www.sedar.com ](http://www.sedar.com/).

Readers are cautioned that although the Project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining license a production decision has not been reached by the Company in respect of the Project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the Project. Also note, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The Company also announces that Frontier Flex Marketing (Frontier) continues to provide investor relations and marketing services to the Company. The agreement with Frontier commenced on January 2019, with remuneration of $7,000 per month. The services were put on hiatus for an extended period in 2019. The Company has re-commenced services as of January 2020. This was part of an extension and revision to an original agreement with Frontier Merchant Capital for similar investor relations and marketing services that was signed on January 2018, with remuneration of $5,000 per month. Frontier Merchant Capital were also granted 50,000 stock options of the Company at 25 cents in January 2018 and 150,000 stock options at 30 cents on October 30, 2018.

About Guyana Goldstrike Inc.

The Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project, which has a 17-year mining license and is located in Guyana, South America. Historic diamond drilling completed on the Project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. A mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Mazoa Hill Zone. Data analyzed suggests the zone is open to mineralization in multiple directions and at depth.

Through the recent exploration program, the Company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the Company has over 45 sq. kms of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the Project.

About Guyana

The Republic of Guyana is located in South America adjacent to Suriname. The country is English speaking and its legal system is based on British common law with a democratically elected government. It has an established mining act and a rich history of gold production. The Fraser Institute's 2016 Annual Survey of Mining listed Guyana as the third best mining jurisdiction with regards to investment attractiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean Basin sub-group. The Guiana Shield is the geographic gold-hosting region and is world-recognized as a premier gold region that is highly prospective, under-explored and has geological continuity with West Africa. Barrick has recently announced that the Giuana Shield will be their priority region for discovery opportunities and early stage exploration.\* Exxon Recently announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels of offshore oil with production scheduled for first quarter of 2020. This discovery will designate Guyana as having the fastest growing GPD in 2020, estimated to be 86%.\*\*

I am currently studying finance and trading and i am currently using Investopedia simulator to apply what i have understood so far.

The game does not allow me to do that though and only allows me to sell the option which costs less than I paid it for (0,97 per share vs 0,94 now, maybe because near expiration?). Then after searching the web i realized that options are most of the time sold, not exercised. This does not make much sense to me, and i really don't get why the simulator does not let me do this.

The span of powerful gaming rigs and workstations is around 5 years, so if 70% of the people made theirs before the AMD release they would have used Intel chips and all that jazz. So we won't see a significant rise in the sales until people start upgrading, and they will go with AMD, because they're crushing right now. So best case scenario everyone built their rig around 5 years ago they are upgrading now, worst case they built it the day before AMD releases and we have to wait 5 years.
